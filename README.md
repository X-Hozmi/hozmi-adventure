
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses’ hooves kicking up plumes of ochre sand.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resolve at every turn.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant struggle against the elements and the unknown, but the lure of untold riches and legendary knowledge fueled their weary steps onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  Advanced technology offered a measure of safety, but the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the existential dread of unimaginable distances challenged the crew’s courage and technical prowess, making their interstellar voyage a relentless fight for survival and discovery.
