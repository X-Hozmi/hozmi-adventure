
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel contained not gold, but a vital message for the King, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both rider and steed. Yet, the urgent need to deliver the missive spurred her onward, each creak of the saddle a testament to the adventure, and the risk, of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', pierced the inky void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby as she navigated the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos Cluster.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also a lonely and dangerous place.  Alien encounters, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were the price of galactic exploration, yet the thrill of discovery fuelled her onward.
