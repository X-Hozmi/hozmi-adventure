
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her meager supplies were dwindling, but the promise of the rumored lost city of Ys fueled her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for banditry, famine, or worse – yet the thrill of the unknown, the quest for something beyond the confines of her village, spurred her onward through perilous forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  The journey was arduous, but the adventure was intoxicating.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos Cluster was child's play compared to the political minefields and alien encounters she'd faced on her current mission.  The quest for the legendary Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of warping space itself, had taken her light-years from her home planet, pitting her against ruthless corporations and enigmatic alien races.  The vastness of space was terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure, the ultimate adventure for a pilot willing to risk everything for the chance to rewrite history.
