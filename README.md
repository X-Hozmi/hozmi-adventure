The dusty track snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and brooding forests, each bend promising new peril and adventure.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield, but the weight of a king's decree, a quest to forge an alliance with a distant, rumored-to-be-magical kingdom.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were merely inconveniences on this grand journey across the known world.  His fate, and perhaps the fate of his kingdom, rested on his ability to traverse this medieval tapestry of danger and intrigue.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet light-years from known space.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the vast, uncaring expanse of the galaxy.  Her mission: to survey Xylos for potential colonization, a perilous undertaking with unknown dangers lurking among the alien flora and fauna, not to mention the possibility of encountering other sentient life.   The stars themselves were her guide, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown, but for Eva, the boundless cosmos held far greater rewards than any earthly realm.
