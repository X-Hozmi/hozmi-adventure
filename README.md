
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the clang of their swords against marauders, the warmth of meager campfires, and the breathtaking beauty of landscapes untouched by the encroaching darkness of war.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset a reminder of the enormity of their task and the dangers that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take years, even decades, traversing wormholes and navigating uncharted asteroid fields.  The weight of responsibility, the loneliness of interstellar space, and the constant hum of the ship’s engines were her constant companions. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the potential for discovery, and the hope of finding her lost kin propelled her forward, a lone explorer charting humanity's destiny among the stars.
