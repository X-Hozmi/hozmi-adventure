
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a testament to countless revisions and tear-stained corrections, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sparked a fresh wave of anxiety, yet the lure of the rumored lost city, and the whispered promise of unimaginable riches, fueled her onward.  The journey was perilous, fraught with bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the thrill of the unknown spurred her relentlessly.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, the cosmic dust painting vibrant streaks across her viewport.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy had already claimed countless vessels, swallowed whole by gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids.  Yet, Rexa, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, felt the familiar thrill of risk coursing through her veins.  The cosmos, vast and indifferent, offered both unimaginable danger and the tantalizing promise of discovery – a gamble she was more than willing to take.
