
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel bumping against her thigh.  This journey to the distant monastery at Saint-Gilles is not for pilgrimage, but for a stolen map promising a hidden Templar treasure.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of the ancient forests, and whispers of a vengeful Baron follow her every step.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the lure of untold riches fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the cockpit.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Warp jumps across light-years are commonplace, yet each one carries the risk of encountering rogue asteroid fields or hostile alien patrols.  The vastness of space is both exhilarating and terrifying, but Eva's unwavering determination, fueled by the need to protect her crew and secure the galaxy's future, keeps her pressing onward towards the unknown.
