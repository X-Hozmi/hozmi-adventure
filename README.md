His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's illness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the splintered kingdoms of Aerthos. Each sunrise brought a renewed hope, tempered by the harsh realities of medieval travel, where the map was only a guide, and survival demanded resourcefulness and courage.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was a treacherous dance between gravitational wells and rogue asteroids, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life. Yet, the allure of discovery fueled her, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a testament to humanity's relentless push towards the stars and the galaxies beyond.
