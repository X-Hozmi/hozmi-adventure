
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the spires of the distant city of Avignon shimmering in the heat haze.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, the promise of a new life.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the rough terrain a challenge at every turn, but the lure of the bustling city, the whispered tales of its wealth and opportunity, spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rasp of her mule's breath, marked another step toward an uncertain future, yet one brimming with potential adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal warship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million stars.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Through asteroid fields and gravity wells, they raced against a rival corporation, the stakes higher than any earthly kingdom's treasure.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held countless dangers, from rogue planets to hostile alien life, but the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories across the galaxy, fueled their every decision.
