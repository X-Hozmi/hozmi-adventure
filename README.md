
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains, the chill wind biting at her face. Her worn map, more faded than a tapestry from a forgotten king's hall, guided her westward.  Each creaking step was a gamble – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable trails offered treacherous drops into unseen chasms.  Yet, the promise of the legendary lost city of Ys, shimmering like a mirage in her imagination, fueled her onward, a whispered legend made flesh in her relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the treacherous currents of space still demanded respect.  Xylos held the key to a long-lost alien civilization, a treasure hunt across galaxies rather than kingdoms,  and though the risks were measured in parsecs, not leagues, the thrill of discovery – and the potential for unimaginable riches – remained the same, a burning fire in the heart of every intrepid explorer.
