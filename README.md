
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's ransom, a heavy chest strapped to the beast's flanks, bounced precariously with each jarring step.  Robbers, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions on this arduous journey from London to Constantinople.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory, a testament to his unwavering resolve to complete this life-threatening quest.  The rough terrain tested his body and spirit, but the lure of untold riches, and perhaps even glory, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital life-sustaining minerals from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  While vastly different from Thomas's journey, the challenges remained strikingly similar.  Instead of bandits, she faced unpredictable asteroid fields; instead of disease, equipment malfunctions threatened her survival.  The vastness of space, an unyielding ocean of stars, was as daunting as any medieval wilderness, yet the allure of discovery, the promise of scientific advancement, fueled her intrepid spirit across the light-years.
