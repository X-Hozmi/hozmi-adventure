
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of adventure, the whispered promise of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost in the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was perilous, a constant dance between gravitational forces and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Alien landscapes, both beautiful and terrifying, awaited her – sentient plant life on Kepler-186f, and the crystalline ruins of a long-dead civilization orbiting a pulsating neutron star.  The vastness of space, however, was a far greater challenge than any bandit or mountain pass; the true adventure lay in confronting the unknown, the infinite loneliness of deep space.
