
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara in the far north, had already claimed two horses and tested their resilience against bandits, blizzards, and dwindling supplies. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty – would they find shelter, food, or even escape the looming shadow of the encroaching Black Death?  The allure of the saint's miraculous powers, however, spurred them on, a fragile ember against the overwhelming darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', its hyperdrive humming a low thrum as they jumped between galaxies.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the glittering tapestry of distant nebulae and the occasional, unnerving silence, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where the threat of cosmic anomalies and hostile alien civilizations was as real as the oxygen in their recycled air.
