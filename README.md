
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the glory awaiting him, should he survive this perilous journey across the unforgiving terrain of the known world.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both danger and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve the Chronarium, a device capable of manipulating time itself, from the derelict space station orbiting the gas giant, Kepler-186f.  The treacherous asteroid fields, the unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the potential threat of pirates were mere challenges in her relentless pursuit of the Chronarium.  The vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy offered unlimited possibilities, but only for those brave enough to risk everything to explore its breathtaking wonders and terrifying unknowns.
