
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, her worn map clutched tight in her gloved hand.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, amplified the gnawing uncertainty of her journey.  She sought the lost city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones at taverns and around crackling campfires. Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of the plague stalked her every step, but the lure of the unknown, the promise of ancient secrets, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth and shrouded in perilous, uncharted space. Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and contending with the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula tested her skills to their limits. But the thrill of discovery, the allure of the cosmos, and the hope of a breakthrough in faster-than-light travel kept her engines humming.
