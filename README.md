
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his armour dulled by relentless sun and dust, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing daughter.  Each day was a battle against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  He traversed treacherous mountain passes, forded icy rivers, and slept under a canopy of indifferent stars, his spirit fueled by the unwavering hope of a father's love.  The journey was arduous, a tapestry woven with peril and breathtaking beauty, a true test of both man and beast.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and erratic their only guide.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was commonplace; the real challenge lay in the vast, uncharted distances and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of space.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos, fueled by the hope of finding a lost civilization and uncovering the secrets of the universe.
