
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains of Provence in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of illness hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, a tapestry of bustling market towns, silent mountain passes, and the camaraderie of fellow travelers weaving together a story far richer than any whispered legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage that would take generations.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Eva's challenges were of a different nature – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, repairing warp drives under the pressure of cosmic radiation, and dealing with the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life. But the vast, glittering expanse of space, teeming with wonders beyond comprehension, fueled her insatiable desire for exploration, making the risks a small price to pay for the grand adventure unfolding before her.
