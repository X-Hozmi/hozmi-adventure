
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey’s arduous nature.  Across the windswept plains of France, I rode with my companions, a ragtag band bound together by a shared thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches rumored to lie hidden in the ancient ruins of the lost city of Ys.  Each sunrise painted the sky in breathtaking hues, a fleeting beauty that contrasted sharply with the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the creeping shadows of the encroaching forest. Our horses, weary but resilient, carried us onward, fueled by hope and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our guide.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the bridge as we navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Our mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey across uncharted space.  The vast emptiness held both terrifying beauty and the promise of discovery, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.  Yet, the camaraderie of my crew and the weight of our mission propelled us forward, driven by a determination to survive and uncover the secrets of the cosmos.
