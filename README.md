
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the rumours of spice and silk that fuelled his journey eastward.  Each creak of the cart, each wary glance at the darkening forest, represented a gamble – a test of endurance against bandits, famine, and the unknown landscapes stretching before him.  He carried with him not gold, but a burning desire for adventure and a map promising untold riches beyond the known world.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the pathways.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her breath misting in the zero-gravity cabin.  The swirling nebula outside pulsed with colours unseen on any terrestrial planet.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole, a shortcut across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda Galaxy from their own. The dangers weren't bandits or starvation, but unstable spacetime, rogue asteroids, and the chilling possibility of encountering something far beyond human comprehension in the inky black.  The allure, however, was the same: the boundless thrill of discovery.
