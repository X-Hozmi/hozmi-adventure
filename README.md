
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's band of knights crested the hill, their battered armor gleaming faintly in the harsh sun.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of verdant fields and dark forests concealing both sanctuary and peril.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the key to ending a plague ravaging their land.  Each league brought new challenges – treacherous rivers, bandits lurking in shadowed woods, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Their journey was a brutal test of endurance, their survival a testament to courage and camaraderie.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation bombarded the ship, while unpredictable asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies posed constant threats.  The crew, a diverse team of explorers and scientists, faced not only the physical dangers of interstellar travel but also the psychological strain of isolation and the weight of their mission: to find a new home for humanity.
