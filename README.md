
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the dust-choked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new perils – bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, with its whispers of exotic spices and untold riches in Cathay, fuels our journey.  Every creak of the wagon wheels is a step closer to the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Conversely, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive, a symphony of controlled chaos propelling us across the void between galaxies.  The star-strewn canvas of the cosmos is our highway, each jump a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the Andromeda galaxy.  We seek new worlds, not for silk and spices, but for life itself, for the chance to discover civilizations beyond human comprehension and expand the horizons of our interstellar empire.  The risk is monumental, the reward, potentially limitless.
