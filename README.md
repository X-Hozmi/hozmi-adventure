
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical Sunstone Valley.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, preparing her for bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements.  This journey, fraught with peril, was a pilgrimage for her family’s survival, a desperate gamble for a legendary cure to a plague sweeping their village.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' stared out the viewport of her starship, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted across the blackness. Her mission: a daring interstellar rescue operation to retrieve a team of scientists stranded on the ice planet of Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace always held a thrill, a dizzying plunge into the unknown, but the potential for engine failure or unexpected gravitational anomalies kept adrenaline pumping. The vast expanse of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held the promise of both glory and oblivion.
