
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the slow, agonizing death of the desert.  Yet, the glint of distant mountains, a promise of something beyond the endless horizon, fueled her onward.  This was a journey not just across leagues of land, but through the unforgiving heart of fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump through hyperspace had been harrowing, leaving her crew shaken but alive.  Now, the silent emptiness of space pressed in, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling static of her comms.  The vastness, the potential for catastrophic engine failure or hostile alien contact, was a constant, gnawing tension.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the secrets of a long-lost civilization, propelled her ever further into the uncharted darkness of the cosmos.
