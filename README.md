
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Each creaking cartwheel, each barking dog, each suspicious glance from a cloaked figure added to the growing tension of his perilous journey across a land scarred by war and plague.  He carried not only hope but the weight of his people’s survival on his weary shoulders.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, *The Icarus*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next breakthrough.  The jump to hyperspace had been rough, leaving her crew shaken but undeterred.  Ahead lay uncharted space, potentially hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the vast, unforgiving cosmos.  The fate of her crew, and perhaps humanity itself, rested on the success of this perilous interstellar voyage.
