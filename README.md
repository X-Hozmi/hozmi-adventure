
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a potent mix of fear and desperate hope, the very essence of medieval adventure.  Bandits, blizzards, and starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*,  the vast nebula of Xylos swirling outside her viewport.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming microbes to the newly-discovered planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potential but lacking the essential building blocks of life.   The journey across galaxies presented challenges far removed from Thomas's, yet the core of adventure remained the same:  the daunting unknown, the thrill of discovery, and the unwavering commitment to a distant goal, powered by hope and fueled by the unyielding human spirit.
