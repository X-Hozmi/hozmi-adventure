
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires fuels his relentless journey, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light years and uncharted space.  Navigation relies on ancient star charts and cutting-edge AI, while the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and pirate raiders keeps her crew on edge. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, holds both immense danger and the promise of discovery.
