
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, crested the hill.  Before him stretched the endless, undulating tapestry of the English countryside, a perilous path to the Holy Land beckoning.  Each village held the promise of meager hospitality or outright hostility, each forest harbored bandits and beasts.  His quest, a pilgrimage born of penance and fueled by faith, demanded he traverse treacherous bogs, ford raging rivers, and brave the shadowed passes of the mountains, his only companions a worn map and the unwavering glint of his sword.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth. The journey was fraught with dangers unseen – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating in the lawless reaches of space.  Her crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, relied on their advanced technology and unwavering teamwork to navigate the cosmos, their sights set on a future beyond the familiar stars.
