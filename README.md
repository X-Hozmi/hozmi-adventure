
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, more tattered than trustworthy, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty of her journey.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the perils she faced on her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a journey demanding courage, resilience, and a faith as strong as the ancient stones lining her path. Every sunrise held the promise of adventure, and every sunset brought a new challenge, forging her into a traveler both hardened and humbled by the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her starship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp drives hummed, the cosmos a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and deciphering cryptic alien signals, Jax and her crew pushed the boundaries of space exploration, their courage fueled by a desperate hope to find a lost civilization and bring an end to a centuries-long conflict across the galaxy.
