
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the kingdom was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both her courage and her steed's endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the allure of the fabled Sunstone, whispered to hold unimaginable power, pushed her forward, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each nightfall a gamble against the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova"  Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of vibrant purple and emerald.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets in the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but wormhole instability and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets made every jump a risky proposition.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of allure, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders, fueling Nova's determination to find Xylos and solve the mystery of its disappearance.
