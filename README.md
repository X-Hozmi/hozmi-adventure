
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions, and a map older than she was, guiding her across treacherous terrain to a rumored monastery said to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, flooded rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the unwavering hope for her brother's life fueled her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure, and each hardship another step closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Jax' Jackson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation. Her mission: to locate and secure a rare mineral on the edge of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that spanned light-years and untold dangers.  Cosmic storms, pirate attacks from rival corporations, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters were the hazards of space travel. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the vast unknown that stretched before her, and the allure of the uncharted territories far outweighed the risks, driving Jax and her crew further into the cosmic expanse.
