
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed canyons, and the relentless sun threatens to sap their strength before they reach their destination. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, whispered on the wind, fuels their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Warp jumps between star systems are risky, fraught with the potential for spatial anomalies and pirate attacks.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, underscores the enormity of their undertaking.  Success means survival for their crew; failure, oblivion in the cold, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.
