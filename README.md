The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering peaks clawed at the sky, while deep ravines promised certain death to any who strayed too close.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, fording raging rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes.  The quest for the lost city of Eldoria demanded unwavering courage and resilience, a test of both man and beast against the unforgiving elements and unpredictable dangers of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

The future held immense possibilities, but reaching them required daring beyond measure.
