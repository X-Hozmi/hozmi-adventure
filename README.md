
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties gathered from far-flung monasteries and intended for a desperate king.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the hope of a bountiful harvest, of aiding a people starving, spurred her onward, each step a testament to human resilience and the unwavering pursuit of a noble cause.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling cosmic storms, and facing the ever-present danger of unknown alien lifeforms, she pushed the boundaries of human exploration.  The vast, indifferent universe tested her courage, but the faint hope of finding survivors, of forging a connection across unimaginable distances, fueled her journey through the inky black.
