
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the scent of pine and fear clinging to the chill air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness, was a perilous undertaking.  Bandit-ridden roads, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the glint of hope in her brother's eyes fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any castle torch. Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, each sunset a desperate prayer for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the violet nebula, its trajectory set for Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, a glittering tapestry of distant suns and swirling cosmic dust, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Navigation was a constant struggle against unpredictable gravitational fields and the ever-present threat of space debris.  The mission: to locate a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on their dwindling homeworld.  The stakes were higher than any medieval kingdom's war, the risks far greater than any earthly plague, but the drive to survive, to secure a future for her people, propelled Ryla and her crew across the uncharted gulfs between the stars.
