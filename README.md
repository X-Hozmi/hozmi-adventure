
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging their village.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of muddy tracks, meager rations, and wary encounters with bandits and suspicious villagers.  Each sunrise brought the daunting vastness of the unknown, each sunset the gnawing fear that their journey would end not in salvation, but in unmarked graves beside the road.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the challenges remained: navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outmaneuvering hostile alien patrols, and battling the creeping isolation of deep space.  The universe offered limitless wonder, but also a stark reminder of humanity's fragile place within its grandeur.
