
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the worn, leather-bound journal detailing her quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the unknown.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already taken years, a constant dance with unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  Their hyperdrive hummed a steady, reassuring rhythm against the vast, silent expanse of space, the risks immeasurable but the potential rewards – a breakthrough that would change interstellar civilization forever – made the perilous voyage worthwhile.
