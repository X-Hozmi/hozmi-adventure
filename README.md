
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of the legendary, spurred him ever forward, a lone adventurer against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The cosmos held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares threatening to fry her ship's systems, and the ever-present uncertainty of encountering unknown alien life.  But the boundless expanse of space, the potential for discovery, and the unwavering spirit of exploration burned brighter than any star, driving Eva and her crew ever deeper into the uncharted reaches of the universe.
