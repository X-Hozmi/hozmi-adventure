
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a collection of rare herbs, each painstakingly gathered for a famed apothecary in Avignon.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, the threat of plague hangs heavy in the air, and every creaking wagon wheel represents a potential delay in her perilous journey. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the challenge of the road, fuels her onward, a solitary adventurer against the vast, unpredictable backdrop of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos presents its own dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions vying for the same precious resource.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the tantalizing promise of discovery outweigh the risks, driving Captain Jax and her crew further into the uncharted regions of the galaxy.
