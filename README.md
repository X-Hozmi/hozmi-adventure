
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her horse onward.  The King's decree – to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Oakhaven – burned in her mind, a fiery counterpoint to the icy chill.  Robbers, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the fractured kingdom.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fragile hope of survival, as she pushed ever closer to her destination, a lone woman against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Rylo' Rylander piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unknown dangers, including rogue gravitational wells and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic wonders and lurking threats, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys.  Yet, Rylo, like Elara before him, pressed on, driven by a purpose that transcended the immense physical distances, fueled by a thirst for discovery that burns eternally in the human spirit.
