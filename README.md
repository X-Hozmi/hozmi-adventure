
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork of creaking wagons and weary horses, lumbers across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the unrest in our hearts.  We’re bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic.  Each day brings fresh challenges: bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to etch our names in legend, spurs us onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Stardust Wanderer* cuts through the inky void, hurtling towards Kepler-186f.  This isn't a journey measured in days or weeks, but in years, punctuated by the hypnotic dance of nebulae and the chilling vastness of interstellar space. Our mission: to establish a colony on a potentially habitable world, a testament to humanity's relentless drive for expansion. The dangers are less tangible than bandits or starvation, but far more profound: radiation storms, equipment failure, and the ever-present loneliness of space.  But the promise of a new dawn, a new home amongst the stars, fuels our courage.
