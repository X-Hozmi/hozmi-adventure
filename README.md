
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Kaelan's small company pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Shrine of Aethelred, had already claimed several men to sickness and exhaustion.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of the shrine's healing powers, and the glory that awaited those who returned, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump between galaxies had been harrowing, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits.  Now, navigating the asteroid field surrounding the planet proved equally challenging.   Eva, though weary, held firm. The fate of thousands rested on her shoulders, a far cry from the personal quest of a medieval knight, but a burden nonetheless weighty with the hopes and dreams of a burgeoning interstellar civilization.
