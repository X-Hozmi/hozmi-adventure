
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of the Whispering Woods, where rumors of goblins and worse things lurked.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits demanding toll, crumbling bridges threatening to send them to their watery graves, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the holy shrine, and the whispered promise of healing, spurred them on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic radiation and unpredictable asteroid fields, while the ship's aging hyperdrive threatened to fail at any moment.  The vast emptiness of space, the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, and the constant hum of the ship's engines provided a stark contrast to the dangers she faced.  The success of her mission rested on her skill and courage; the lives of countless colonists depended on her reaching her destination.
