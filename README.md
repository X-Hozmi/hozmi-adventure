
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights crested the hill, the setting sun painting the sprawling, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their mission: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a sacred relic, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in a fairy tale.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating by the stars to bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages. Their adventure was a test of endurance, loyalty, and unwavering faith.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum as it leaped across the void between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the colonized sectors, were on a quest to locate a lost colony, rumored to have stumbled upon a source of near-limitless energy. The journey was less about physical hardship and more about the psychological toll of endless starlight, the constant threat of cosmic anomalies, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unimaginable riches, and the hope of finding lost kin propelled them onwards, through nebulae and asteroid fields, towards the unknown.
