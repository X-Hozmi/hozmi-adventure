
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection against the biting wind.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and magic.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, a determined glint in her eye despite the hardships. This journey, fraught with peril, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar unity.  Across light-years, through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, the *Starseeker* cut a path, a tiny vessel against the immense backdrop of the cosmos.  The journey was not merely a voyage through space, but a voyage into the unknown future of humanity.
