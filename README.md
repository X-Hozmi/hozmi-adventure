
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  The King's decree, a fool's errand some called it, tasked her with reaching the far-flung monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Survival, not glory, fueled her onward, the distant monastery a shimmering mirage in the harsh landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders, Ryla and her crew faced challenges far removed from medieval hardships, yet equally perilous.  The vastness of space, a canvas of cosmic wonder and existential dread, tested their courage and their ship's integrity with every jump to hyperspace.
