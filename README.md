
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on his worn leather armor.  His journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed passes, treacherous terrain threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling into oblivion, and the biting wind offered little respite. Yet, the promise of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to lie hidden in a forgotten monastery beyond the peaks, fueled his relentless pursuit.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath, was a step closer to legend, or perhaps, to a swift and brutal end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from her home in the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate vessels that patrolled these uncharted sectors required nerves of steel and impeccable piloting skills.  The vast, cold emptiness of space contrasted starkly with the vibrant, alien landscapes she encountered – a testament to the breathtaking scale and infinite possibilities of interstellar travel, and the constant danger it entailed.
