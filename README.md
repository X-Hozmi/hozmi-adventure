
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already tested their mettle against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording raging rivers, navigating dense forests haunted by whispers of mythical beasts, and the constant gnawing anxiety of the unknown that lay ahead.  Their reward, they hoped, would be more than just spiritual salvation; it was the chance to prove their courage and forge legends whispered around campfires for generations to come.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a tapestry of cosmic wonders and perilous encounters – navigating asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize her ship, evading the gravity wells of rogue planets, and engaging in tense standoffs with rival explorers.  The vast emptiness of space, however, was a far greater adversary than any pirate or monster, the relentless solitude a test of her spirit as demanding as any medieval quest.
