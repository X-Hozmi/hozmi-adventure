
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his gut.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained muscle, fueled his resolve.  He'd faced bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless plains, yet the unwavering promise of Eldoria spurred him onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness pressing against their ship's hull.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown celestial phenomena made every jump through hyperspace a breathtaking gamble – a different kind of adventure, but just as perilous and exhilarating as any medieval journey.
