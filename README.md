
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to a distant castle besieged by rebels.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of the surrounding forest, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease. His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting moments of camaraderie at roadside taverns, and the constant gnawing fear of failure.  The reward, should he succeed, was a king's gratitude; the alternative, a nameless grave under an unforgiving sky.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringe of known space, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  The vastness of the galaxy pressed in on her, the loneliness a palpable weight against the hum of the engines.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each unexplored planet a potential hazard – hostile alien life, gravitational anomalies, or the insidious decay of her aging vessel.  Success meant the survival of a people; failure, oblivion swallowed by the infinite dark.
