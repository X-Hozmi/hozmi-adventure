
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered promises of a miracle cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the relentless sun threatened to claim her before she reached her destination.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of fear through her, but the hope of healing spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Starfall' Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was perilous, a gamble against unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.   Unlike Elara's earthly journey, Ryla’s voyage was measured in light-years, not miles, and the dangers were alien and incomprehensible – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling emptiness of space itself.  But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped galaxies and uncovering lost civilizations, fueled her courage, a burning star against the vast, indifferent night.
