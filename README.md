
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy City, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Days bled into weeks of relentless travel, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering faith in their hearts spurred them across the rugged terrain, each mile a testament to their endurance and the allure of the unknown that lay beyond the horizon.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet of Kepler-186f.  The journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy was a testament to human ingenuity, a dance with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  But the thrill of discovery, the potential to unlock new technologies and expand human understanding of the universe, outweighed the inherent dangers, pushing Captain Rostova and her crew further into the unmapped cosmos.
