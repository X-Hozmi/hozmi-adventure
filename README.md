
The year is 1347.  Our band of travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-caked tracks of the French countryside.  Each dawn brought the promise of peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the unpredictable wrath of nature, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Our quest? To reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a powerful artifact capable of healing the plague ravaging Europe.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the undergrowth, held its breath – a testament to the constant uncertainty that defined medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Our mission: to locate a mythical energy source on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in Earth time.  Unlike the medieval travelers, our dangers were not bandits and disease, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failure – a malfunction in hyperspace could mean oblivion.
