
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, a young cartographer, urged his weary mule onward. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and monasteries.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of the unknown, the chance to chart unmapped territories and add to the world's knowledge, fueled his relentless journey.  The rough-spun map in his saddlebag, filled with hopeful speculation and frustrating blanks, was his only compass in this vast, unpredictable landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The galaxy stretched before her, a breathtaking tapestry of vibrant nebulas and distant star clusters, but also a place of unimaginable dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failures.  Yet, the vastness of space held the same allure as the medieval plains, a promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and charting a course into the unexplored expanse of the cosmos.
