
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her journey, transforming every hardship into another step closer to her goal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Khan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, a canvas of glittering stars and swirling cosmic dust, held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable wonders, pushing Nova and her crew to the limits of their courage and ingenuity as they raced against time to find the missing colonists.
