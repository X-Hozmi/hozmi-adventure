
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the spires of Avignon a distant shimmer in the afternoon sun.  Her journey from the frozen north has been brutal; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies have tested her resilience.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new opportunity to prove her worth – to deliver the sacred relic to the Pope before the encroaching plague claims more lives. The whispers of ancient prophecies and the weight of her responsibility fuel her onward, a lone figure against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby as she charts a course towards Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Her mission: to establish a new colony and secure resources for a dwindling humanity.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the boundless possibilities of exploration.  Each jump through hyperspace holds the promise of discovery, but also the ever-present threat of the unknown.
