
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword dulled, spurred his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest had tested him to his limits; bandits, storms, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions.  Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical city of Ys, glittering with gold and ancient magic, fueled his relentless march.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new opportunity to prove his courage and claim his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next breakthrough.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes was a daily routine.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  The potential reward, however, outweighed the risks, pushing Eva and her crew to explore the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
