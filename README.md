
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue plodded across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in desolate villages, and constantly watching their backs against the unpredictable violence of the era.  Yet, the allure of the sacred city, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at faster-than-light speeds.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the dazzling beauty of celestial wonders, held a different kind of peril.  Uncharted gravitational anomalies threatened to crush their ship, hostile alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel tested the crew's resilience.  But the promise of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, fueled their unwavering determination.
