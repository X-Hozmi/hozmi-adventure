
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, and the treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – navigating confusing forests, bartering for scarce provisions in isolated villages, and battling the ever-present threat of illness and starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her relentless progress.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and potentially teeming with undiscovered civilizations.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes required precision and courage.  The solitude of interstellar space, punctuated only by the hum of the ship and the crackle of the comms system, was a constant companion.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of groundbreaking discoveries, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweighed the inherent risks.
