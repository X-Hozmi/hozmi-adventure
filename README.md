
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-dusted plains, a stark contrast to the bustling marketplace I'd left behind weeks ago.  My quest, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery nestled in the heart of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, felt more desperate with each passing mile. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the whisper of ancient wisdom promised at the monastery's gate fueled my determination.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the infinite black.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, a blur of spacetime compression, had already taken us past nebulae of breathtaking beauty and through asteroid fields that tested the ship's shields to their limits. The crew, a diverse band of explorers bound by shared ambition and the thirst for discovery, remained vigilant, their eyes scanning the cosmos for any sign of the legendary Xylos civilization, rumored to possess knowledge surpassing even our own advanced understanding of the universe.  The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, yet promised untold wonders.
