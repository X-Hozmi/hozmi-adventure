
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the secret to curing her brother's plague.  Each winding mountain pass, each treacherous river crossing, was a gamble, a test of her will and resilience. Bandits lurked in the shadows, and hunger gnawed at her belly, but the hope of Ys fuelled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Raxon steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling space pirates were commonplace hazards, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of their isolation.  Yet, the possibility of finding survivors, of uncovering the mystery behind the colony's disappearance, pushed him and his crew ever further into the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
