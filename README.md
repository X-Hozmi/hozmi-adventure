
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of bandits or worse.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered directions, was her only guide towards the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fuelled by legend and the desperate hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother.  The biting wind and the gnawing hunger were secondary to the fierce determination burning within her.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across galaxies, fraught with the dangers of unknown space anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Elara, Ava had advanced technology at her fingertips, yet the daunting scale of the cosmos and the uncertainty of her destination sparked a similar thrill of intrepid exploration.
