
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve daily.  But the lure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown spurred her onwards, each sunrise a promise of new adventure and danger.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unknown celestial bodies was a constant challenge, a dance between precision and instinct.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the potential for groundbreaking discovery outweighed any risk.  The unknown beckoned, and Eva, like countless adventurers before her, answered its call.
