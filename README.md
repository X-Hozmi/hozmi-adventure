
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest to find a lost family heirloom, had taken her through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains swarming with bandits, and into the hushed reverence of ancient monasteries. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating confusing forests, bartering for supplies in unfamiliar dialects, and constantly watching for signs of danger in the lawless lands between kingdoms.  Survival depended on her wits, her courage, and the unwavering loyalty of her loyal steed.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel, was a perilous one.  Wormholes spat them out into unpredictable solar systems, asteroid fields threatened to obliterate them, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks loomed. But Ryla, a seasoned explorer hardened by years of galactic voyages, held steadfast.  The allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, fuelled her relentless drive across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
