
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery; bandits, wild animals, and the vast, unknown wilderness itself were constant companions on her treacherous journey.  The path was fraught with hardship, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, Ryla and her crew faced cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely and dangerous expanse, demanding constant vigilance and unwavering courage.  The reward, however, was the potential to rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.
