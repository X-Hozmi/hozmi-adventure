
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onwards.  The rough track wound through a landscape of sun-baked hills and shadowed forests, each bend promising either bandit ambush or the solace of a rare wayside inn.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of his perilous journey, a tapestry woven with the threads of hope and fear, hardship and unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable stellar winds, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the void.  Unlike Sir Reginald, Eva faced a different kind of adversary – the vast, unknowable expanse of space itself, its dangers both tangible and cosmic. Yet, the promise of discovery fueled her onward, the thrill of exploration echoing the age-old human spirit of adventure.
