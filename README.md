
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he crested the hill, the sun glinting off his chainmail.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken him across blistered plains, through dense, bandit-ridden forests, and over treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brought new challenges: foraging for food, navigating by the stars, and constantly remaining vigilant against both the elements and the lurking dangers of a lawless land. The whispered tales of mythical beasts and forgotten ruins only fueled his adventurous spirit, pushing him further towards his holy goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the threat of decompression were all in a day's work.  But the breathtaking views of alien planets, the discovery of new life forms, and the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweighed any risk.
