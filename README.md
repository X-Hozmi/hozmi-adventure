
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the sickness itself.  His journey was a gamble against time, a desperate race across a continent teeming with peril and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a rogue gravitational anomaly decades ago.  Navigation through uncharted space, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes, demanded skill and unwavering courage.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her adventure and the fragility of human life against its backdrop.
