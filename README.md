
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the encroaching war.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represents, spurs him onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presents challenges unlike any faced by Sir Kaelan, but the human spirit of exploration, the need to reach out and connect, remains a constant across the ages.
