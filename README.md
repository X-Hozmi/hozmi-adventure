
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He journeyed alongside a grizzled veteran knight, a shrewd merchant seeking exotic spices, and a mysterious woman with eyes that held the wisdom of ages, their disparate goals united by the lure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with promise and peril.  Warp drives hummed, starlight painted vibrant streaks across the cockpit, as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the opportunistic raids of space pirates.  The vastness of the cosmos, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, dwarfed even her seasoned experience,  a reminder of the unimaginable distances and dangers inherent in galactic trade.
