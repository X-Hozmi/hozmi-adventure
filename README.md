
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with salted meat and meager coin, urged his weary horse onward.  He sought the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden amidst the unforgiving sands of the Sahara.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of dehydration, and the ever-present shadow of the vast, unknown desert.  Yet, the lure of untold riches and the whispered promise of a forgotten civilization spurred him on, a solitary figure against the immensity of the landscape.

Centuries later, Elara's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The familiar hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the breathtaking vista of swirling nebulae and distant, uncharted star systems. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different – unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels – but the thrill of exploration, the siren call of the unknown, remained as potent as it was in Thomas's time.
