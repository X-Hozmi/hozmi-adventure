
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn boots pounded the cobblestones, leaving the bustling port town of Marseille behind.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, lawless lands ruled by warring barons, and the ever-present threat of bandits and disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, as he pressed onward, guided only by a tattered map and the burning hope of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, presumed destroyed by a rogue black hole.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the complex political landscape of the Galactic Federation, Eva relied on her advanced AI, her trusty crew, and her unwavering belief in the possibility of survival against unimaginable odds.  The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable peril,  a journey demanding not only skill, but also an unyielding spirit.
