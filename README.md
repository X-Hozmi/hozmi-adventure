
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the harsh, unforgiving plains of Aquitaine was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry she'd heard as a child.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, said to hold ancient knowledge, spurred her onward, the thought of discovery a powerful antidote to the gnawing fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, his ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation through the chaotic nebula was perilous, a dance between asteroid fields and unpredictable gravitational pulls.  The mission, a desperate search for a habitable planet for a dying colony, pushed him and his crew to their limits.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent, held the promise of salvation, or utter annihilation, a gamble worth taking for the sake of survival.
