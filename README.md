
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragossa, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the Inquisition's hounds, hot on her trail for daring to practice forbidden arts.  Survival hinged on her wit, her resilience, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: a perilous search for the mythical Xylos Cluster, said to contain a source of energy capable of powering entire civilizations.  Navigating treacherous nebulae, outsmarting space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all in a day's work.  But the greatest danger lay in the unknown, the vast and silent expanse of space holding secrets both wondrous and terrifying.
