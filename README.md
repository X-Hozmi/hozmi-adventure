
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, the ever-present threat of disease in crowded towns, and the unpredictable whims of weather were all constant companions. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in a long and arduous race against time and the unforgiving elements.  He sought not gold, but knowledge, a rumored scroll detailing ancient magic said to reside in the Byzantine capital.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll Empire, whose territorial claims stretched across several galaxies, demanded unwavering skill and nerves of steel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held wonders beyond imagining, but also unimaginable dangers.  The reward, however, was the promise of discovery, of charting unknown territories and pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
