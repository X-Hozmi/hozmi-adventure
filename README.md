
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of St. Elara, had been fraught with peril. Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested their mettle.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, foraging for food, and constantly scanning the horizon for potential enemies.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, was a constant reminder of their insignificance against the elements and the capriciousness of fate.

Centuries later, in the year 2742, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating hyperspace was a delicate dance between calculation and instinct, a constant battle against gravitational forces and unpredictable energy surges. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of awe – the breathtaking beauty of alien star systems, the silent majesty of nebulae, and the chilling emptiness of the void between worlds.  The greatest danger wasn’t the unknown, but the very real possibility that Kepler-186f, and its inhabitants, might be lost forever.
