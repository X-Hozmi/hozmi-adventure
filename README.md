
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of York, a packhorse laden with meager supplies our only companion.  Ahead lay the treacherous, bandit-ridden roads to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Each sunrise brought the threat of starvation, disease, or worse – a band of mercenaries seeking to relieve us of our few possessions.  The vastness of the continent stretched before us, a tapestry of forests, mountains, and unforgiving plains, each mile a testament to our resilience and the unwavering faith that spurred us onward.

Conversely, imagine piloting the 'Stardust Drifter' in 2742.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years away.  The hyperspace jump was a blur of impossible colours and disorienting g-forces, the ship's AI our only guide through the cosmic labyrinth.  Instead of bandits, we faced the silent threat of stellar flares and rogue asteroids, the infinite expanse of space a humbling reminder of humanity's insignificance, yet our technological prowess its defiant answer.  The journey, though vastly different, carried the same exhilarating blend of risk and reward.
