
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the King across the treacherous mountain passes, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the biting winds threatened to sweep her from the narrow paths.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a potent mix of fear and determination fueling her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates were daily occurrences, the vast, unknowable expanse of space a constant challenge. Yet, the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, burned brighter than any star in the inky blackness.
