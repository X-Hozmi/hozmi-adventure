Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small prices to pay for the chance to uncover its secrets.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held an allure that dwarfed even the grandest medieval quests, the promise of discovery and the potential for unimaginable wonders driving her onward.
