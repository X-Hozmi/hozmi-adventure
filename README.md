
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and skill, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any man.  Yet, with each sunrise, the promise of exotic silks, bustling markets, and untold riches fueled her onward, a fire burning brighter than the flickering campfire that offered nightly solace.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching at the breathtaking spectacle of a thousand burning suns.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders operating in the fringes of known space.  Advanced technology offered a semblance of safety, but the vastness of the cosmos, the isolating loneliness of interstellar travel, and the sheer unpredictability of the unknown kept Eva's heart pounding with a thrilling mix of fear and exhilaration.
