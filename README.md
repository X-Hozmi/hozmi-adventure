
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, guiding him toward the mythical city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or danger.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles between him and his quest for fortune and glory.  The vastness of the medieval world, a tapestry woven with peril and possibility, lay before him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and filled with the unknown.  Her crew, a diverse band of scientists and explorers, faced challenges far beyond Thomas's: navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering alien languages, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile extraterrestrial life.  The cosmos, an infinite expanse of wonder and danger, was their medieval plains, but on a scale utterly beyond human comprehension.
