
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a brittle scroll containing a rumored map to the lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones among traveling merchants.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of potential discovery—and the chilling possibility of ambush.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were companions on her arduous journey, testing her resilience with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-like planet light-years from her home in the Sol system.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns—uncharted asteroid fields, volatile wormholes, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  But the promise of discovering new civilizations and charting unmapped territories fueled her relentless pursuit, echoing the spirit of adventure that had driven explorers for millennia.
