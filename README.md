
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable spring floods, and the ever-present threat of illness shadowed their every step.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their endurance and loyalty, forging a bond stronger than any forged in the fires of battle. The vast, uncharted landscapes stretched before them, promising both hardship and the potential for untold discovery.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway. Captain Lyra, aboard the 'Stardust Wanderer', charted a course through the Cygnus X-1 nebula.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known galaxies, faced dangers far exceeding those of any medieval quest.  Warp storms threatened to tear their ship apart, alien lifeforms both beautiful and terrifying populated uncharted planets, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive strained their minds and bodies.  Their mission, to locate a legendary lost civilization, demanded courage, ingenuity, and a willingness to venture into the unfathomable depths of space.
