
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her weathered face.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold ancient wisdom – a journey fraught with peril, traversing bandit-ridden forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for life, or for death.  The road ahead was uncertain, but the lure of the unknown propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a remote planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring thrum against the vast, inky blackness punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, were equally driven by the promise of discovery and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown dangers - from hostile alien lifeforms to unforeseen cosmic anomalies. The universe, a boundless frontier, beckoned them forward.
