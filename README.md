
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track.  Her caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travellers, snaked its way across the unforgiving plains.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death. Yet, with every hardship, Elara's resolve hardened.  She was bound for the legendary city of Samarkand, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones, its riches and wonders a beacon against the bleak landscape. This journey, fraught with peril, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  His mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and establish a trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Sol Federation. Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unknowns of uncharted space were not.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for unforeseen gravitational anomalies, hostile alien encounters, or catastrophic engine failure.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries into the vast unknown, fuelled his every action.
