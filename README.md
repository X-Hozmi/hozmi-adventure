
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and hurried scribbles, offered little comfort against the looming uncertainties.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered of potential danger – bandits, starvation, or the brutal realities of a world where a day's journey could mean the difference between life and death.  This pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was not for the faint of heart, but the promise of redemption fueled her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Jax hurled his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The hyperdrive hummed a lullaby of unimaginable speed, a stark contrast to the breathtaking panorama of swirling nebulae and distant galaxies visible through the cockpit's viewport.  This was no medieval pilgrimage; this was a quest for the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next evolutionary leap.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned just as brightly.
