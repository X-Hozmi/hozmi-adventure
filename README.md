
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the looming, snow-capped peaks.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, sent a shiver down her spine, a testament to the raw, untamed power of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the hyperspace jump.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising lucrative mining opportunities, but also rumored to harbor hostile indigenous lifeforms.  The galaxy held endless wonders, but also countless dangers - asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  Unlike Elara's journey across a single continent, Rexx navigated the vast cosmic ocean, a landscape of unimaginable scale and breathtaking beauty, but one that demanded unwavering courage and technological prowess.
