
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the vast, untamed lands of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of the plague hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Avalon, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward, each hardship strengthening her resolve.  The road was long, the challenges relentless, but the promise of adventure burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the 'Stardust Wanderer'.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Hegemony demanded constant vigilance and split-second decisions.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the crew's courage and skill, pushing them to the limits of human endurance. The galaxy, however, held countless wonders and unspeakable dangers, and Jax knew their journey was only just beginning.
