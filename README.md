
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  His journey had already taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and past villages ravaged by plague. Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of starvation or ambush, yet the lure of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the fog of his uncertain future, pushed him relentlessly forward.  Every ache in his body, every drop of sweat, was a testament to his relentless pursuit of the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Elara's ears as they jumped to warp speed. The swirling nebula outside her viewport was a breathtaking spectacle, a vibrant tapestry of colours unlike anything found on Earth.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a perilous journey across light-years. The risks were immense; pirates, hostile alien life forms, and the ever-present threat of system malfunction, all loomed large.  Yet, Elara felt an exhilarating thrill; the vastness of space mirrored the immensity of her spirit, and the adventure was worth any price.
