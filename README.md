
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack-mules strained against the relentless climb, the wind whipping at their worn cloaks.  Their journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed passes, icy rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic, spurred them onward. Each creak of saddle leather, each labored breath, was a step closer to the adventure that might make them rich, or leave them bones bleaching in the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source on the distant planet of Aethel, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolutionary leap.  The vast expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas of celestial wonders, but also the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  The adventure lay not only in the destination, but in the countless risks and marvels encountered in the perilous voyage across the galaxy.
