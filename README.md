
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary horse onward. The sun beat down on the endless expanse of the French countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth a poor substitute for the sea air she craved. Her quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across a land both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of healing fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star. The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent majesty of celestial bodies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with danger, the possibility of encountering hostile alien vessels a constant concern.  But the knowledge that her cargo could save lives, could build a future among the stars, propelled her onward, through the inky black towards the promise of a new dawn.
