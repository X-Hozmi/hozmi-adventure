
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse grasses, held the potential for adventure – a chance encounter with bandits, a whispered rumour of a hidden monastery, or the discovery of a forgotten Roman road leading to untold riches.  The journey was perilous, the nights cold, but the lure of the unknown, the promise of a life beyond the confines of her village, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Ahead lay the uncharted Andromeda galaxy, a tapestry of vibrant colours and unimaginable wonders.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the void, but the potential rewards – new planets to explore, alien civilizations to encounter, and ancient secrets waiting to be uncovered – outweighed the risks.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, shared a common thirst for the unknown, their hearts beating in rhythm with the hum of the ship's powerful engines.
