
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, press onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the constant gnawing threat of starvation have tested their resolve. Yet, each sunrise brings with it the promise of new lands and the chance to witness the wonders – and horrors – that lie beyond their familiar borders.  Their adventure isn't just about reaching their destination, it’s about the forging of their own destinies amidst the unpredictable tapestry of medieval life.

Conversely, centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy. Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere encircling a distant star, a feat that would revolutionize interstellar travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, and facing the unknown dangers of alien civilizations, Eva and her crew face a different, but equally perilous, journey. The vastness of space presents a challenge far beyond the limitations of medieval travel, offering a breathtaking, cosmic scale to their adventure, but with the same daunting sense of isolation and the thrilling possibility of discovery.
