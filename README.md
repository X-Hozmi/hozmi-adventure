
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the rough terrain tested her endurance daily, and the whispers of mythical beasts lurking in the shadowed forests kept her ever vigilant.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a small victory in her arduous trek across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile, metallic interior.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, mapping new planetary systems and searching for habitable worlds.  The vast distances and unpredictable cosmic phenomena were formidable opponents, but the promise of discovery fueled her and her crew, pushing them further into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
