
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork of weary horses and even wearier men, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the unease in our hearts as we push deeper into the Saracen lands.  Rumors of mythical cities shimmering with gold and guarded by djinn fill our nights, a potent brew of hope and fear fueling our onward journey despite the ever-present threat of bandits, disease, and the unforgiving terrain.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a desperate hope for survival.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the Orion Arm, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or pirate attacks.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of legend lost to the annals of galactic history. The vastness of space is a terrifying and beautiful canvas, filled with nebulae that paint the darkness with vibrant hues and the promise – or perhaps the threat – of untold wonders beyond our current comprehension.
