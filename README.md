
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mire.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World, a treacherous mountain range rumored to be haunted by goblins and worse.  Her quest, to deliver the sacred relic to the monastery in the distant valley, felt less like a pilgrimage and more a desperate gamble against the elements and the shadowy figures that lurked in the deepening twilight.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the growing sense of peril.  Survival depended on her wits, her courage, and a healthy dose of luck.

Their destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery at the edge of the known galaxy.  The journey, a perilous warp-speed transit through treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted nebulae, had already tested the ship's hull and the crew's nerves.  But the promise of Xylos’s legendary energy source, and the untold riches it held, fueled their intrepid mission. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the immense risks and potential rewards of their interstellar voyage.
