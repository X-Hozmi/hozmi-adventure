
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, her worn leather jerkin offering little respite from the relentless sun.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine holding a relic of immense power, fueled her onward despite the perils.  The vast, unknown expanse stretched before her, a tapestry woven with both beauty and brutal hardship, a testament to the courage and resilience required to survive a medieval journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the Althea shuddering as it jumped into hyperspace.  Stars blurred into streaks of incandescent light, the familiar Milky Way galaxy giving way to the uncharted territories of the Andromeda Galaxy.  His mission: to locate a lost colony, scattered across the nebulae after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Rexx's challenges were not of terrain but of cosmic forces, alien threats, and the vast, unknowable distances between celestial bodies. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, burned just as fiercely in his heart.
