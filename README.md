
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin stained with the mud of a thousand miles, spurred his weary horse onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier on his quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  Beyond the viewport, a swirling nebula painted the void in hues unseen on any Earthly canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the thrill of discovery, the yearning to push the boundaries of the known, remained a powerful and persistent force, echoing the spirit of countless adventurers before her.
