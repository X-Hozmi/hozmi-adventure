
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a tyrannical lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the scrub, held a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the ever-present hunger.  Yet, with every sun-drenched mile, her resolve hardened, spurred on by the promise of a distant, more prosperous land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, lightyears from the crowded, resource-depleted Earth.  The journey was a symphony of star-crossed navigation and the hum of the hyperdrive, punctuated by the occasional asteroid shower – a far cry from medieval bandits, but just as perilous.  The vastness of space instilled a different kind of fear, a humbling reminder of humanity's fragile place within the cosmos, yet also a potent fuel for her relentless pursuit of a new beginning.
