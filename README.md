
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another league traversed towards his desperate hope.  The journey was a brutal tapestry woven with hardship, resilience, and the unwavering loyalty of his loyal hound, Fang.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, 'Hope's Embrace', lost somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling rogue space pirates, and contending with the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies were commonplace.  Each jump to a new star system was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the vast, indifferent cosmos. Yet, the thought of the potential survivors spurred her on, their hope mirrored in her own unwavering determination.
