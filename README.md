His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of facing each hardship head-on, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.

Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.

The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling brilliance of distant galaxies, held a different kind of fear than Thomas had known, a cold, cosmic loneliness that threatened to swallow her whole. But the promise of discovery, and the lives depending on her successful delivery, spurred her onward.
