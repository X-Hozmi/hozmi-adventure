
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the rumored city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and whispers of monstrous creatures haunted the lonely passes. Yet, the promise of Eldoria's legendary healing spring, and the chance to escape a life of grinding poverty, spurred her onward, each step a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  Facing the unpredictable gravitational pulls of nascent star systems and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Ryla’s crew navigated through cosmic storms and unmapped wormholes.  The quest for new habitable worlds, and the thrill of pushing humanity’s boundaries into the uncharted cosmos, fueled their relentless exploration, each jump a leap into the unknown.
