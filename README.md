
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Francia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager supplies; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a sacred relic to a distant abbey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – a chilling encounter with the plague that stalked the land.  Her journey was a gamble against the odds, a test of courage and resilience against the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and establish contact, a journey spanning lightyears and countless treacherous asteroid fields.  Advanced technology offered a measure of safety, but the vastness of space held its own perils – rogue gravitational pulls, unforeseen solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her adventure wasn't one of mud and bandits, but of cosmic radiation and the unyielding loneliness of interstellar travel.
