
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous highlands of Scotland was far from the gilded tales spun in castle halls.  Each day brought new challenges – fording icy streams, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and evading the unwelcome attention of bandits. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of adventure clinging to the wind, fueled her onward toward the mythical Isle of Skye, where she sought a cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later,  Jaxx piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas swirling around his ship like a cosmic ocean. His mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with perils – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of space pirates. But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, and the knowledge that his cargo held the key to survival for countless colonists, made the danger worthwhile.
