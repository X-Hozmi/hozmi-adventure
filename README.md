
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their weary packhorses crested the windswept hill, the vast, untamed landscape of the Scottish Highlands stretching before them.  Their quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Cuthbert from the treacherous MacGregor clan.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous bogs, raiding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glint of the sacred chalice in their minds, and the promise of glory upon their return, spurred them onward through the perilous wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next evolution.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies tested her skills and courage to their limits.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful void, held both unimaginable danger and the potential for unimaginable reward.
