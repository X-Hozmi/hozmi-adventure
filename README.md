
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the desert itself, a capricious mistress, threatened dehydration and death.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger.  Her destination, however, fuelled her weary spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the journey between galaxies was far from serene.  Uncharted asteroid fields posed constant threats, and the unpredictable behaviour of wormholes demanded precise calculations and nerves of steel.  His mission, a daring expedition to locate a mythical lost colony, tested not only his piloting skills but his resilience in the face of the vast, unknowable universe.
