
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking bridge, each shadowed forest path, held the promise of both peril and discovery. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the unwavering hope of healing fueled her steps.

Centuries later,  Captain Rexx "Razor" Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown alien lifeforms were all in a day's work for Razor.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, a tapestry of breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, promised untold riches – but only for those brave enough to reach for the stars.
