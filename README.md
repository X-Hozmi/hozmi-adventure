
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys,  storms threatened to sweep her from precarious cliff paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the whispers of a lost city, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, each hardship merely another step closer to her ultimate goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm only slightly faster than the ship's hyperdrive.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory K'tharr warships was a daily struggle, but the lure of the unexplored Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet brimming with a rare energy source, was too tempting to resist. The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers, but Rexa, like Elara before her, was driven by a thirst for discovery that burned brighter than any star.
