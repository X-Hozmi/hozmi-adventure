
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Fiacre, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and frost clung to their breath, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, a new opportunity to witness the untamed beauty of a world largely unexplored and fiercely defended.  Their destination felt a lifetime away, yet the allure of the sacred shrine, whispered about in hushed tones across the land, propelled them forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with vibrant nebulas and ancient star clusters, both awed and terrified her.  The constant hum of the hyperdrive engines, the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks were the hazards of her trade.  But the thrill of discovery, the promise of finding new worlds teeming with life or breathtaking landscapes beyond imagining, far outweighed any risk.  The final frontier beckoned, and Eva, like the countless explorers before her, answered its call.
