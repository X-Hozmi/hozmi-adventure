
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, a tattered map clutched in his gloved hand.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful artifacts.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of the legend, the whisper of glory, fuels his relentless journey across the vast and unpredictable medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a newly-colonized planet on the edge of known space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and wrestling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace are all part of a day's work. The vastness of the cosmos, however, pales in comparison to the even greater unknown: the potential for discovery and the promise of a new dawn for humanity amongst the stars.
