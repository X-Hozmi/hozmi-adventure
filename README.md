
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already claimed two men to fever and a horse to a wolf's hunger.  Each sunrise brought the promise of more hardship – bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of the distant Pyrenees, the shared stories around dwindling campfires, and the unwavering faith in their quest fueled their weary steps, transforming a grueling ordeal into a tapestry of shared adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task that required navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering ancient alien signals, and facing the unknown dangers lurking in the cosmic void.  While lacking the immediate physical hardship of Kaelan's journey, Eva's adventure demanded a different kind of resilience – the courage to confront the infinite expanse of space and the unwavering resolve to push the boundaries of human exploration, one warp jump at a time.
