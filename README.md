
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of spice and silks that fueled his journey eastward.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest for the mythical city of Zerzura was a fool's errand, some said, yet the glint of gold in his eyes betrayed a stubborn hope that burned brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to harbor sentient life.  Unlike the arduous land journeys of old, her travel was measured in light-years, the vast emptiness of space a constant companion.  Yet, the dangers remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships stalked her vessel.  The universe held its breath as she navigated the cosmic currents, seeking not gold or spices, but knowledge and the possibility of a new beginning for humanity.
