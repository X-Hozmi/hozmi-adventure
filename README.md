
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her brother, Thomas, traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their resilience, as they forged their way across the vast landscape, their faith their only true companion against the unpredictable whims of nature and the malevolence of man.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The cosmos, a breathtaking canvas of nebulae and distant suns, was both wondrous and terrifying.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in subjective time.  While technological marvels shielded them from the harsh realities of space, the unseen dangers of radiation storms and rogue asteroids constantly challenged their skill and ingenuity. The vast emptiness, paradoxically, felt more claustrophobic than any medieval forest.  Their adventure was not against bandits or disease, but the incomprehensible vastness of the universe itself.
