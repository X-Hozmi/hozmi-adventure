
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the encroaching famine.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, dense forests teeming with wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Yet, the glint of the rumored city's golden spires, glimpsed fleetingly across the horizon, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across a dozen planets within the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking involving warp jumps through uncharted space, encounters with hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of equipment failure light years from any known support.  The vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, however, was a constant source of wonder, making the risks of interstellar travel seem almost worthwhile in the pursuit of her vital mission.
