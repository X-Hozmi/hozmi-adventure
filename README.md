
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried across treacherous mountain passes and through lawless forests.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present hunger gnawing at their bellies, yet the unwavering determination in her eyes burned brighter than the midday sun, fuelled by the promise of sanctuary at the distant monastery.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engine.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, searching for habitable planets and potentially, the elusive Xylos, a sentient plant species rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space, a daunting challenge, held a different kind of danger, but the thrill of discovery fueled her journey across the cosmic ocean.
