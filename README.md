
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the breadth of Francia was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to every village. Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, with its promise of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled her relentless pursuit, each hardship a step closer to her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in the starship 'Stardust'.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space held its own brand of danger; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities tested their courage and technology.  But the thrill of discovery, the potential to find life beyond Earth, outweighed any risk for Jax and her crew, propelling them across the cosmic ocean.
