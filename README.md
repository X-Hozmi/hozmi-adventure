
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour clanking, urged his weary horse onward.  The map, a faded parchment clutched in his gauntlet, promised riches and glory in the faraway Sultanate of Delhi – a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the very air hummed with the threat of disease. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of exotic lands and untold wealth, spurred him onward, a lone knight on a perilous quest across a vast and unforgiving continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her heart a mirror of the nebulae swirling outside her viewport.  The jump to Xylos, a planet teeming with valuable crysta-lumina, was risky; subspace currents were unpredictable in this sector of the Andromeda galaxy.  While the dangers were less visceral than Sir Reginald's, the stakes were astronomically higher.  A single navigational error could mean the destruction of her ship, and with it, the lives of her crew, lost not to bandits or disease, but the cold, uncaring vastness of space itself.
