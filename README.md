
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling faintly of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be home to witches and worse.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the Duke, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, unpredictable weather turning mountain passes into death traps, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease. Each sunrise brought a renewed fight for survival, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the capricious whims of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare element vital to sustaining life on her overcrowded home planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the K'tharr Confederacy, and grappling with the unpredictable physics of warp travel, Eva faced a different kind of wilderness.  The vast expanse of space, while breathtaking, was a hostile environment demanding precision, courage, and a healthy dose of luck to ensure her safe return.
