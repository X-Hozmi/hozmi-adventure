
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the dusty track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Aethelberht, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease tested their resolve.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainties of their route, a testament to the enduring human spirit seeking solace and redemption in a world of harsh realities.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily occurrence.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held far more unknowns than any medieval journey, but the promise of a new life for humanity on a distant world fuelled her tireless pursuit across the star-strewn tapestry of the galaxy.
