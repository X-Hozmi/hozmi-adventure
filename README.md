
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, each sunset a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape and its dangers.  The allure of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, fueled his relentless march.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of solar flares were just the beginning;  unknown space anomalies and the possibility of encountering other intelligent life – possibly hostile – kept her crew on edge.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovering new worlds and expanding human knowledge, outweighed the risks. The vastness of space, while terrifying, also held a captivating beauty that fueled their intrepid journey.
