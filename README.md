
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to me like a shroud.  Each rise of the sun revealed a new vista: rolling hills giving way to craggy mountains, then vast forests teeming with unknown dangers.  My destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, lay beyond the next treacherous mountain pass, a journey fraught with bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the East, of spices and silks, of tales whispered in hushed tones around crackling fires, fueled my weary legs.

Centuries later, the stars are my guide.  My vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a shimmering path through the nebulae of Xylos, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel. Each jump takes me further from Sol, closer to the rumored Elysian Fields of Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating; the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies a constant companion to the ever-present hum of the ship's life support systems. The adventure is not just in reaching the destination but in the sheer impossible scale of the journey, a pilgrimage to the edge of known reality.
