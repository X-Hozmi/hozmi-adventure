
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traverse the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead, the promise of the fabled city of Zerzura beckons, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city of gold and untold riches.  Each step is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the shadows, wolves howl in the distance, and the biting cold threatens to steal the very life from my bones.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, keeps me moving forward, one weary step at a time.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we jump across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The starfield outside the viewport is a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, a sight that leaves me breathless even after countless jumps.  Our mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to contain a source of energy capable of solving the galaxy's looming energy crisis.  The risks are immense: pirate raids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  Yet, the potential rewards, and the breathtaking vastness of space itself, make this journey a thrilling, even necessary, undertaking.
