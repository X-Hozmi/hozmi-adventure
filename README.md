
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable whims of nature all stood between him and his desperate hope.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, but the whispered promises of Eldoria fueled his relentless pursuit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal dangers.  Faster-than-light travel offered a deceptive ease, masking the immense distances and the unpredictable hazards of navigating asteroid fields and encountering alien life forms.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each planetary landing a calculated risk, but the potential rewards outweighed the terrifying unknowns. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was also a constant reminder of her isolation and the fragile nature of her ship.
