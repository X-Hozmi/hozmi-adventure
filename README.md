
The year is 1348.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both peril and the unknown, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed landscape and the uncertain path ahead.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in her desperate race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation. Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy, their signal faint and unreliable.  The vastness of space, a constant companion, held both wonder and terror - the unpredictable jumps through hyperspace, the threat of pirate raiders, and the ever-present risk of encountering uncharted, hostile territories.  Yet, the allure of discovery fueled her journey, a relentless pursuit of humanity’s next frontier.
