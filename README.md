
Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming under the harsh midday sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Alora – led him through treacherous passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse.  Each day brought new perils, from bandits ambushing from the craggy slopes to the gnawing hunger threatening to overcome him and his small band.  Yet, the lure of glory and the promise of salvation spurred them on.

A thousand years hence, Captain Elara Rex navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy aboard the 'Stardust Drifter'. Her mission: a daring rescue mission to the ice planet Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the cosmos, but the dangers remained vast and unpredictable.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear apart the ship's hull, while alien leviathans lurked in the inky black between stars.  The crew faced not only the harsh realities of space but the ever-present threat of the Kryll, a sentient shadow-race capable of warping reality itself.  Elara and her crew were on the edge of the known universe, pushed to the limits of human endurance, but bound by a common purpose.
