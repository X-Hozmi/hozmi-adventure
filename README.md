
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding the king's missive.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes are mere inconveniences compared to the urgency of her mission: delivering the vital treaty to the embattled Duke of Castile.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for adventure, for peril, and for glory, forging a path etched in sweat, grit, and the unwavering will of a lone traveler against a vast and unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wanderer*, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae painted across the viewport are breathtaking, but the true adventure lies in the uncharted systems beyond.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony, a beacon of hope in a galaxy teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel allows for swift transit, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders makes each jump a gamble, each newly discovered planet a testament to the courage and curiosity that drives humanity's relentless expansion into the cosmos.
