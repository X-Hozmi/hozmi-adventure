
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a search for a miracle.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to establish a vital hyperspace relay station on the far side of the galaxy, a crucial step in the ongoing Intergalactic Federation expansion. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate attacks from the notorious Kryll Syndicate, and overcoming the challenges of navigating uncharted space demanded unwavering skill and courage. The vastness of space held wonders and terrors in equal measure, making each jump into hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.
