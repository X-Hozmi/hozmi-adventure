
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under a bruised twilight sky, spurred his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Black Forest, promised adventure – or death. Rumours of a lost monastery, said to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, had driven him from his ancestral lands.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow cast by the towering pines, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unseen horrors lurking in the forgotten places of the world.  His journey, a tapestry woven with sweat, fear, and the unwavering hope of glory, was far from over.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space held its own brand of terror – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to chart new territories for humanity, fueled her courage.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on the unknown, a thrilling adventure in the grand cosmic theatre.
