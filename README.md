
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her mule across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Rumors of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient texts and untold riches, draw her ever eastward. Each sunrise reveals a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Her journey is a tapestry woven with the grit of survival, the camaraderie of fellow travelers met along the way, and the unshakeable hope that fuels her relentless pursuit of the legendary scriptures.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the nebula's iridescent glow.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage fraught with unmapped gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroid fields.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, Ryla faces the weight of technological failure, the psychological strain of prolonged isolation, and the unknown wonders (and terrors) hidden within the cosmic expanse.  The galaxy is their medieval wilderness, a vast frontier demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering spirit of exploration.
