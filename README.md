
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest had been relentless, each day a battle against overgrown paths, torrential rains, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King in Paris, felt more desperate with each passing league.  He dreamt of warm hearths and ale, but the chilling wind and the rasping coughs of his companions reminded him that survival, not comfort, was the primary goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been harrowing, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and navigators, monitored the ship's systems, their faces etched with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.  The discovery of a potentially habitable planet in a distant spiral arm was a momentous task, one that required courage, skill, and an unwavering belief in the possibilities that lay beyond the known stars.
