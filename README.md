
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Reginald, his armor clanking, urged his weary mount onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the horse behind him, a tempting prize for the bandits that infested these lawless lands.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of fear through him, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead to reach the safety of the coastal city.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless nights spent huddled under a star-strewn sky, his only guide through the treacherous wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic display outside.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  But the galaxy wasn't empty, and whispers of pirate fleets and unknown space anomalies made this a voyage fraught with danger far beyond the petty squabbles of medieval kingdoms.  The vast expanse of space held its own brand of treacherous beauty.
