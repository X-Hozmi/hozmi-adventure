The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, swallowed the sounds of their small party.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.

The journey itself, a perilous dance through gravitational anomalies and asteroid fields, was as daunting a task as the colonization that awaited them.
