
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn surcoats flapping behind them.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of salvation spurred them onward, through sun-drenched valleys and treacherous mountain passes, a testament to human resilience in a harsh and unforgiving world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  The vastness of space, speckled with distant suns and the chilling emptiness between the stars, was a different kind of wilderness than Kaelan's, but no less perilous.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions tested her crew's skill and courage.  The unknown, far more vast than any medieval kingdom, beckoned them onward, to a future that was both terrifying and exhilarating.
