
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a scrabbling tapestry of creaking wagons and weary beasts, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance like mischievous sprites, mocking our slow progress.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the insidious bite of desert fever.  Yet, the whispered promise of Zerzura's untold riches, its rumored fountains of youth, fuels our relentless westward march, pushing us beyond the limits of known maps and into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel of shimmering chrome and advanced alloys, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life.  The journey is fraught with perils; unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies.  But the allure of discovering extraterrestrial life, of unraveling the grand mysteries of the cosmos, outweighs the risks a thousandfold.  We are pioneers, charting a course into the infinite expanse of the universe.
