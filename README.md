
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred on by rumors of a hidden monastery holding the lost scriptures of St. Brendan, trudged through the muddy Flemish countryside.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge: treacherous bogs swallowing our packhorses, skirmishes with bandits lurking in the shadowed forests, and the constant gnawing hunger threatening to break our resolve.

Centuries later, the stars themselves beckoned.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' her vessel a tiny speck against the breathtaking immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the swirling chaos of space-time.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the relentless pursuit of Kryll pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen – these were the daily trials of interstellar travel. The promise of untold riches on Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to immortality, fuelled their perilous journey across the cosmic void.
