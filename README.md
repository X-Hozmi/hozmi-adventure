
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a king's desperate plea – a message that must reach a faraway monastery before winter's grip closes.  Robbers, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalk her every step, but the promise of salvation, whispered on the wind, spurs her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each shift of the sun, marks another inch closer to her destiny – or her demise.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Riley navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel has shrunk the galaxy, but the perils remain: pirate fleets, treacherous wormholes, and the ever-present loneliness of deep space.  His crew, a ragtag bunch of specialists, are his only hope as he embarks on this perilous journey across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
