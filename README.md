
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the whispers of mythical creatures kept her ever vigilant. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory in this brutal, breathtaking landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson gas clouds painting their starship's hull in an ethereal glow.  His mission: to establish a trade route between the Xylos system and the Andromeda Galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was perilous, warping space-time around their vessel, but the potential rewards – access to rare minerals and alien technologies – outweighed the risks.  Across the vast, unknowable expanse of space, each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
