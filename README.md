
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's writ, a sealed scroll clutched tight in his hand, promised riches and glory in the far-off lands of the East.  He envisioned bustling markets filled with silks and spices, the gleam of gold in the Sultan's treasury, and the thrill of facing down bandits and mythical beasts along the perilous journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each distant howl of a wolf, fueled the adventure burning in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship as she navigated asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational anomalies, her crew a diverse band united by a shared thirst for discovery.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring expanse, held both unimaginable wonders and deadly dangers, a challenge worthy of her pioneering spirit.
