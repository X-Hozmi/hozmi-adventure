
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings and untold riches.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, fueled both his excitement and fear.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature all stood between him and his goal, making this journey across the unforgiving landscape a true test of endurance and will.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel-like planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of countless suns, was both exhilarating and terrifying.  Hyperdrive malfunctions, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of uncharted cosmic anomalies made every jump to warp speed a gamble – but the promise of discovery and the hope of connecting humanity across the galaxy fueled her unwavering determination.
