
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara and her companions pressed onward, their worn leather boots crunching on frozen ground.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, was proving far more arduous than the bards had sung.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, rivers swollen with the melt, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  But the gleam of gold and the promise of untold riches fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the harsh landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between stars, but the journey wasn't without peril.  Asteroids the size of mountains posed constant threats, and the unpredictable gravitational forces of black holes were a constant worry.  Yet, the thought of bringing power – and salvation – to her struggling homeworld spurred Ava onward, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
