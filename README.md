
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air. Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving hearts of men.  Every creak of the saddle, every distant hawk cry, held the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, navigating his starship 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of breathtaking cosmic beauty and terrifying unknown hazards. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  The shimmering, ethereal landscapes of alien planets were both mesmerizing and lethal, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse.  The vastness of the cosmos dwarfed human ambition, but for Rexx, the thrill of exploration fueled his relentless pursuit.
