
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the chance to discover something extraordinary, spurred him across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the dangers of the road.

Centuries later, Elara piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the occasional perilous asteroid field, was a different kind of wilderness than Thomas had known.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of cosmic landscapes, and the ever-present possibility of finding something new—something life-sustaining—fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
