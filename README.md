
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost scriptures of the Ancients, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened avalanches, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any man.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing their courage, their loyalty, and their resilience. The promise of Eldoria’s secrets, however, fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness of space, its destination a newly discovered nebula in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents was commonplace on her perilous missions. The crew faced not only the dangers of the cosmos – radiation storms, rogue planetoids, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – but also the gnawing isolation of deep space travel.  Yet, the allure of charting the unknown, of uncovering the mysteries of the universe, spurred them on, each jump to warp speed a leap of faith into the boundless, magnificent unknown.
