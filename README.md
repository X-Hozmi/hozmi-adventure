
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, guides her towards the legendary city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of untold riches and forgotten magic, fuels her relentless journey eastward.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The vast expanse of the cosmos stretches before him, a tapestry woven with twinkling constellations and shimmering gas giants. His mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Faster-than-light jumps are fraught with peril, the risk of spatial distortion a constant companion. Yet, the potential reward, a doorway to infinite possibilities, outweighs the dangers, pushing him further into the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
