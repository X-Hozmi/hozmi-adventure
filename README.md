His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of saving his kingdom.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were all obstacles in his path, but the lure of glory and the salvation of his people propelled him forward, each creak of saddle leather a promise of adventure yet to come.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.

But the boundless expanse of space, teeming with untold wonders and dangers, offered a freedom and a challenge that ignited her spirit, driving her ever further into the inky blackness.
