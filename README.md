
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and rivers swollen with spring melt. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a renewed hope for survival, fuelled by tales of Eldoria's shimmering spires and miraculous healing waters.  He rode not just for himself, but for his people.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing damage from solar flares were all in a day’s work.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, the glittering tapestry of stars a constant reminder of the unimaginable distances and the endless possibilities that lay beyond.  The fate of humanity, she knew, might rest on her shoulders and the journey ahead.
