
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered about in taverns and sung by wandering bards, was proving far more arduous than imagined.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the endless expanse of the countryside tested both his resilience and the dwindling supplies in his saddlebags. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the gnawing uncertainty of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and repairing critical systems were daily occurrences.  The vast, unknowable cosmos held wonders beyond imagining, but also unimaginable dangers, a constant reminder that even with advanced technology, the universe remains a profoundly hostile and unforgiving place.
