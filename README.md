
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in taverns, a place of untold riches and dangerous magic.  His meager supplies dwindled with each league, the gnawing hunger a constant companion to the ever-present fear of bandits and the unpredictable wild.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him – this journey was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice for a better life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*,  her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The hyperdrive hummed, a deep thrum vibrating through the ship as they jumped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space, the potential for discovery and annihilation equally balanced, fueled her with a primal energy. This was more than a voyage; it was a quest for the future of humankind.
