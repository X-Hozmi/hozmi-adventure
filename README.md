
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the muddy track.  Each step was a challenge: bandits lurked in the forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow us whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the allure of the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred us onward, promising riches beyond measure and adventures that would etch themselves onto our souls.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', her gaze fixed on the swirling nebula that marked the entrance to the Xylos system.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien races or encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies. But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds brimming with resources and wonders beyond human comprehension, made the risk a small price to pay for the ultimate galactic adventure.
