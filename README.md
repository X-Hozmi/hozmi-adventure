
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the uncharted lands whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a kingdom said to be built of silver, ruled by a sorceress.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and magic, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, breathtaking landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a trial of endurance, a dance with unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant planets and nebulas, both awed and humbled her.  But the potential discovery of a new habitable world, a new civilization, fueled her unwavering resolve, making the risks of interstellar travel worthwhile.
