
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and the weight of her family's hopes.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient mountains, and the whispers of plague stalked the travelers along the dusty roads. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her.  Reaching the distant market in Avignon meant life, but the journey was a gamble against starvation, disease, and the unpredictable nature of the wilderness.


Millennia later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Galaxies blurred past the viewport, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and deadly hazards.  The jump drive hummed, a fragile bridge between star systems, while the ship's AI monitored for asteroid fields and pirate broadcasts.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos crystals, a resource vital to the survival of her dying planet. The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and perilous, held the key to her people’s future, a gamble against the infinite odds of the universe.
