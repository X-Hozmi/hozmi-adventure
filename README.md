
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate moor, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of sun-drenched lands beyond the king's borders.  His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, a gem said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous river crossing, each hostile encounter with bandits and outlaws, only fueled his determination to reach his destination, a journey as perilous as it was promising.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission, far more ambitious than any medieval knight's, was to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades prior.  Each jump through hyperspace, each encounter with rogue asteroids and sentient space-faring creatures, brought her closer to the unknown, a journey fraught with danger but promising answers to the galaxy's greatest mystery.
