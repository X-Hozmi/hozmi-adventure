
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and whispers of the Black Death followed them like a malevolent specter.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in hostile villages, and constantly guarding against the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, despite the hardship, a thrilling sense of adventure propelled them onward, fueled by faith and the intoxicating lure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey considered suicidal by most.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a brutal mistress.  Unpredictable gravitational anomalies threatened to crush their vessel, and hostile alien patrols patrolled the void.  But Eva, fueled by her insatiable curiosity and the hope of discovering new worlds, pressed on, her crew a band of brave souls united by a shared thirst for the unimaginable wonders that lay beyond the known cosmos.
