
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy brown curtain obscuring the already fading light. Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to be haunted by vengeful spirits and riddled with bandits.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke, a journey fraught with peril, but one he must undertake if his kingdom were to survive.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, screamed of potential danger in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas unfolding outside her viewport.  Though the dangers were less tangible than bandits and mires – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, unknown alien life – the stakes were just as high.  The fate of humanity's expansion, the discovery of new worlds, rested on the success of her mission.
