
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to curing the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both danger and discovery – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions.  But the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the fringes of known galaxies after a catastrophic warp-jump failure.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – but the thrill of exploration, the relentless pursuit of a lost civilization, echoed the spirit of Elara's medieval journey.  The universe, vast and unforgiving, yet held the promise of untold wonders.
