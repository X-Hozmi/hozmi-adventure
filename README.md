
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the ancient map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the lingering desperation of the Black Death itself.  The journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against the encroaching shadow of death.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the starfield outside their ship blurring into a kaleidoscope of impossible colours.  Their mission: to traverse the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage to locate a mythical energy source capable of saving their dying planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and facing the unknown terrors lurking in the unexplored nebulae were all part of the journey. The stakes were cosmic, the reward – the survival of their species.
