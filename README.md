His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost alchemy.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing treacherous passes and hostile landscapes – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, of untold riches and arcane knowledge, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva's journey spanned light-years, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, tested her courage and skill, but the promise of unlocking humanity's interstellar future propelled her ever onward.
