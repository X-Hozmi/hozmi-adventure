
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving plains of Francia stretching before them.  Their journey to reclaim the stolen relic of Saint Michael was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for supplies in wary villages, and facing the constant gnawing fear of the unknown that lay beyond the next horizon. This was a journey not for the faint of heart, a true test of courage and endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining minerals to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was just another day's work.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet indifferent, held its own unique brand of peril; hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, and the loneliness of interstellar travel could crush the strongest spirit. But the promise of life, even across the gulf of galaxies, was a powerful motivator, fueling her onward.
