
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas and retrieve a sacred relic, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of bandit-infested forests. Each day brought new challenges – starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the allure of the legendary artifact spurred him onwards, fueled by hope and a stubborn refusal to yield.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring exploration of the uncharted Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with perils far exceeding any medieval knight’s.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, encounters with hostile alien civilizations, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction were just a few of the obstacles she faced. Yet, the boundless expanse of space, teeming with the unknown, ignited a thirst for discovery within her that overshadowed every hardship, driving her ever further into the cosmic abyss.
