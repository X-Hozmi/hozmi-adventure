
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the jagged peaks a constant reminder of the perils ahead.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a meticulously crafted map leading to the legendary Sunstone, a jewel said to hold the power of healing.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambushes or worse – the whispers of mythical beasts haunting these unforgiving lands fuelled her weary but determined spirit.  The journey was arduous, demanding both physical and mental strength, but the promise of the Sunstone, and the whispered tales of its power, kept her pushing onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the Kepler-186f system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting rhythm against the backdrop of the vast, unknowable cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, their last transmission a garbled plea for aid.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all in a day's work for Ryla. The loneliness of interstellar travel was a heavy burden, but the hope of finding survivors, of bringing them home, spurred her on across the unforgiving expanse of space.
