
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the midday sun beating down on our worn leather and chainmail.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to us, a constant reminder of the perils and pleasures of the road.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of distant lands, whispered tales of powerful mages and forgotten kingdoms, spurred us onward, our hearts pounding with the rhythm of adventure.


Millennia hence, the stars themselves were our highways.  Our vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, a marvel of intergalactic engineering, sliced through the cosmic tapestry, leaving a shimmering trail in its wake. We were explorers, charting unknown nebulae and mapping uncharted planets, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unknowable universe.  The thrill of discovery, of encountering alien life forms both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly monstrous, overshadowed the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the cold, silent vacuum of space.
