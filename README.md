
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, spurred his weary mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a fitting backdrop to his perilous quest.  He carried a cryptic scroll, its faded ink hinting at a lost relic hidden somewhere beyond the treacherous Black Forest, a journey fraught with bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast distance still separating him from his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political intrigue swirling around her mission: retrieving a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f.  Alien encounters were commonplace, ranging from helpful space-faring nomads to hostile, heavily armed pirates.   Eva's journey, while technologically advanced, was no less fraught with peril than Reginald's; the vastness of space, a far more daunting challenge than any forest, held its own unique brand of danger and uncertainty.
