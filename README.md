
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried figs and a chipped flint; it contains the King's decree, a perilous mission to broker a fragile peace with the warring Beyliks.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every league covered, Elara's resolve hardens, fueled by the hope of a lasting peace and the thrill of the unknown that lies ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa commands the starship *Stardust*.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Their journey is a symphony of calculated risks – navigating asteroid fields that shimmer like obsidian rivers, enduring weeks of hyperspace jumps that strain both their ship and their sanity, and facing the potential discovery of alien civilizations.  The vast, inky blackness of space holds both immense danger and the promise of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets, a gamble worth taking for the advancement of humankind.
