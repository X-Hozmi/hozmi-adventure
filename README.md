
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the unforgiving plains of Francia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the whispers of the Black Death chilled her more than the biting wind.  Each sunrise brought the grim possibility of starvation, or worse, a violent end. Yet, the promise of reaching the distant monastery, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, spurred her onward, a flickering ember of hope against the vast darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula's shimmering veil, the kaleidoscopic colours a breathtaking distraction from the perilous jump they'd just completed.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unknown.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading hostile alien patrols was a daily challenge, but the thrill of discovery, the potential of uncovering new life and civilizations, fueled their tireless exploration.
