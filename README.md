
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's retinue as they trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold and the hope it offered spurred them onward, through dense forests haunted by whispers of ancient magic and across rivers swollen with spring rains, a testament to human resilience in the face of hardship.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by the void centuries ago.  Faster-than-light travel was treacherous, fraught with the dangers of spatial anomalies and rogue asteroids.  But Eva, hardened by years navigating the galactic frontier, pressed on, fueled by the faintest signal detected – a whisper of survival echoing across light-years of empty space.  The fate of a forgotten people rested on her courage and skill.
