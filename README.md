Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll; the once-bright colours of his banner were now faded and dusty, mirroring the weariness in his heart.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Woods, a legendary labyrinth rumoured to be guarded by creatures both monstrous and mythical.  He spurred his weary horse onward, the clatter of hooves a fragile counterpoint to the rustling whispers that seemed to emanate from the dense foliage, his quest for the lost city of Eldoria driving him ever forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast distances she traversed.  Though the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the same thrill of exploration, the same unwavering determination to reach the unknown, burned brightly within her.
