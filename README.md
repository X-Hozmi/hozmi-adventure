
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to a potent healing balm for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis in a sea of sand, fueled his determination, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped nebula of Xylos, searching for a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and potential betrayal that lurked within her own crew.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of oblivion.
