
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey from York to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the endless expanse of unfamiliar countryside tested his resilience.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fleeting respite before the next leg of his arduous pilgrimage.  The whispered tales of exotic lands and legendary relics fueled his weary steps, a promise of reward for his perilous trek across a vast and unpredictable medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers both biological and technological.  Warp jumps across lightyears were commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace always held the potential for catastrophic failure.  Eva and her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced the infinite expanse with a blend of calculated risk and unwavering courage, driven by the promise of a future secured by their daring intergalactic expedition.
