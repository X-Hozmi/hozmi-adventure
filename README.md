
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel contained little but dried meats, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising riches in the distant kingdom of Aragon.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel. Yet, the whispered legends of Aragon's hidden city spurred her onward, a beacon in the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation glitches, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms were just a few of the perils she faced.  But the promise of discovering new life, of charting uncharted territories among the stars, fueled her insatiable thirst for exploration.
