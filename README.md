
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear clung to the air, a constant reminder of the bandit gangs that plagued the King's Road.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the long grass, was a potential threat, a test of his courage and endurance as he journeyed through a landscape both breathtaking and brutal.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula aboard the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, held a different kind of peril than Thomas had faced.  Nebula storms threatened to crush her ship, and alien lifeforms, both benevolent and malevolent, lurked in the shadows between stars.  But the lure of discovery, the hope of finding a lost civilization, pushed her ever further into the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
