
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he traverses the sun-baked plains, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind.  The King's writ, a sealed scroll clutched in his gauntlet, promises riches and glory – the recovery of a stolen relic from a distant monastery nestled high in the treacherous Serpent's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, holds the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse, the whispers of magic woven into the very fabric of the land.  His journey is a tapestry of peril and hope, a gamble against the odds and the relentless march of time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory space pirates of the Kryll Syndicate is a daily challenge.  The vast, silent expanse of space holds both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile position in the cosmic ocean.  The mission's success hinges on her skill, her courage, and the unwavering hope of finding a new home among the stars.
