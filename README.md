
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a challenge, each sunset a gamble.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of the Black Death followed them like a phantom. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, promising untold riches and adventure in the far East, spurred them onward. The sting of hunger and the threat of violence were small prices to pay for the chance to see the world beyond their village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the navigation console.  The jump to Xylos was rough, the hyperdrive sputtering like a dying beast.  His crew, a motley band of intergalactic mercenaries, stared out at the swirling nebulae painting the viewport with ethereal colors.  Their mission: to retrieve a priceless artifact from the war-torn planet below.  The risk was immense—Xylos's atmosphere was toxic, its inhabitants hostile, and pirate factions patrolled the star lanes like sharks.  But the reward – enough credits to retire on a tropical paradise – was worth risking everything, even if it meant facing the unknown dangers that lay beyond the stars.
