
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, spurred his weary steed onward.  The rough track wound through a primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous bogs swallowing unwary travelers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were child's play compared to the cosmic horrors lurking in the uncharted regions of the galaxy.  With her trusty AI, Orion, and a crew of hardened spacefarers, Eva pushed the boundaries of known space, driven by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held its own brand of terrifying isolation.
