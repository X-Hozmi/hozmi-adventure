
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the rutted track, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their meager supplies. Yet, the allure of the lost oasis, promising untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rise and fall of the terrain, was a step closer to the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted cosmic storms and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Advanced technology shielded them from the harsh vacuum of space, but the loneliness of the cosmos and the sheer scale of the unknown remained daunting.  Each jump through hyperspace, each scan of a new planet, brought both breathtaking discovery and the chilling awareness of their own insignificance in the vast, uncaring expanse of the universe.
