Ahead lay the rumored city of Zaragosa, a whispered legend of untold riches and forgotten magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, already whispering its name on the wind.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, propelled her onward, a tiny silhouette against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the dazzling beauty of celestial bodies, held both a thrilling freedom and a chilling isolation. The stakes were higher than ever - failure meant oblivion in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos; success, however, could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.
