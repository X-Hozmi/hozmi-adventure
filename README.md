
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The biting wind whipped across the vast, rolling plains of France, a stark contrast to the warmth of the hearth I’d left behind in my village.  My quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, felt less a journey of faith and more a desperate gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another day survived in this brutal, breathtaking landscape.

Centuries later, the stars are my guide.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we jump, leaving the swirling nebula of the Crab behind and hurtling towards the Andromeda galaxy.  This isn't a pilgrimage, but an expedition – a scientific foray into the uncharted territories of space, seeking habitable planets amidst the celestial tapestry.  The thrill of discovery outweighs the risk, the vastness of the cosmos a thrilling, daunting canvas awaiting our exploration.
