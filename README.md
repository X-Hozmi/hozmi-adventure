
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold secrets of unimaginable power. My trusty steed, a sturdy destrier named Comet, snorted, sensing the danger as we skirted crumbling ruins, the echoes of forgotten battles clinging to the air. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the snow, amplified the thrill and the palpable sense of lurking unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the vast, star-dusted void.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Through the viewport, nebulae swirled in breathtaking colours, a spectacle dwarfing even the most vibrant medieval tapestries. The risk of encountering unforeseen cosmic phenomena—a rogue asteroid, a gravitational anomaly—was ever-present, but the lure of discovery, the chance to chart unmapped territories among the stars, outweighed any fear. The ultimate frontier beckoned.
