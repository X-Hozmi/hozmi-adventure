
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling whispers of the Black Death itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, breathtaking beauty, and the unwavering hope for salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in years under hyperdrive.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outmaneuvering hostile pirate fleets, and coping with the psychological strain of interstellar travel were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space, both terrifying and magnificent, held its own unique set of dangers, testing her courage and resourcefulness in ways medieval knights could scarcely imagine.
