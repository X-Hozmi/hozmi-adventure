
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's ransom, a chest heavy with gold and jewels, was strapped to the saddle behind him, a tempting prize for the bandits that infested the shadowed forests and treacherous mountain passes. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of adrenaline through him.  He was alone, his loyal companions lost to a fever weeks ago, now battling both nature and desperate men to reach the distant city of Prague.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, pushing the ship's aging hyperdrive to its limits.  But the potential reward – a legendary alien artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – was worth the risk.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers were just another day's work for the seasoned captain.  The galaxy was a vast and unforgiving place, but the thrill of discovery fueled her every action.
