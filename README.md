
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  The map, a crudely drawn parchment, promised riches in the distant city of Samarkand – silks, spices, and perhaps even a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of a plague sweeping across the land shadowed her every step.  Survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, his starship a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of the cosmos.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy was fraught with peril; asteroid fields, rogue nebulae, and the ever-present threat of pirates stalked his vessel.  But the lure of unlocking the universe's greatest mysteries, of charting unmapped constellations and discovering new worlds, fuelled his courage, making the risks worth taking.
