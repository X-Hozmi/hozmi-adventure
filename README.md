
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his mount onward.  The journey to King Edward's court was arduous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the endless expanse of fields tested their meager supplies. Yet, the knight pressed on, driven by a promise whispered by a dying man – a promise of justice, a quest that would test his courage and loyalty like no other.  Each sunrise brought the uncertain hope of reaching his destination, each sunset the looming fear of ambush or starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey was fraught with its own perils; rogue asteroids threatened to pierce their shields, spatial anomalies warped their trajectory, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed. But unlike Sir Reginald, Eva had the technology of a future age at her disposal – faster-than-light drives, advanced weaponry, and a crew whose expertise transcended the limitations of medieval travel.  Yet, the same spirit of adventure, the same unwavering pursuit of a distant goal, burned bright in both their hearts.
