
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, navigated the treacherous, rutted track.  Each creak of his saddle was a potential threat, each shadow a lurking bandit.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the King across the war-torn kingdom – was a desperate race against time and the elements.  He'd faced down torrential rains, skirted skirmishes between warring factions, and bartered his way past suspicious border guards, his resolve hardening with each challenge overcome.  The sheer physical and mental endurance demanded by such a journey tested even the most seasoned knight.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, spanning months under the constant hum of the hyperdrive, was punctuated by automated system checks and the vast, awe-inspiring emptiness of space.  While less physically demanding than Reginald's ordeal, the mental strain of interstellar travel – the isolation, the responsibility for her crew's survival, the inherent risks of encountering unknown phenomena – presented a different kind of daunting adventure.
