
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel, containing a cryptic map and a dwindling supply of dried figs, was her only companion besides the biting wind and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creaking footstep closer to the legendary city of Ys felt like a victory against the elements, the relentless sun, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.  Rumors of magical artifacts and forgotten knowledge fuelled her perilous journey, promising a reward far surpassing the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable weather patterns and fiercely territorial Kryll.  The galaxy held infinite wonders, but also countless dangers – from rogue asteroids to hostile alien civilizations.  The reward, however, the survival of his crew and potentially his entire sector, justified the gamble.
