
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  The whispers of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and overflowing with spices, fueled her journey.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous mountain pass, each fleeting encounter with bandits and wandering knights, etched itself into her memory, a testament to the unpredictable beauty and brutality of medieval travel.  The promise of adventure, however perilous, outweighed the ever-present threat of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the faint glow of distant galaxies painting the cockpit in vibrant hues.  His mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the vast gulf between civilizations.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of space – rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the uncharted expanse of the cosmos – presented a different kind of thrill.  The quest for knowledge, for the unknown, propelled him onward, despite the ever-present threat of the black.
