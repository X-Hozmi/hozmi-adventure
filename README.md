
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on our backs.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, sent shivers down our spines. We journeyed from York to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked our every step, and the unforgiving terrain tested our strength and resolve. Yet, the allure of the distant, sun-baked lands fueled our onward march, a thirst for the unknown outweighing the ever-present dangers.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the ship.  Across the star-strewn void, Andromeda galaxy shimmered, a destination light-years from our home world.  While the journey was faster than any medieval trek, the sense of adventure remained unchanged.  The unknown, whether a hostile alien civilization or a previously uncharted nebula, provided an intoxicating mix of fear and excitement. Each warp jump felt like a leap of faith, a gamble against the cosmos, but the promise of discovery kept us pushing forward, towards the farthest reaches of the known universe.
