
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and resolve, the vast and unforgiving landscape a testament to both the beauty and brutality of medieval travel.  He pressed on, driven by a hope as boundless as the horizon itself.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with peril.  Nebula storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were hazards as real as any medieval bandit.  Her advanced technology offered a shield against the universe's harshness, but the loneliness of interstellar travel, the vast emptiness between worlds, was a constant companion.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of making contact with a lost civilization, fueled her determination, driving her across the star-dusted canvas of the cosmos.
