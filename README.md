
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth spurred his destrier onward, the weight of his quest heavy on his shoulders.  His journey, a perilous pilgrimage across the breadth of Francia to retrieve the lost relic of Saint Fiacre, had already claimed two of his companions.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in fairytale.  Yet, the glint of the setting sun on his battered armor fueled his resolve, each mile a step closer to salvation – or ruin.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The challenges were different – navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and the constant threat of unknown celestial phenomena. But the thrill of exploration, the allure of the uncharted, burned as brightly in her heart as it had in Sir Gareth’s, a timeless human yearning for the adventure that lay beyond the known horizon.
