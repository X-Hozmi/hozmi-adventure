
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just provisions; it holds the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a war-torn village.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, heightens the sense of adventure, a dangerous game of survival against bandits, famine, and the unforgiving elements.  Her journey is a tapestry woven with the threads of fear, resilience, and the unwavering determination to reach the rumored sanctuary across the mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with peril; rogue asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make every jump a gamble. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of unlocking interstellar secrets, fuels her crew’s courage as they push the boundaries of known space, charting a course through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
