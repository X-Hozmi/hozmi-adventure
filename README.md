
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a daunting but necessary passage to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey, yet the whispered tales of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient magic fuel her onward. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the cold light of a binary sunset.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach.  The vast emptiness of space holds both wonder and peril.  Warp jumps risk encountering unpredictable nebulae or hostile alien factions.  The weight of responsibility for her crew and the future of humanity rests heavily on her shoulders, but the thrill of discovery, the sheer breathtaking scale of the cosmos, makes it all worthwhile.
