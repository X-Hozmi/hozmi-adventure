
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a crumbling kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and adventure. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions on her journey eastward, towards a whispered legend of a fertile valley beyond the mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet curtain of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae, dodging asteroid fields the size of small moons, was a routine far removed from Elara's ordeal, yet the thrill of the unknown remained.  The quest for a new habitable world, a haven for humanity’s scattered colonies, felt as perilous and promising as Elara's search for a new beginning.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness, a cosmic echo of the solitary traveler's journey across the medieval world.
