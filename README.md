
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, whispered to be hidden beyond the treacherous Serpent's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or danger.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself posed constant threats, but the lure of Ys, and the whispered secrets it held, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula, its warp drive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a region teeming with unmapped planets and the potential for new resources – or hostile alien civilizations.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the complex political landscape of the galactic federation, Ryla faced challenges as perilous as any medieval knight, only her armor was reinforced alloys and her steed, a vessel capable of crossing the vast emptiness between worlds.
