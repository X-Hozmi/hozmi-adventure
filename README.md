
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey across the vast, unknown expanse of medieval Europe and Asia.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and facing the existential dread of the infinite – these were the challenges for this intrepid explorer, as she charted a course through unmapped star systems, venturing where no human had gone before.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns.
