
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onwards, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, had already tested her resolve.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the hardships faced. Yet, the whispers of a miraculous relic spurred her onward, the promise of adventure outweighing the ever-present risk of death or capture.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of both fear and exhilaration.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar space was a daily reality.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fueled her determination.  The vastness of space was a terrifying and magnificent tapestry, woven with the threads of potential discovery and the looming threat of the uncharted.
