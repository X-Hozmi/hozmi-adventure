
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her family, clinging to the promise of a new life in Constantinople.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sparks a fresh surge of adrenaline.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey, a stark reminder of the risks and rewards of medieval travel.  The shimmering spires of the city, a distant mirage on the horizon, fuel her determination to press on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst cosmic wonders and unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines of time and space, yet the thrill of discovery remains as potent as ever.  Each jump into hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, punctuated by the eerie silence of the void and the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena unseen by human eyes before. The vastness of the cosmos presents challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, but the spirit of adventure burns just as brightly.
