
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost civilizations and unimaginable riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the siren song of adventure, propelled her onward, her heart pounding in rhythm with the hooves of her mount, a fierce determination etched on her sun-weathered face.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of warping spacetime itself.  The vastness of the cosmos, peppered with treacherous asteroid fields and unknown alien entities, presented a different kind of peril, but the thrill of exploration, the gamble of discovery, fueled his journey just as strongly as it had fueled Elara's. The stars themselves seemed to beckon, promising untold wonders – or ultimate oblivion.
