
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary steed across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, famine, or worse – the dreaded Black Death.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing daughter. The journey is a tapestry woven with the vibrant threads of bustling market towns and the stark terror of desolate wilderness, each mile a gamble against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a legendary energy source capable of powering entire star systems.  Unlike Reginald, her enemy isn't disease or bandits, but the treacherous currents of hyperspace and the shadowy K'tharr Syndicate, who'll stop at nothing to claim the crystal for themselves.  Her journey across galaxies is measured not in leagues, but in light-years, a test of both technological prowess and unwavering courage against the unimaginable vastness of space.
