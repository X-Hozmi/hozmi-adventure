
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send man and beast tumbling to their deaths, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the nights.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience and unwavering hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the rumored paradise planet of Aethel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Faster-than-light travel was a gamble, warping spacetime around her ship, while alien lifeforms, some hostile, some enigmatic, tested her crew's courage and ingenuity.  The treasure of Aethel, a source of limitless energy, was worth the impossible odds, however.
