
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the unpredictable terrain tested his endurance at every turn.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory, as Thomas navigated the treacherous landscapes of medieval Europe, his faith and resolve his only true companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hyperspace jumps and careful navigation amidst asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a testament to humanity's boundless ambition and the unforgiving nature of interstellar travel.
