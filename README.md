
The year is 1348, and the world is gripped by the Black Death.  A young knight, Sir Gareth, embarks on a perilous journey across war-torn Europe.  He seeks a legendary herb rumored to hold the cure, facing treacherous bandits, ravenous wolves, and the pestilence itself. His path winds through crumbling castles, dense forests, and bustling market towns, each encounter testing his courage and pushing him closer to the truth of the ancient legend.  

Centuries later, in the year 2342, Captain Aella of the Starfarer crew embarks on a mission across the Milky Way.  Their target: a newly discovered planet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  Their vessel, a sleek and powerful starship, navigates a treacherous field of asteroids and encounters rogue space pirates, each threat a test of their skills and a reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the familiar stars.  Aella's journey is one of scientific exploration, political intrigue, and the ever-present possibility of first contact with a new, unknown civilization.
