
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains crimson. Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's illness, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and courage, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled her onward.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, a kaleidoscope of shimmering gas and cosmic dust obscuring her destination – Kepler-186f.  This wasn't a quest for a mythical cure, but for a new beginning for humanity.  The journey across light-years challenged not only her navigational skills but also her crew's resilience against the relentless pressure of interstellar travel, the chilling isolation of deep space, and the constant threat of unforeseen anomalies.  The galaxy promised adventure, but demanded a price.
