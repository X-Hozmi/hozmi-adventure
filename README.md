
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of the approaching storm. His journey across the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present fear of disease gnawed at his resolve.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, fueled by ancient maps and a thirst for the unknown, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, mapping a course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, while the ever-present threat of pirate raids and unpredictable subspace currents kept her crew vigilant.  The allure of discovery, the promise of new life, far outweighed the risks of this interstellar voyage.
