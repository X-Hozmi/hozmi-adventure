
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep into the mire.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them relentlessly forward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a dream.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with unforeseen dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, outwitting pirate factions, and enduring the psychological toll of isolation were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, however, held a majesty that dwarfed even the most perilous encounter, a constant reminder of the incredible scale of the human spirit’s drive to explore the unknown.
