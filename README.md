
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small prices to pay for the glory and fortune that awaited him at journey's end.  Each creak of the saddle, each crunch of mud beneath the horse's hooves, was a step closer to legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the chilling silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines, was a constant reminder of the monumental risks and incredible rewards of interstellar travel.  The promise of discovering new life, charting uncharted territories, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled her journey across the cosmic ocean, a voyage far more perilous, yet equally exhilarating, as Thomas's medieval quest.
