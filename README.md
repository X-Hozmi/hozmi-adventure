
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald’s warhorse as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fuels his journey, pushing him ever onward through the vast, unknown expanse of medieval Europe and beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the uncharted nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to possess technology capable of averting a looming galactic war.  Instead of bandits, she confronts hostile alien lifeforms and treacherous asteroid fields; instead of starvation, she faces dwindling oxygen supplies and malfunctioning systems.  The vastness of space, filled with both wonder and peril, tests her crew's resilience, pushing them to the limits of human endurance as they navigate the unimaginable distances between worlds, their fate hanging in the balance.
