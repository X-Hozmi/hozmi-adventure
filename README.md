
The year is 1348.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – seeds of hope for a village ravaged by famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each stumble of the mule, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain.  Yet, the thought of her people, and the possibility of a bountiful harvest, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's vibrant hues.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Ryla's crew faced cosmic radiation and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life. But the allure of discovery, the promise of a technological leap for humanity, pushed them further into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
