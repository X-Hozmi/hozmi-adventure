
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  This journey to the fabled monastery at the edge of the known world is fraught with peril; bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions. Yet, the hope within her fuels her onward, each sunrise a promise of inching closer to salvation.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos star system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, Ryla and her crew face dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers. Yet, the lure of unexplored worlds and the promise of revolutionizing interstellar travel outweigh the risk, driving them further into the uncharted cosmic expanse.
