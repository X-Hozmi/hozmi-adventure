
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a stark contrast to the whispering forests and treacherous mountain passes he'd already traversed.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fueled his weary legs and hardened his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing vital systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation were all part of a day's work.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to make first contact with a new civilization, pushed her and her crew across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
