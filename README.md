
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of glory and discovery, pushed him relentlessly forward, through sun-drenched plains and windswept deserts, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the distant Solarian Confederacy and the enigmatic K'tharr Empire, a journey spanning light-years and encompassing the perils of uncharted space.  Asteroids the size of mountains, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of exploring the galaxy, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and forging new pathways across the vast, shimmering tapestry of the cosmos.
