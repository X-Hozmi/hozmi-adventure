
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and sweat thick in the air. Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile map promising a hidden monastery rumored to contain the lost scriptures of St. Cyril.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of illness were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown, a journey fueled by faith and the whispers of legend. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience and unwavering purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of her cockpit.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor sentient life forms unlike any encountered before.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms were part of the routine for a galaxy-hopping explorer.  The vastness of space, however, held no fear for Eva;  it was the promise of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, that truly ignited her spirit.
