
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the shimmering mirage of an oasis promising respite, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  Our destination, the legendary city of Samarkand, felt as distant and improbable as the stars themselves, yet the shared hardship and whispered tales of its riches spurred us onward, a testament to the enduring human spirit’s quest for discovery.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, my starship, cuts a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the inky void, where nebulae paint breathtaking landscapes and alien civilizations might await, both benevolent and hostile. The thrill is not in dodging bandits, but in navigating asteroid fields and encountering the unfathomable wonders of a universe far grander and more dangerous than any medieval kingdom.
