
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Zerzura's splendor, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for colonization.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations. But the promise of discovering new worlds, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the universe.
