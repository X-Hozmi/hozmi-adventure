
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, has led her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and past shimmering oases that offered only fleeting respite.  Each day brings new dangers – the scorching heat, ravenous wolves, and the ever-present threat of hostile tribes – yet the allure of Zerzura, with its whispered promises of untold riches and ancient magic, fuels her onward.  The journey is arduous, but the spirit of adventure burns bright within her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a cosmic anomaly decades ago.  Warp drives hum, spitting her vessel through swirling galaxies and past celestial bodies of unimaginable scale and beauty.  The dangers are different now – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown spacefaring entities – but the same thirst for discovery and the thrill of the unknown drive Ryla forward.  The cosmos is a vast and unforgiving frontier, yet the promise of finding Kepler-186f and unraveling its mysteries makes the journey worthwhile.
