
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her small band of companions traverse the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine of healing, leads them across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-haunted forests, and across sun-baked plains where bandits lurk in the shadows.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – a ford to cross, a crumbling castle to navigate, a desperate plea for aid from a starving village. Their survival depends on their wits, their courage, and the unpredictable whims of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from a remote, uncharted planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Her crew, a diverse team of specialists, faces perils far beyond those encountered by medieval travelers.  Nebulae shroud their path, hostile alien life forms threaten their ship, and the very fabric of spacetime seems to conspire against them.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of unimaginable advancement, fuels their unwavering determination.
