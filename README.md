
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail glinting under the unforgiving sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils as he traversed the muddy track, leaving the familiar comfort of his manor far behind. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown bushes, held the potential for bandit ambush, treacherous terrain, or worse – the unseen horrors whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled his every step.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson light of Xylos painting the bridge of the 'Starseeker' in an ethereal glow. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silence of the void.  Ahead lay unknown dangers – uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving expanse of space.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, spurred her crew onward, making the unimaginable distances a worthy price to pay.
