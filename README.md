
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks crimson. Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve at every turn, each sunrise bringing a new challenge and a renewed determination to press onward.  The journey was arduous, a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty, but the hope of healing fueled her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of system failures was routine;  the vast emptiness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  The weight of responsibility for her crew, the allure of the unknown, and the possibility of discovering a lost civilization propelled her ship forward, a tiny speck against the infinite backdrop of the cosmos.
