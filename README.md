
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guides her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration. Yet, the burning hope for her brother fuels her onward, making even the most daunting landscapes seem surmountable.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space is a different kind of challenge – the constant hum of the engines, the threat of rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien lifeforms. But the weight of responsibility for the colonists' survival, the allure of exploring the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration propel her forward.
