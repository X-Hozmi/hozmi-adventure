
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a victory hard-earned.  The lure of the unknown, the whisper of legend, fuelled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space tested her courage and skill.  But the promise of discovery, the potential to reshape the future of humankind, spurred her onward through the inky blackness, a tiny ship against the vast, indifferent majesty of the cosmos.
