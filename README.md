The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a forest primeval, promising both peril and untold riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a thrill of anticipation – or fear – down his spine.

But the allure of the unknown, the promise of new worlds and untold knowledge, propelled her onward.
