
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of St. Elara, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, wolves howled in the distance, and the gnawing hunger threatened to overtake her. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the springs a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later,  Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast distances separated him from his home planet, and the galaxy teemed with uncharted systems, each a potential source of wonder or unimaginable danger.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the cosmos after a catastrophic warp storm.  He relied on ancient star charts, cryptic transmissions, and the unwavering loyalty of his AI companion, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll raiders. The universe, a boundless expanse of possibility and peril, stretched before him.
