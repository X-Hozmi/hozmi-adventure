
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's decree, a quest to retrieve a sacred relic from the far-off monastery of St. Jude, burned brighter than any hearth fire in his belly.  His journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship;  muddy tracks turning to treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and nights spent shivering under a meagre cloak.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown propelled him forward, the whispered legends of the relic fueling his weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking yet terrifying expanse of shimmering stars and silent voids, held both wonder and peril.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of time and space. The fate of a lost civilization rested on her shoulders, and the weight of that responsibility spurred her on through the cosmic unknown.
