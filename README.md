
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in unfamiliar villages, and constantly vigilant against the unpredictable dangers of the medieval world.  Their adventure was not a quest for gold, but for spiritual solace, a journey fueled by faith and grit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian crystals rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances between star systems presented their own unique hardships.  Warp-drive malfunctions, hostile alien encounters, and the constant strain of interstellar navigation pushed her and her crew to their limits. Unlike the medieval pilgrims, their quest was fueled by scientific ambition, a race against time and the unknown depths of space,  seeking not salvation, but the advancement of humankind.
