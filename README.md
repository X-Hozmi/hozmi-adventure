
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried rations; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to secure a rumored alliance with a remote, mountain-dwelling clan.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, promised either salvation or a swift end in the unforgiving wilderness.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey across the fractured land.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant lullaby, masking the breathtaking vista of nebulae and distant, swirling galaxies. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a colony rumoured to possess technology capable of ending the interstellar war.  The vastness of the cosmos held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble between triumph and annihilation.
