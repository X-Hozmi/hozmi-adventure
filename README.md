
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of Provence, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the desperate hope fueling his journey across the unforgiving terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast distances conquered by humanity.  Yet, even amidst the marvels of interstellar travel, the familiar dangers persisted: pirate attacks, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering something utterly alien and unknowable in the cold, dark expanse of space.
