
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise bringing new challenges and testing his resolve.  The journey was brutal, a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty – a stark landscape reflecting the desperate hope in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Advanced technology eased some burdens, but the vastness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, driven by a sense of duty and the lingering hope of finding survivors amidst the cosmic expanse.
