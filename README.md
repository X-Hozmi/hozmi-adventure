
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the western sea.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, but the whisper of forgotten magic and the promise of untold riches fuel her onward, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a testament to her unwavering courage.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive a comforting drone against the infinite silence of space.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to harbor a sentient, hostile plant life.  With a crackle of static, his comms crackle to life, relaying a warning of unexpected gravitational anomalies and pirate activity.  Jax grips the controls, his gaze fixed on the swirling cosmos, ready to face whatever dangers lie ahead in his quest across the galaxy.
