
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than her grandfather.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each distant hawk cry, held the potential for both peril and wonder.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical creatures haunted the nights.  But the lure of the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and knowledge, spurred her onward, a relentless ember in her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating by the faintest glimmer of quasars, she and her crew braved asteroid fields and nebulae of unimaginable beauty and danger.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  They sought the lost colony of Xylos, a world whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a treasure more valuable than any gold or jewel. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held a chilling emptiness, a constant reminder of their isolation and the perilous journey ahead.
