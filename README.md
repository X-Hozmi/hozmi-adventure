
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of knights pushed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that swirled around them like vengeful spirits. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, the landscape shifting from rolling hills to treacherous mountain passes, the constant threat of bandits and wild beasts a chilling companion. Each sunrise brought renewed determination, each sunset a testament to their courage in the face of the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, the vast, inky blackness of space a constant reminder of their isolation. Yet, the thrill of exploration fueled their journey, the possibility of discovering new life and untold wonders a beacon in the cosmic darkness.
