
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to bury them under a blizzard.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new obstacle to overcome, testing their resilience and forging bonds stronger than any forged steel. Their destination promised untold riches and glory, but the true reward lay in the shared experiences of their arduous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Their mission: to chart unexplored galaxies for the Galactic Federation.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet the vastness of space held its own terrifying beauty.  Unpredictable solar flares and rogue asteroid fields were constant threats, while the potential discovery of unknown, hostile lifeforms added an element of thrilling suspense. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, but for Comet, the endless exploration of the cosmos was a siren's call he couldn't resist.
