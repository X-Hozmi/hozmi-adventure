
The sun beat down on the dusty road as the caravan lumbered across the parched landscape.  A young knight, barely out of his teens, gripped his sword, a knot of excitement twisting in his gut.  He had left the safety of his castle walls for this, for the thrill of unknown lands, the chance to face down bandits and monsters, to carve his own legend into the fabric of the world.  The whispers of ancient ruins, of forgotten cities and lost treasures, fuelled his every step, urging him onward. 

The starship hummed with a quiet, confident energy as it hurtled towards the distant nebula, a vibrant swirl of gas and dust.  Captain Aiko, her eyes narrowed against the glare of the hyperdrive, felt a familiar thrill course through her.  She had always yearned for the vastness of space, the endless possibilities that lay beyond the familiar confines of their solar system.  Each new planet, each encounter with alien life, was a step into the unknown, a gamble on the potential for wonder, for discovery, for the chance to rewrite the history of their species.
