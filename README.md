
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, represented all she possessed on this perilous journey to find her estranged brother, rumored to have joined a mercenary band far to the east.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, felt like a potential threat in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.  Banditry and disease were constant companions on the road, a stark reminder of the risks inherent in medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riker piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant, alien landscape outside his viewport paled in comparison to the thrill of charting unexplored galactic territories.  His mission: to locate a lost colony ship, a vessel swallowed by the cosmos years ago.  The vastness of space, a seemingly endless expanse of shimmering stars and perilous black holes, presented challenges far removed from medieval limitations but equally daunting.  Survival depended on navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering cryptic alien signals, and facing the unknown with unwavering courage.
