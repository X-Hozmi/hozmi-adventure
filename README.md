
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, resting on a single, precious seed said to hold the cure for a devastating blight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the thought of her people spurred her onward, a beacon in the fading light.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  While the dangers weren't bandits and beasts, but rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of engine failure, the drive was similar – a relentless push towards a goal that held the promise of a new beginning, a new home for humanity amidst the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
