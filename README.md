
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in his relentless pursuit of legend.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new opportunity to test his courage and resilience against the harsh realities of medieval travel. The vast unknown stretched before him, a tapestry woven with danger and the intoxicating promise of discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable temporal anomalies of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the same allure as the medieval plains – a boundless expanse brimming with peril and the irresistible call of the unknown.
