
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, guiding him toward the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down his spine – a mix of fear and exhilarating anticipation.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils he faced in his quest for fortune and glory.  The vastness of the unknown stretched before him, a tapestry woven with both danger and the promise of incredible riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas unfolding outside the cockpit – swirling cosmic dust, distant galaxies spiralling into infinity.  The journey was fraught with its own dangers: asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on interstellar trade routes.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories amongst the stars, fuelled her relentless pursuit of the unknown.
