
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the seed of a new life, a chance to escape the failing harvest and encroaching war in her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant wolf howl, is a reminder of the perilous journey ahead, but the burning hope for a better future fuels her onward.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain are constant threats, yet the lure of the unknown whispers promises of prosperity and peace beyond the mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby, masking the vast, awe-inspiring emptiness of space.  This isn't a simple cargo run;  Eva carries a team of terraformers, pioneers of a new age, tasked with establishing a human foothold on a potentially habitable world.  The risks are unimaginable – hostile alien life, equipment malfunctions, the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel – yet the promise of expansion, of building a new civilization among the stars, keeps her engines roaring towards the unknown.
