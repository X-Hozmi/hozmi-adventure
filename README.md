
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining with the weight of his pack, squinted at the setting sun.  Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto his face, mirroring the rugged landscape they'd traversed.  From the windswept moors of the north, they'd journeyed through dense forests haunted by whispers of bandits, forded treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and finally, crested the imposing peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Their quest – to retrieve the lost relic of Saint Alaric – felt as daunting as the endless horizon before them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace.  The thrill of exploration, the sheer audacity of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled her and her crew, a band of intrepid pioneers facing the unimaginable vastness of space with courage, hope, and a shared sense of wonder.
