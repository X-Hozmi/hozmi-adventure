
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the parched plains.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland, pushes him onward.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are daily challenges, but the unwavering hope of salvation fuels his relentless journey, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape. He dreams of lush valleys and shimmering spires, a stark contrast to the harsh realities of his medieval pilgrimage.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer', its sleek hull a testament to humanity's interstellar reach.  Her mission: to survey the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity's expanding diaspora.  Warp jumps across light years are commonplace, yet the void between stars holds its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  Eva, a seasoned explorer, navigates these perils with unwavering skill, her gaze fixed on the distant promise of new worlds, a future far removed from the dusty trails of her ancestors.
