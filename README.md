
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the desert itself threatened to swallow her whole. Yet, the allure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her on, each creak of her saddle a testament to her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula shimmering with amethyst and emerald light.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and the whispers of unknown, hostile lifeforms haunted the ship's comms.  But Eva, hardened by countless voyages across the cosmos, pressed onward, her heart fueled by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the secrets of the lost colony.
