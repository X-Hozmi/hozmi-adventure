
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the next windswept hill, the skeletal remains of a long-dead castle silhouetted against the bruised purple of the setting sun.  His quest – to find the mythical Sunstone hidden within the treacherous Serpent's Teeth mountains – had tested him beyond endurance.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger had thinned his ranks, but the glint of gold rumored to protect the Sunstone fueled his weary resolve.  Each step was a gamble, each sunrise a new challenge in this unforgiving land.


Centuries hence, Captain Elara Reyes navigated the crimson nebula known as the Widow's Veil, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the jump between galaxies still held a thrill, a sliver of the unknown that always gnawed at the edges of her meticulously planned voyages.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The vastness of space, while less immediately threatening than a medieval battlefield, held perils of its own – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids across the galactic frontier.
