
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promised hardship, but also the rumored lost city of Eldoria, its gold-filled temples whispered about in hushed tavern tales.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril – in equal measure. Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant companions on her journey across the harsh, beautiful landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Starseeker*.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize sought after by countless factions across the galaxy.  The jump to hyperspace was always risky, a leap of faith into the unknown where spatial distortions could crush a ship like an eggshell.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting new star systems and encountering alien civilizations, fueled Jax's unwavering determination, making the inherent danger a small price to pay for the grand adventure ahead.
