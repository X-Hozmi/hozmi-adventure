
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or the insidious plague itself.  Survival, let alone success, depended on courage, cunning, and a healthy dose of luck.


Thousands of years later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates, Elara relied on her advanced technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vastness of space presented its own unique dangers, but the promise of discovery fuelled their relentless journey across the uncharted cosmos.
