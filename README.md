
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, more faded wish than reliable guide, offered little solace against the looming peaks and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her as she pressed onward, driven by a desperate hope to reach the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened its icy hold.  The journey was fraught with peril, a constant dance between survival and the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the immeasurable expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, a far cry from the simple dangers Elara had faced.  But the allure of the uncharted Andromeda galaxy, with its whispers of ancient civilizations and untold riches, burned brighter than any earthly sun.  Eva's journey, like Elara's before her, was a testament to the human spirit's enduring quest for discovery, a brave voyage into the vast, unforgiving beauty of the cosmos.
