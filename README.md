
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a cryptic message promising both unimaginable riches and certain death, had lured him from his quiet village life.  His journey, a tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, the allure of ancient ruins whispering forgotten lore, and the ever-present hunger gnawing at his belly, was far from the simple pilgrimage he’d initially envisioned.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of both dread and exhilarating possibility.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unmapped wormholes and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  The vast, alien landscapes swirling outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, but the loneliness of space, the crushing weight of responsibility, and the constant hum of the ship's engines were a constant reminder of the immense distance between her and the familiar embrace of Earth. The discovery of a new planet, however, promised a reward worth the cosmic gamble.
