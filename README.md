
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward through the muddied tracks of France.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their quest, a mythical lost city rumored to hold unimaginable riches, spurred them on, defying the biting winds and the gnawing hunger.  The clanging of their armor and the rhythmic thud of horses' hooves were a constant counterpoint to the eerie silence of the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  The ship, a marvel of advanced technology, hummed with the energy of its warp drive, a tiny vessel navigating an ocean of stars.  The vastness of space was both exhilarating and terrifying, the sheer scale of the cosmos dwarfing even the grandest medieval adventures.  Yet, the human spirit – the same drive for discovery that propelled knights across medieval Europe – pushed Eva onward, towards the unknown.
