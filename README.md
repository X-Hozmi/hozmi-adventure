
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the lure of adventure propelled her onward, fuelled by a desperate hope and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, yet the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies remained undimmed.  The whispers of ancient civilizations on distant planets beckoned, promising untold scientific discoveries and alien encounters – risks she willingly embraced, knowing that the greatest adventures lie beyond the familiar, in the vast, unpredictable expanse of the cosmos.
