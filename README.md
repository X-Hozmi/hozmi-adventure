
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her face.  Before her lay the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Black Forest, a legend whispered in hushed tones in her village.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill and danger, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation lurking in the shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the K'tharr Hegemony's territory.  Her mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of rare minerals across the galaxy to a remote colony on the edge of known space.  The vastness of the cosmos, the alien landscapes glimpsed on distant planets, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive, all added to the heady mix of excitement and trepidation that defined interstellar travel in the 27th century.
