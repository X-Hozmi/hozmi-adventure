
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless expanse of the French countryside, the promised bounty of the Lyon markets a distant dream.  Bandit whispers echoed in the whispering wind, a constant reminder of the perils that lurked beyond the next sun-baked hill. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, turning the journey into a constant test of endurance and vigilance.  He yearned for the camaraderie of fellow travelers, but mostly he yearned for the cool shade of a tavern and a flagon of ale.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been flawlessly executed, but the unknown awaited them on the other side: a potentially hostile environment and the tantalizing possibility of discovering a new, sentient life form.  The hum of the ship’s engines provided a soothing counterpoint to the crackling static of subspace comms, her gaze fixed on the holographic star chart mapping their course through the uncharted cosmic wilderness.  The thrill of exploration, far removed from the medieval struggles, but no less perilous, filled her with a sense of wonder and unwavering determination.
