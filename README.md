
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, his once-bright armour dulled by relentless sun and rain.  Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his horse, echoed the perilous journey ahead. Whispers of a hidden monastery, said to hold ancient secrets, spurred him onward, through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  He rode towards the unknown, a knight errant seeking not glory, but knowledge – a quest as challenging as any dragon's hoard.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her journey wasn’t measured in leagues, but in light-years, a voyage across the vast cosmic ocean to a distant galaxy rumored to harbor a lost civilization.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the silence of space, a lonely counterpoint to the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and the unpredictable nature of warp travel.  Her destination: a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
