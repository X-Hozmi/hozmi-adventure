
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the constant threat of illness hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each crest conquered, each village encountered, her spirit soared.  The shared stories around crackling fires, the kindness of strangers, the breathtaking landscapes – these were the treasures far surpassing any earthly riches.  This was adventure, raw and untamed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable cosmic wonders.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's trek, Eva faced the chilling isolation of deep space, the unpredictable behavior of alien energy fields, and the constant gnawing fear of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, lifeforms.  But the thrill of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of nebulas and newly-formed star systems, fueled her resolve.  This was adventure on a galactic scale.
