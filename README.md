
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snaked its way across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the mysterious plague whispered to be stalking the land.  We carried with us not gold or jewels, but the fragile hope of a new life, a new beginning far from the ravaged fields of our homeland.  The journey was brutal, but the promise of a different future fueled our steps forward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion, a thrumming counterpoint to the breathtaking views of swirling nebulae and distant galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-like planet light-years away.  The risks were different now – radiation storms, navigational errors that could send us hurtling into oblivion, the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events.  But the allure of discovery, of finding life beyond our own pale blue dot, outweighed the dangers.  We carried the hopes of humanity with us, a testament to our relentless curiosity and indomitable spirit.
