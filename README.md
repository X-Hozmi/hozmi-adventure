
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the endless expanse of the Salisbury Plain stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of starvation. Yet, the allure of Ys, a beacon of hope in a world consumed by despair, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with cosmic hazards, unmapped singularities, and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a familiar comfort against the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of space; a stark contrast to the earthbound dangers of Sir Reginald's era, but just as demanding in its own way, demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering spirit to survive.
