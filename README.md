
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her hand, promised a hidden monastery, whispered to hold ancient secrets.  Ahead lay days of uncertain travel – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the allure of the unknown propelled her onward, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a fragile respite.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the jump to Kepler-186f initiating with a violent lurch.  He'd traded the medieval uncertainties for the cosmic unknown, traversing the vast gulf between solar systems in a vessel barely holding together.  The cargo – rare minerals from a dying star – was worth the risk, even if pirates and unpredictable wormholes threatened their every jump.  The breathtaking nebulae and alien vistas were a reward in themselves, a far cry from the monotonous landscapes of old Earth, but the lonely expanse of space, much like the medieval plains, held its own brand of isolating terror.
