
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Rhône valley, a ribbon of green snaking towards the distant, hazy peaks of the Alps.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a lost relative, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers were treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, with each sunrise, Elara found renewed strength in the beauty of the land and the unwavering hope that fuelled her arduous trek.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Unlike Elara's journey, Eva's was not hampered by physical limitations, but by the vast, unforgiving nature of space itself; asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate attacks were her daily challenges. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, propelled her onwards, across the cosmic ocean.
