
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue crested the windswept hill, their meager supplies bouncing in their saddlebags.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and dark forests whispering tales of bandits and sorcerers.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of saving their kingdom from a devastating plague. Each creak of leather and jingle of spurs was a testament to the perils and uncertainties that lay ahead, a journey measured not in miles but in the grit of determination and the unwavering hope for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship’s AI humming a steady counterpoint to the crackle of the comms.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unknown gravitational anomalies and potentially hostile alien life.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars, held both immense promise and terrifying unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking and unpredictable frontier of the cosmos.
