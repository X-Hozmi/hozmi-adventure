
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred by the whispers of a mythical city of gold, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the vast steppe in fiery hues.  Each creak of our overloaded cart, each snort of our exhausted horses, marked another mile closer to the unknown – a journey fraught with peril from bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the unforgiving elements, and the gnawing uncertainty of our quest.  We pressed on, driven by the glimmering promise of fortune and the thrill of the unexplored.

Centuries later, the Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of generations, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life.  The endless void, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae, was a constant reminder of the vastness and isolation of space.  Yet, the camaraderie of the crew, bound by a shared thirst for discovery, and the tantalizing possibility of encountering alien civilizations, fueled our relentless journey towards the unknown frontiers of the cosmos.
