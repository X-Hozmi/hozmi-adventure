
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a chipped map, a few meager coins, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Carcassonne before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, of bandits or benevolent strangers, of hardship and unexpected fortune. The journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown kept her spurred on.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to the colossal task before them. Their starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies, the destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond human comprehension.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each alien encounter a potential for discovery or annihilation.  The stakes were higher than ever before, but the potential reward, a new era of galactic exploration, fuelled their unwavering determination.
