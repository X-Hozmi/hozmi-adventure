He’d traded the comforts of court for the thrill of the unknown, his quest a perilous journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold a relic of immense power.

But the greatest danger was the unknown, the silent expanse teeming with possibilities both breathtaking and terrifying.  Her courage, and the cutting-edge technology of her ship, were their only hope.
