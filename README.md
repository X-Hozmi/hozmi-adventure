
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, urged his weary steed onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, whispered rumors of monstrous beasts haunted the deeper woods, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, Reginald pressed on, driven by a thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches hidden within the legendary lost city of Eldoria. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held its own perils – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile alien life.  But the allure of discovering new worlds, charting unexplored territories, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge fueled her relentless journey.  The cosmos held infinite possibilities, and Eva was ready to claim them.
