
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to find the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Ys, and the hope it offers, fuels his journey, pushing him onward despite the hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in years.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms is commonplace, but the true danger lies in the unknown.  Ancient, powerful entities are rumored to dwell in the unexplored reaches of space, and the whispers of their existence chill Elara to her core, even as the boundless wonder of the cosmos beckons her onward.
