
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting lamb from distant villages offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease.  Her quest – to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria – was a perilous gamble, a journey fraught with hardship and uncertainty, but the whispered tales of its untold riches spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both danger and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigation was a delicate dance between celestial charts and instinct, the vast emptiness a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced not only the challenges of interstellar navigation and unpredictable wormholes, but also the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. The universe held boundless wonders, but also unimaginable perils.
