
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks a fiery orange.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Elara, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen by spring melt, and into the shadowed forests where brigands lurked. Each sunrise brought new perils, from the sting of hunger to the threat of ambushes, testing his courage and resilience with every mile.  His only companions were his battered sword, a dwindling supply of dried meat, and the unwavering hope of success.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation through the chaotic gravitational fields tested the limits of her ship's AI, while the constant threat of pirate raids kept her crew on high alert.  Their mission: to secure a rare element vital to galactic energy grids from the hostile K'tharr colony on the planet Kepler-186f.  Eva, gazing out at the breathtaking tapestry of stars, felt the same thrill of discovery and danger that must have driven medieval adventurers—only her battles were fought amongst the stars, her compass guided by celestial navigation, and her prize the future of a galaxy.
