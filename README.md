
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril, each sunset a precarious victory, as he pushed further into the unknown, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a yearning for the legendary riches promised at journey's end.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora and potential dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, the vastness of space both exhilarating and terrifying.  With every jump through hyperspace, Eva risked everything, driven by the responsibility of ensuring her crew's survival and the future of humanity's energy supply.
