
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death still echoed in the wind. This journey, a pilgrimage of life and death, tests not only her physical endurance but also her unwavering spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint glimmer of quasars and the whisper of wormhole currents, her crew charts a course to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vast emptiness of space is a constant companion, punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the crackle of comms.  The risks are immense – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships – but the potential rewards, a future free from intergalactic conflict, make the perilous voyage worthwhile.
