
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable treasures and arcane knowledge, pushed us forward, fueled by hope and a thirst for adventure beyond the confines of our known world.  The rough-hewn map, our only guide, promised riches but also untold dangers.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel of impossibly advanced technology, pierced the veil of the cosmos, its destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy. Captain Eva Rostova, her weathered face reflecting the countless nebulae she'd traversed, held firm at the helm, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering light years away.  The journey was not without peril; asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested the crew's skills and courage. But the promise of untold wonders, of new life forms and breathtaking landscapes, spurred them on towards the unknown.
