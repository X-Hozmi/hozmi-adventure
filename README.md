
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves echoing on the frozen ground.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of ending a devastating plague.  Each day brought fresh challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of Ys, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits, pushing them further into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the distant Sol system.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp core instability. Yet, the promise of untold riches and the expansion of human civilization spurred them onwards, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the boundless expanse of the future.
