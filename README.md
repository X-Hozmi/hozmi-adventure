Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, treacherous rivers demanded careful fording, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the whispered tales of Jerusalem’s sacred city, the chance to witness wonders beyond her village, fueled her onward despite the hardships. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the galaxy was a delicate dance of astrogation and calculated risk, a constant battle against gravitational pulls and unforeseen celestial events.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of her isolation and the monumental task ahead.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of unlocking humanity’s next great leap, spurred her onwards through the cosmic unknown.
