
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in fiery hues.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow her whole, and the endless expanse of the desert tested her resolve at every turn.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ry" Vance piloted the *Starseeker* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her ship's controls. Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a galaxy far beyond the known reaches of human exploration.  The risks were unimaginable – unpredictable gravitational forces, unknown alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, burned brighter than any star in the sky.
