
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onwards, the setting sun painting the dust-choked plains of Aquitaine in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of our laden wagons, each snort from the tired horses, was a testament to the months spent traversing the unforgiving landscape.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease tested our resolve, but the lure of the legendary lost city of Eldoria – whispered to hold unimaginable riches and arcane knowledge – kept our spirits, however flickering, alight.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar exploration, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova guides her crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists, navigators, and engineers, towards the Xylos system, a whispered promise of a new home for humanity.  The journey is fraught with peril;  uncharted nebulae, rogue asteroid fields, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive are just a prelude to the unknowns that await them in a galaxy teeming with both wonder and terrifying possibilities.
