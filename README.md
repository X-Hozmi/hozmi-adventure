
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her and her meager pack.  Her journey across the ravaged landscape of France was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease clung to the air like a shroud, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the whispered promise of a legendary healing herb beyond the Black Mountains spurred her on, a beacon in the bleakness.  Each creak of the saddle, each aching muscle, fueled her determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vibrant nebula of Xylos shimmering outside her viewport.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional methods.  Faster-than-light travel came with its own anxieties – unpredictable wormholes, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the gnawing loneliness of deep space.  But the thrill of exploration, the chance to uncover new worlds and technologies, outweighed the risks.  The cosmos awaited, and Ryla was ready to navigate its uncharted territories.
