
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey across the ravaged French countryside was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the plague stalked the villages, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, from fording swollen rivers to navigating treacherous mountain passes, yet the glint of the promised treasure – a lost relic said to hold immense power – spurred them relentlessly toward their unknown destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a gamble born of desperation and hope.  The journey was a relentless test of endurance, navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms.  But the knowledge that she carried the last hope of a dying world fueled her every action, pushing her and her crew toward the uncharted edge of the cosmos.
