
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, offered little solace against the looming peaks and unpredictable weather.  The whispers of bandits and the rumors of mythical beasts did little to deter her quest; the lost city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable treasures, beckoned her forward, a siren's call against the harsh realities of medieval travel. Each creaking cart wheel, each strained muscle, fueled her determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the jolt barely registering against the hum of the hyperspace drive.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leapt across the vast expanse between galaxies, charting a course through unmapped nebulae and skirting the gravitational pull of black holes.  This wasn't the romanticized exploration of old; it was a perilous dance with the unforgiving physics of the cosmos.  The thrill of discovery, however, burned brighter than any fear, a beacon guiding him through the infinite darkness towards the legendary Xylos system and the potential of untold alien civilizations.
