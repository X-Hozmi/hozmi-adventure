Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the ochre of the earth, squinted at the setting sun.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

The cosmos was a vast and unforgiving ocean, yet the possibility of discovery propelled her onward, a solitary navigator charting a course into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
