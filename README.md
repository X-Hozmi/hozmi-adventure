
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little solace against the looming peaks and unpredictable trails.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down her spine, a reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the familiar.  This journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, promised untold riches – or a swift, brutal end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, relied on Rexx's skill and the ship's antiquated but reliable technology.  Their mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Lyra, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize worth risking everything for.
