
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel, containing little more than dried figs and a well-thumbed map, held the weight of her hopes – to reach Avignon before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed like a phantom. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, each sunset the gnawing anxiety of the unknown, but the spirit of adventure burned bright within her, fuelled by a thirst for the unknown and a destiny she couldn't yet comprehend.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of nebulae, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the enigmatic whispers of alien civilizations.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, each newly discovered planet a testament to human resilience and the boundless curiosity that drove explorers across the vast, glittering expanse of the cosmos.
