
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried rations and a well-thumbed map, a lifeline in this lawless land.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions.  But the whispered legends of a hidden monastery, said to hold ancient secrets, spurred her on, each hard-won mile a testament to her unwavering resolve. This journey was not merely a physical test, it was a test of her spirit, a forging in the crucible of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a dance with gravity wells and rogue asteroids, the vast, inky expanse of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  The advanced technology of her starship provided comfort, but the isolation, the potential dangers lurking in uncharted space, and the sheer scale of the unknown fueled a different kind of adventure, one that tested her courage and ingenuity in the boundless frontier of the cosmos.
