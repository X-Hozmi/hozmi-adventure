
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Ahead stretches the unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of green fields and dark forests concealing dangers both human and beastly. Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Montsegur – is a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens her senses, fueling her determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveys the swirling nebula from the bridge of the 'Starseeker'.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in years of warp travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Facing the unknown, battling cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Jax and her crew must rely on their training, their courage, and their unwavering hope of finding the lost colony – and perhaps, a little piece of themselves, along the way.
