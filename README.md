
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork of weary horses and even wearier men, creaked across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Rumors whispered of bandits lurking in the shadowed canyons, and the endless expanse of desert threatened to swallow us whole. Each sunrise brought renewed hope, a fragile flame against the vastness of the unknown, yet the fear of thirst and the specter of death rode alongside us, as constant companions on our perilous journey.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship humming with the energy of a thousand suns, hurtled towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated through asteroid fields and nebulae shimmering with cosmic dust, her crew a diverse band of explorers facing the unknown with a mixture of apprehension and exhilarating anticipation.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colors and celestial wonders, held both the promise of discovery and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies and the uncharted darkness between the stars.
