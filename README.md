
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched fields, brooding forests, and the occasional spire of a distant monastery.  Her journey to Avignon, to find a rumored cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed glens, treacherous terrain threatened to swallow her whole, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death cast a pall over every village she passed.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but also the thrill of discovery, of pushing beyond the known world, one weary step at a time.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of colors swirling around her ship like cosmic paint. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across multiple moons and planets.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and hallucination, yet the vastness of space, studded with breathtaking wonders and deadly cosmic phenomena, held a potent allure.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery, of contact with a lost civilization, fueled her unwavering spirit.
