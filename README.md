
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of a powerful healing herb.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in the face of such a noble goal.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to push further, fuelled by hope and a gnawing fear of failure.  He carried with him not just a map, but the weight of his family's prayers and the possibility of a miracle.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of the swirling nebula.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unknown space.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the threat of pirate attacks, and the ever-present fear of encountering hostile alien lifeforms were the realities of interstellar travel.  But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fragmented civilization, pushed her ever onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the vast, uncharted territories of the cosmos.
