
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her horse picks its way through the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised sky, a daunting barrier on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors whispered in taverns of hidden oases and treacherous bandits fuel her determination, a potent mix with the gnawing fear of the unknown. Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious merchants, and evading the relentless gaze of rival knights.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and deciphering ancient alien technology keeps her crew on the edge of their seats.  The vastness of space offers a breathtaking, awe-inspiring vista, but it also harbors unseen dangers that could end their voyage before it’s even begun.
