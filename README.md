
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in the form of rare spices, a clandestine message for a rebel lord, and the weight of a thousand whispered prayers for safe passage.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, disease, or worse – the wrath of the Inquisition, should her illicit cargo be discovered. Her journey, a perilous thread weaving through the tapestry of a warring kingdom, was far from over.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet teeming with untold possibilities, but also fraught with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal mistress, warping time and space, and the crew faced the constant threat of spatial anomalies and pirate raids.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to chart new worlds and uncover alien civilizations, far outweighed the risks for Eva and her intrepid crew, bound together by a shared thirst for the unknown across the vast, star-dusted canvas of the galaxy.
