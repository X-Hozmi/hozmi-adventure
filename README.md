
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious map promising a lost city whispered to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown, yet the unwavering hope of finding the cure pushed her onward, past crumbling castles and through whispering forests, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a colony possessing advanced technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr cruisers, Ryla relied on her wits and the unwavering loyalty of her crew, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each alien system a potential graveyard. The vastness of space, while terrifying, held the same promise of discovery and salvation that had driven Elara centuries before.
