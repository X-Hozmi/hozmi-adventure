
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel bulging with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was perilous, fraught with the ever-present threat of disease, treacherous terrain, and the unpredictable whims of nature, yet the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across lightyears to the Kepler-186f system.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and solar flares; instead of thirst, oxygen deprivation; and instead of disease, the insidious decay of prolonged space travel.  Her mission: to establish a new colony on a potentially habitable planet, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The vast emptiness of space dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscape, yet the human spirit of exploration, of pushing boundaries, remained a constant, bridging the centuries and the cosmos.
