
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of parched earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, or even worse, the lingering dread of unseen disease.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless stride.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting roar against the vast, silent expanse of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, displaying constellations and wormholes, treacherous cosmic currents and the alluring promise of new worlds.  The risks were immense – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present unknown – but the potential rewards, a new home for humanity, were worth the unimaginable journey.
