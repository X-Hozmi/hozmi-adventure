
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and the faded map promising the legendary city of Ys – a whispered rumour among the peasantry, a jewel sought by kings and scholars alike.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled the thrill and the terror of her solitary journey, a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and vibrant gases.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a counterpoint to the quiet determination in her voice as she navigated the treacherous asteroid field.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a prize coveted by countless interstellar corporations and rogue factions alike. The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, the risk of encountering hostile alien life a constant companion to the promise of discovery.
