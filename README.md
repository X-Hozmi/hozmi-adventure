
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, swung against her hip, a constant reminder of the long, arduous journey ahead.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of healing, spurred her onward, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time, but the dangers remained: unpredictable asteroid fields, pirate incursions, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  Her mission, to deliver vital medical supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, was fraught with peril, yet the weight of responsibility fueled her determination to reach her destination, a tiny, life-sustaining planet light-years away.
