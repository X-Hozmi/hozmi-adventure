
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already conquered.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the sea I’d left behind weeks ago.  My destination, the fabled city of Damascus, whispered promises of silks and spices, of scholars and secrets, a journey fraught with the perils of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague. Every sunrise brought fresh challenges, every sunset a hard-won victory, etching this pilgrimage onto my soul.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside, a kaleidoscope of impossible colours, were as breathtaking as they were terrifying.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets and signs of other civilizations.  The risks were immense – uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters. Yet, the lure of discovery, of expanding human knowledge beyond the confines of known space, propelled us forward, towards the infinite darkness and the countless wonders it promised.
