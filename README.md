
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creaking step was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of mythical beasts echoed through the mountains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Every sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, the sting of unfamiliar insects, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of healing fueled her onward, her spirit unbroken by the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions.  The journey, measured in lightyears, was a constant battle against cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space.  Advanced technology mitigated some of the hardship, but the risks were still immense – a single malfunction could mean death in the suffocating emptiness.  Yet, Eva, driven by humanity's relentless push for expansion, steered her ship towards the unknown, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering promise of a new world.
