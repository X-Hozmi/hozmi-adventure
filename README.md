
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the muddy track.  Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Lord Elmsworth, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, rivers swell with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the damp air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for supplies in wary villages, and dodging the suspicious gaze of those who might see them as easy prey.  Their success hinges not only on their courage, but on their ability to read the shifting landscape and the even more unpredictable intentions of men.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of shimmering violet and emerald gases. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets are just a fraction of the dangers she faces.  Alien encounters, both hostile and benevolent, await, and the constant hum of the ship’s engines is a reminder of the immense distances and unforgiving vacuum of space separating her from home.  Her survival – and the fate of the colony – rests upon her skill, her courage, and the unwavering trust in her aging, but reliable, navigation system.
