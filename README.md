The medieval landscape unfolded before him – dense forests whispered secrets of lurking bandits, while craggy peaks clawed at the sky, promising perilous climbs and breathtaking views.

Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would test the limits of her ship, her crew, and her own courage.
