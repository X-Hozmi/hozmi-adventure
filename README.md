
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground as I navigate the treacherous Alpine passes, a meager satchel containing my maps and meager supplies slung across my shoulder.  Each creaking groan of my mule is a testament to the arduous journey ahead, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge.  Wolves howl in the distance, a chilling reminder of the dangers lurking in this untamed wilderness, far from the familiar comfort of my village.  The quest for glory and fortune is a dangerous path, but the allure of the unknown is too strong to resist.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive fills my ears as we jump across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from our own.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport are breathtaking, a canvas of cosmic dust and dying stars. This isn't a journey for gold or glory, but for survival.  Our colony ship, fleeing a dying sun, seeks a new home among the uncharted systems. Each hyperspace jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where hostile alien life and unforeseen gravitational anomalies could mean the end of our fragile hope for a future among the stars.
