
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Her quest – to reach the legendary Abbey of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness – was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested her strength and skill, and the biting wind threatened to freeze her to the bone.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering hope for healing spurred her further across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Vance piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of incandescent gas, its colors shimmering like a cosmic oil painting. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient star charts were all in a day's work for Nova and her crew.  The vast emptiness of space held its own brand of terror, but the promise of rediscovering a lost civilization fueled their relentless journey across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
