
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled in the Whisperwind Mountains, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of ancient magic and breathtaking landscapes spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to tear apart her ship, and pirate fleets lurked in the shadows between systems.  But the promise of life, the hope for a distant world clinging to survival, fueled her determination across the breathtaking, impossibly vast expanse of the cosmos.
