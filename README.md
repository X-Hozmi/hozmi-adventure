
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience; navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in hushed tones, and relying on the kindness (or coercion) of strangers.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding an ancient cure, was a gamble against the odds, a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the capricious gravity wells of dying stars, she relied on cutting-edge technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  Unlike Elara's journey, dangers were less visceral, more subtle – the insidious creep of radiation, the silent failure of a vital system, the potential betrayal of an unscrupulous alliance.  Yet the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, burned just as fiercely in Eva's heart as it had in Elara's.
