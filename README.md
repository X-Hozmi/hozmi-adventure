Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks had bled into months since he'd left the familiar comfort of his kingdom, his quest for the legendary Sunstone leading him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the whispering shadows of forgotten ruins.

Captain Eva Rostova, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebula outside her viewport, charted a course through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy.

Each jump into hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the promise of new worlds, new civilizations—and perhaps, the key to unlocking the galaxy's deepest secrets – or facing its most terrifying threats.
