
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need to escape a failing harvest, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable rains, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle for survival, each night a testament to the unwavering human spirit pushing towards a distant hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and untold dangers.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, mapping a course through asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes. The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, was also terrifying in its indifference.  The weight of her crew's lives, and the fate of a lost civilization, rested on her shoulders, a burden light years away from the medieval pilgrim's simpler, yet equally perilous, path.
