
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel contains a king's ransom in spices, a perilous trade that takes her far from her village.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispers of a mythical city lost to time tempt her further into the unforgiving wilderness. Each sunrise brings new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious merchants, and facing the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  The reward, however, is the thrill of the unknown, the satisfaction of pushing past her limits, and the possibility of untold riches.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, "Stardust Drifter."  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel.  The vastness of space is a terrifying beauty, filled with unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the constant hum of unknown energy fields.  Her crew, a motley band of explorers and scientists, face the challenges of navigating complex gravitational pulls, repairing life-support systems under pressure, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  The potential rewards, however, are limitless: a new home for humanity, the discovery of advanced technology, and the understanding of the universe itself.
