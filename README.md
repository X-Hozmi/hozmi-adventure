
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest was proving more perilous than any battlefield.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks,  while the path itself was a labyrinth of hidden ravines and treacherous bogs.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of starvation or ambush, yet the promise of reaching the distant King's court, and the reward awaiting him, kept him pressing on.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, a testament to his unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a symphony of complex calculations and hyperspace jumps, a stark contrast to Reginald's simpler map.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, potentially leading to uncharted systems teeming with life or the cold void of interstellar space.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced the challenges of asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, bound together by a shared thirst for discovery and the allure of the unexplored galaxy.
