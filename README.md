He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, a promise of fortune and perhaps even glory clutched within its faded lines.  His journey – a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Eldoria – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and into dark, whispering forests where ancient myths held sway. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape and its dangers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers in their battered freighters, and battling the crippling effects of hyperspace travel were all in a day’s work. The vastness of space, a terrifying and wondrous canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, held both incredible beauty and unimaginable peril for those who dared to traverse its depths.
