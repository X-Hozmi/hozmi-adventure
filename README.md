
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains fiery red.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the map leading to the lost city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the perils and possibilities that lie ahead on her perilous journey across the untamed lands.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a comforting counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness outside, a stark reminder of the immense distances and the unpredictable dangers of interstellar travel.  With a crew of seasoned explorers at her side, Ryla faces the challenges of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering unknown alien lifeforms, all in pursuit of a new home for humanity among the stars.
