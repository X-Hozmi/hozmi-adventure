
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through the Ardennes, a tapestry of mud, rock, and looming forests.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed glens, swollen rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and power, fueled his relentless journey, a testament to the enduring human spirit's thirst for the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hummed, a counterpoint to the silence of deep space.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the far-flung human colonies and the enigmatic K'tharr Empire, a journey fraught with the perils of hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of the galaxy stretched before her, a testament to humanity's relentless expansion into the unknown.
