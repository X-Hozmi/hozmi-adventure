
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the ancient track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and potent magic.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown, a true test of their courage and endurance.

Centuries later, in the year 2742, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Starseeker' through a nebula of iridescent gas, the vastness of the Andromeda galaxy stretching before them. Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of warp-core malfunctions were just part of their routine.  The adventure, however, lay not just in the dangers of space travel, but in the potential discovery of new life, new civilizations, and the untold mysteries waiting on that distant world.  The galaxy was their playground, a canvas painted with infinite possibilities.
