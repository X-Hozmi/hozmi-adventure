
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked tracks as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel. The promise of glory, however, fueled his journey, pushing him across vast, unforgiving landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with perils unseen.  Unstable wormholes, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a terrifying dance with fate. But the boundless expanse of space, teeming with the mystery of uncharted worlds, spurred her onwards, a modern-day adventurer charting a course across the galactic tapestry.
