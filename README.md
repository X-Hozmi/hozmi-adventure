
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, spurred his weary steed onward.  The trail was treacherous, a ribbon of mud snaking through the dense Black Forest.  Each rustle in the undergrowth promised bandits or worse – mythical beasts whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  He pressed on, driven by hope and a desperate need to save his people, the dangers of the journey a small price to pay for even a sliver of a chance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially habitable for humanity.  The journey was measured in light-years, each jump a gamble against malfunctioning warp drives and unknown celestial phenomena.  Pirates lurked in the shadows of asteroid fields, while the sheer vastness of space itself posed a constant threat.  Yet, Eva pressed on, driven by the same human spirit that had propelled Sir Reginald centuries before – a yearning for discovery and the unwavering hope of a better future, even amidst the daunting perils of the cosmos.
