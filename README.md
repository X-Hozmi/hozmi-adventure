
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey from the bustling port city of Marseille to the fabled Silk Road was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, each sunrise brought the promise of new sights, the thrill of navigating unfamiliar terrains, and the tantalizing hope of reaching the exotic markets of the East, laden with riches beyond her wildest dreams.  The whispered tales of legendary cities and mythical creatures fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Alcubierre drive a constant lullaby against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic wonders.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the celestial tapestry of stars and dying suns.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, Eva faced a different kind of peril – the unknown, the potential for catastrophic equipment failure light years from any rescue, and the profound isolation of traversing the vast emptiness between worlds. The ultimate reward, however, remained the same: the discovery of something new, something extraordinary.
