
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward, the rough track barely discernible beneath the relentless autumn rain.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume his resolve.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation, the whispered legends of Eldoria’s miraculous healing springs, fueled his journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable cosmic storms, Eva and her crew faced dangers far removed from the medieval knight's struggles but equally perilous.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of lure – a promise of discovery and unimaginable wonders beyond the reach of any earthly king.
