
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s retinue as they trudged across the sun-baked plains, the distant Pyrenees shimmering in the heat haze.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their determination forged in the crucible of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faint gravitational whispers of a distant, uncharted planet.  The galaxy stretched before them, a tapestry of vibrant colours and unimaginable wonders, but also a canvas of dangers.  Piratical raiders, rogue asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps all threatened their mission – a desperate search for a new habitable world for humanity, fleeing a dying Earth.  The cosmos offered boundless opportunity, but demanded a price paid in courage and cunning.
