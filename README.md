
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald’s worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the crashing waves.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on his perilous journey, but the whispered promise of ancient magic and untold riches keeps him pushing onward, each sunrise a renewed gamble against the odds.  He carries a map, tattered and incomplete, a compass that spins wildly in the magnetic storms, and a heart full of both hope and fear.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden spacetime anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and braving the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, Eva relies on cutting-edge technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew. The vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, but the possibility of finding survivors, of uncovering the mystery of Kepler-186f, fuels her relentless pursuit across the galaxy.
