
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the pass, the wind whipping at their worn cloaks.  Their journey across the blighted lands of Albion had been arduous, fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten knowledge and untold riches, spurred them onward. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate, but the allure of adventure, the promise of glory, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her starship, 'Stardust'.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and brimming with the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering strange and wondrous alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, was simply the price of exploration.  The cosmos held secrets beyond imagining, and Elara, driven by an insatiable thirst for discovery, was ready to stake her life on finding them.
