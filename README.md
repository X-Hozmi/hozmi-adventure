
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his weary steed onward.  The dusty track stretched before him, a ribbon of brown cutting through the endless green fields of Mercia.  His quest: to recover the stolen Orb of Aethelred, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching Northmen.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, reminding him of the dangers that lurked in every shadow of this medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the psychic storms that threatened to rip her ship apart. The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable dangers, a far cry from the familiar dangers of Reginald's medieval world, yet equally thrilling.
