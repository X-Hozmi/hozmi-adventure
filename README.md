
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious map leading to a rumored monastery holding ancient healing herbs – the only hope for her plague-stricken village.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down her spine, the wildness of the untamed land a constant, palpable threat alongside the ever-present danger of bandits and disease.  Her journey was a desperate gamble, a test of endurance against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling brilliance of distant stars, held a different kind of peril.  Asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown space anomalies demanded constant vigilance and unwavering skill.  Eva's adventure wasn't about treasure or herbs; it was about the relentless human pursuit of knowledge and the boundless potential of the cosmos.
