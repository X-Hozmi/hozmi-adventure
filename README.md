
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tightly.  The scent of thyme and rosemary couldn't mask the ever-present fear: bandits, disease, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant threats.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Alexandria and deliver a vital message to a long-lost relative, pushed her onward, each creak of the saddle a reminder of the miles yet to endure.  The vastness of the unknown stretched before her, a tapestry woven with hope, danger, and the intoxicating allure of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown regions of the galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and return its scattered inhabitants to known space.  Across light-years and perilous asteroid fields, Ryla charted a course, guided by faint signals and the unwavering hope of finding a forgotten people and bringing them home. The cosmos was their battlefield, the stars their guideposts on a journey beyond imagination.
