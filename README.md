
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Sernin, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of healing fueled her onward, transforming the arduous journey into a thrilling, if desperate, adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with danger – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the constant threat of engine failure. But Eva, hardened by years of spacefaring, pressed on, driven by the allure of discovery and the promise of a future powered by the crystal's boundless energy.
