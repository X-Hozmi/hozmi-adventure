
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the warm promise of the rumored emerald city whispered about in taverns.  His quest, to retrieve a stolen relic, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of forgotten forests, each step fraught with peril from both nature and the thieving brigands who stalked the land.  Companions had fallen, supplies dwindled, but the glint of the emerald city, a shimmering mirage on the horizon, fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter.'  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, had been fraught with unexpected solar flares and near-misses with rogue asteroids.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms and the constant pressure of dwindling fuel reserves.  Yet, the promise of a new beginning, the chance to establish a foothold on a habitable planet light years from Earth, spurred them onward through the inky blackness of space, their ship a tiny, fragile beacon against the vastness of the cosmos.
