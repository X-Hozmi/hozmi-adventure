
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the treacherous Baron Volkov, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, keeps him on edge, his senses sharpened by the constant danger, a stark contrast to the tales of courtly life he left behind.  Survival is the ultimate adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, pushing the ship's warp drive to its limits.  Ahead lies the fabled planet of Aerilon, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  But the void is a dangerous place, haunted by rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, the unknown, is both terrifying and exhilarating, a relentless adventure played out amongst the stars.
