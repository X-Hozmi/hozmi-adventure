
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her roughspun tunic.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the endless plains offered little respite from the scorching sun. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit, her destination a beacon in the vast, unpredictable expanse of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship cutting a path through swirling cosmic dust.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was measured not in days, but in years of hyperspace travel, a relentless hum of the engines a constant companion.  His mission, a vital trade run for the Galactic Consortium, was fraught with hazards unlike any medieval traveler could imagine: asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of subspace anomalies. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, fueled his ambition, making the perilous voyage a thrilling pursuit.
