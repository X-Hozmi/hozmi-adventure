
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and impending storm thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map promising a hidden monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of plague were less daunting than the possibility of failure – the weight of her family's hopes resting on her shoulders.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of bridging the expanding universe.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and facing the existential dread of interstellar travel, Ryla relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering courage.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held as many dangers as the medieval plains, demanding a similar blend of bravery, ingenuity, and relentless hope.
