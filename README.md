
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she journeyed across the unforgiving plains of Francia, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of her worn wagon wheels was a testament to the miles already conquered, a counterpoint to the uncertainty that lay ahead.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the burning desire to find her lost brother fueled her onward,  a flickering candle against the vast, dark expanse of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Nebulae swirled around them, a cosmic canvas of vibrant colours unseen by earthly eyes.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with perils – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions – but the promise of galactic exploration, of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets, propelled them further into the inky black, a beacon of hope against the infinite void.
