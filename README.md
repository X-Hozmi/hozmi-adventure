
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of El Dorado, rumored to shimmer with gold and untold riches.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every arduous mile, her resolve strengthens, fueled by whispers of fortune and the burning desire for adventure beyond her village walls.  

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the uncharted star systems after a catastrophic hyperspace jump.  Alien landscapes, hostile ecosystems, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes present daily perils.  But the allure of discovery and the hope of reuniting lost families far outweigh the risks.  The vastness of space becomes a canvas for his courage, each jump a gamble, each new planet a testament to the boundless possibilities of interstellar travel.
