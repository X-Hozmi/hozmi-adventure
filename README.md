
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, bounced against her hip. This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air. Yet, with each creaking step, her heart swelled with the thrill of the unknown, the ancient paths beckoning her toward a sacred goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating hum of the hyperdrive.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with its own dangers.  Unstable wormholes, pirate fleets lurking in asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations were just some of the challenges awaiting them.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries into the vast cosmic ocean, outweighed any fear.
