
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her and her meager supplies.  Her journey across the blistered plains of Castile was far from the romantic tales told in taverns.  Each day brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present ache in her weary bones.  Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, a place of untold riches and magic, pushed her onward, fueled by a desperate hope that outweighed the crushing weight of the reality around her.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'. Unlike Elara's arduous land journey, his involved the smooth hum of advanced technology and the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos.  Yet, the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump between galaxies a gamble.  But the lure of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's greatest mystery, was a beacon in the infinite darkness, a promise of discovery that eclipsed any risk.
