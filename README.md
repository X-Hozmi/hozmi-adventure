
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, rivers swelled dangerously with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in isolated villages, and weathering storms that threatened to sweep them from their mounts.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve hardened, fueled by faith and the allure of the distant shrine.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  Faster-than-light travel strained the ship's systems, and loneliness gnawed at the crew's morale.  But the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, the discovery of new star systems, and the unwavering hope of finding a new home spurred them on across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
