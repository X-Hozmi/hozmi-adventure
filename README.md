
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a hand-drawn map promising the legendary lost city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold secrets and unimaginable riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were only some of the challenges that lay between her and her destiny, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a prayer.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumoured to harbor sentient life.  The jump through hyperspace was always a gamble, a terrifying plunge into the unknown, but the lure of first contact and the potential for galactic discovery outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her as she navigated asteroid fields and charted unknown constellations, forever pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
