
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a rumored lost city, its location whispered only in hushed tones among wandering scholars. Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey, yet the allure of discovery fueled her onward. Each sunrise revealed new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience in the face of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in the starship *Stardust*.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy and seek out habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel masked the immense distances, but cosmic storms and rogue asteroids posed a constant threat.  The vast emptiness between worlds held both terrifying beauty and the promise of a future, a future dependent on Jax's courage and the *Stardust's* resilience in the face of the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.
