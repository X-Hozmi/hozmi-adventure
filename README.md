
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – a phantom sickness whispered about in hushed tones at every roadside inn. Yet, the allure of the fabled City of Whispers, said to hold the secrets of ancient magic, spurred her onward, a tiny speck against the vastness of the medieval world.  Her adventure was a gamble against the odds, a test of endurance and courage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson hues painting the bridge in ethereal light.  Their mission: to recover a lost artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star lightyears from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling spatial anomalies was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unknown dangers lurking on the planet itself –  alien flora, hostile indigenous life, or perhaps the ghost of the miners themselves, trapped in a timeless loop of despair. The vastness of space offered boundless opportunities, but also the cold, unforgiving reality of cosmic isolation.
