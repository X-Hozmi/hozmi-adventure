
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bit at Sir Kaelan's face as he urged his weary steed onward, the rutted track barely visible beneath the late autumn mud.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the treacherous Baron Malvoisin, led him through dense forests haunted by whispers of goblins and across windswept moors where wolves howled under a blood-red moon. Each day brought fresh dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed ravines, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of the stolen jewel, imagined in his mind, fueled his relentless journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the journey was far from smooth.  Hyperdrive malfunctions, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies tested her crew’s mettle.  But the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the colony's disappearance, spurred them onward through the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
