
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  Ahead lay the unknown: the whispered-of city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, of proving himself a worthy knight, fueled his weary limbs. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new hope for reaching the fabled oasis.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's reach across the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new home, was imminent; a breathtaking leap across light-years, a gamble against the unforgiving void.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, held their breath, their hopes and fears mirrored in the shimmering nebulae outside. The vastness of space offered untold wonders, but also the chilling prospect of encountering alien life, or worse, encountering the silent emptiness of a failed expedition.
