
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fueled his journey, driving him across kingdoms and through unforgiving landscapes, a lone knight against the vast and unpredictable medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of preventing a galactic-wide famine.  Warp jumps brought her across light-years in an instant, yet each jump held a risk of encountering hostile pirate fleets or encountering uncharted celestial anomalies.  Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed on, her courage a beacon in the boundless darkness of the cosmos.
