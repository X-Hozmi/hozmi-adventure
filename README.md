
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a renewed test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with strange flora and potentially hostile lifeforms.  The vastness of space, with its breathtaking beauty and unpredictable dangers, was a far cry from the medieval trails Elara had traversed, yet the spirit of adventure – the thrill of the unknown, the unwavering pursuit of a vital goal – burned just as fiercely within Nova's heart.
