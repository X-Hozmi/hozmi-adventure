
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of orange and blood.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of its shimmering spires and untold riches spurred her onward, each hardship fueling her fierce determination to reach her destination.  The worn map in her satchel, its edges frayed and stained with sweat, was her only guide through this untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Warp drives hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic pulse of the ship's life support. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel-like planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The journey, a perilous voyage across light-years of uncharted space, held the potential for unimaginable wonders – and catastrophic failure.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown, was prepared to face any challenge the galaxy threw her way.
