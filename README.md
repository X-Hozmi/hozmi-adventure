
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – bandits, a lost monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, or perhaps a chance encounter with a wandering scholar.  The map, a faded parchment clutched in her calloused hand, was her only guide across the perilous landscape, promising riches and knowledge beyond the familiar confines of her village.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the quiet thrill of the unknown – alien lifeforms, uncharted star systems, and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on a future where humanity might thrive among the stars, or be lost in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
