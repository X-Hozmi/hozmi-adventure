
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward. The scent of pine and damp earth fought with the stench of decaying vegetation, a constant reminder of the plague's devastating march across Europe.  Her quest, to reach the rumored monastery sheltering a cure, pushed her relentlessly across treacherous mountain passes and through lawless forests.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadows, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of whether her destination even existed.  Yet, the flicker of hope, fuelled by whispered tales of healing, sustained her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a cosmic kaleidoscope of impossible colours.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potentially life-saving flora.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political tensions between the galactic empires vying for control of Kepler-186f. Ryla, a veteran smuggler with a reputation for daring, knew this was more than a simple retrieval mission; it was a gamble with the fate of entire star systems hanging in the balance.
