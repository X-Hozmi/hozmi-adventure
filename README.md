
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming under the unforgiving sun, led his small company across the dusty plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation and thirst.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their weary steps, turning every hardship into a step closer to their ultimate goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unknown space anomalies tested her skill and courage, but the thought of the colonists relying on her kept her focused.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless wonders and dangers, making every jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.
