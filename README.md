He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing the route to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse, the cursed swamps said to swallow men whole.  His journey was a gamble, a desperate hope against the grim realities of a life spent in poverty, but the lure of adventure, of a different fate, spurred him on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating; the ship's AI hummed a constant, reassuring drone against the silent immensity.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, potentially fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, rogue space anomalies, or even hostile alien encounters. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, fuelled her unwavering determination to push the boundaries of human exploration.
