
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the sprawling landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had been arduous.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested her resolve.  Yet, the glint of gold rumored to be held within the city's walls, and the chance to escape her village's poverty, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each sunset a testament to her growing resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, with unpredictable spacetime distortions and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation.  The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to Elara's rugged terrain, was a different kind of lonely; a silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling of her comms system.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries further than ever before, fueled her onward, a kindred spirit to Elara across the vast gulf of time.
