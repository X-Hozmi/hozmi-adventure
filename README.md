
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city of gold, guarded by mythical beasts and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, fueled both his fear and his burning ambition.  Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving landscape itself posed constant threats, but the lure of Eldoria, the promise of untold riches and glory, propelled him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey wasn't about gold or glory, but about survival and the relentless pursuit of a new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure were commonplace hazards. But  the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the hope of finding a new beginning among the stars, fuelled her unwavering determination.
