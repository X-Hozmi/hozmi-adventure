
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of Eldoria, the chance to rewrite his family's impoverished fate, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies were all in a day's work for this seasoned spacefarer. The allure of discovery, the hope of finding new life and resources for a starving Earth, propelled her and her crew through the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space. The hum of the hyperdrive was her constant companion, a promise of both the wonder and the danger that lay ahead.
