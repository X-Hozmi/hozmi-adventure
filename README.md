
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed. The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray I'd left behind weeks ago in coastal Brittany.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  My meager supplies – a half-eaten loaf, a waterskin, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between me and whatever dangers lurked in the shadows of ancient trees and crumbling castles.  This journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding the key to my family's past, felt more perilous with each passing day.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Gazing from the observation deck, I watched nebulae swirl in vibrant hues across the void, a breathtaking panorama far exceeding any earthly vista.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of an ancient civilization.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy had been fraught with its own dangers – asteroid fields, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirates.  But the allure of uncovering lost knowledge, of bridging the vast chasm between civilizations, outweighed the risk.  The cosmos, in its infinite vastness, held secrets more compelling than any earthly treasure.
