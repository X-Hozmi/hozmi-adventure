
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each day brought its own perils – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the wilderness, spurred them on, their resolve hardened by shared hardship and a flickering ember of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship the 'Stardust Wanderer' a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the journey was far from effortless.  Warp storms threatened to tear the ship apart, alien scavengers lurked in the void, and the psychological toll of isolation in the vast emptiness of space tested the crew’s limits.  Yet, the possibility of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f, fueled their intrepid journey.
