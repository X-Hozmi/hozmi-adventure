
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she traverses the unforgiving Provençal landscape.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother fuels her onward, transforming every hardship into a step closer to salvation, a testament to the enduring human spirit against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Starfall" Valerius navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble dragonfly against the backdrop of a million suns.  Her mission: to deliver vital nanite repair units to a remote colony struggling against a devastating solar flare.  Faster-than-light travel brings its own dangers – unpredictable spatial distortions, pirate raids, and the ever-present risk of engine failure in the unforgiving void.  But the promise of life saved, a galaxy-spanning lifeline to a distant world, is a reward worth risking everything for.
