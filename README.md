
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône Valley.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown verges, heightened the tension of her solitary journey.  She clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, guiding her towards rumored healing waters beyond the haunted Black Forest.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the promise of a cure for her ailing brother spurred her onward, a flickering ember in the encroaching darkness.  The road, a ribbon of mud and hope, stretched before her, a testament to the unwavering human spirit against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, masking the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unpredictable spatial anomalies.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, relied on him – on his skill, his cunning, and his unwavering resolve.  The vast emptiness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, presented challenges far exceeding any medieval journey, yet the allure of discovery burned as brightly as any earthly quest.
