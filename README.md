
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salt spray clinging to our roughspun tunics as we set sail for the Holy Land.  Weeks bled into months, the relentless sun baking our skin as we traversed the Mediterranean, then the treacherous land routes through the Levant.  We dodged bandits in the shadow of crumbling castles, bartered for supplies in dusty marketplaces, and slept under a sky thick with stars, ever watchful for the whispers of approaching danger. Each day brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new brush with the unknown – a true medieval adventure.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  Our vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across light-years, traversing the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. We're explorers, charting unmapped nebulae and making first contact with alien civilizations, each encounter a gamble between thrilling discovery and unforeseen peril.  The hum of the hyperdrive is the soundtrack to our journey, a constant reminder of the breathtaking distance we cover and the breathtaking wonders that await us.
