
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, pinned to a desperate journey to find her brother, lost amidst the sprawling chaos of the Hundred Years' War. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the glint of distant towers spurred her on, a beacon in the fading light promising either salvation or despair.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a perilous undertaking involving uncharted wormholes and potentially hostile alien life.  The thrill of exploration warred with the ever-present threat of malfunctioning hyperdrives and unknown celestial anomalies. Yet, the vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, fuelled her intrepid spirit, reminding her of the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the familiar confines of her home galaxy.
