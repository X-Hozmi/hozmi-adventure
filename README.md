
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their arduous journey across the vast and unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant Xylan Empire, a journey spanning light years and fraught with peril.  Navigation through asteroid fields, encounters with unknown alien species, and the constant threat of engine failure tested her crew's skills and courage. But the promise of interstellar commerce, and the chance to forge a new era of galactic peace, spurred them onward across the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
