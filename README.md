
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of sun-drenched lands and opulent cities far to the east. His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, tempered by the grim reality of the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and demanding courage beyond measure.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment failure.  Yet, the lure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
