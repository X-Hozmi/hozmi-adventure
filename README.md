
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales of spice and silk he'd heard from returning traders.  His journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by both faith and avarice, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the very air seemed thick with the whispers of disease.  Yet, with each sunrise, the promise of distant lands spurred him onward, a stubborn ember in the chilling landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The hyperdrive hummed, a low thrum that vibrated through her bones as they jumped between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the distant shimmer of nebulae, held a different kind of peril – unforeseen gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of the unknown, the chance to rewrite the history of interstellar travel, propelled her forward, a lone star charting a course through the cosmic ocean.
