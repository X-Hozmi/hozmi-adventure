
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous, bandit-infested Black Forest had been brutal.  Each dawn brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and constantly scanning the horizon for the telltale glint of enemy armor.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred him relentlessly forward.  The thrill of the unknown, the clash of steel, and the possibility of glory fueled his every step.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant test of skill and nerves.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant stars, both awed and terrified her. Yet, the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories in the cosmos, and adding another pin to the map of the galaxy surpassed any fear.  The universe was her playground, and the adventure was only just beginning.
