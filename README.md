
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Survival meant trusting her instincts, her worn map, and the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers encountered along the perilous path to the mythical healer's valley.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The challenges weren't bandits or blizzards, but rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of the cosmos.  Success depended on her crew's skill, her ship's resilience, and a healthy dose of luck in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
