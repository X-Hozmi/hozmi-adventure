
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees, said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each flickering campfire represented a fleeting moment of respite in a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her determination, however, burned brighter than any fire.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers was a daily reality.  Yet, the breathtaking cosmic vistas and the promise of groundbreaking discovery fueled her and her crew, pushing them ever closer to the edge of the known galaxy and the potential to rewrite the future of interstellar travel.
