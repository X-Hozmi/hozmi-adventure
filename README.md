
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal landscape.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a parchment map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby scrub, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death were ever-present. Yet, the lure of the unknown, of pushing beyond the familiar boundaries of her village, burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Unlike Elara's journey, hers was measured in light-years, not leagues.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions preying on interstellar trade routes.  But the spirit of adventure, the human drive to explore the vast unknown, remained a constant, echoing across time and space.
