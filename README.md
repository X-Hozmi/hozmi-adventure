
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Elara's caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wagon wheels a counterpoint to the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer in some forgotten village.  Their journey, a perilous pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had already claimed several companions to sickness and banditry.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, fordable rivers that swelled unpredictably, and the ever-present threat of marauders lurking in the shadows of ancient forests. Yet, the promise of Jerusalem, and the shared camaraderie born of hardship, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but the destination planet, Kepler-186f, remained shrouded in mystery.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the colonized sectors of the Milky Way, faced the unknown with a mixture of apprehension and excitement.  The allure of charting new worlds, discovering new life, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweighed the risks of interstellar travel, even the potential encounters with uncharted dangers.
