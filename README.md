
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide through the treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine – bandit raids were as common as the rocky terrain. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the ship’s AI, HALIX, calmly reporting the jump coordinates to the next unexplored system.  Across the vast expanse of the cockpit's holographic display, galaxies spiralled in breathtaking majesty, a far cry from the dusty trails of Elara's journey.  The thrill, however, remained the same: the unknown beckoned, promising untold riches and unimaginable dangers – perhaps a new habitable planet, perhaps a devastating encounter with a hostile alien race. The universe was their playground, and the stakes were infinitely higher.
