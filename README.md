
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as her weary horse picks its way across the parched, sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of untold riches and ancient magic fuel her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, harsh weather, and the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a hard-earned victory against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets is a daily routine.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vast emptiness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the boundless unknown and the immense risks – and rewards – of exploration far beyond humanity's reach.
