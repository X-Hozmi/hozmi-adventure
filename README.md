
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the midday heat, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude – had led him across treacherous mountain passes, through bandit-infested forests, and across scorching plains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: the threat of ambush, dwindling supplies, and the gnawing uncertainty of his success.  Yet, the allure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onward, a knight errant pursuing glory and redemption.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare isotope crucial to sustaining life on Kepler-186f.  Vast distances and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies were merely inconveniences compared to the political maneuvering and corporate espionage she faced.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became routine as she traversed the galaxy, the cold vacuum of space a constant reminder of her isolation and the immense scale of her endeavor.  The final jump to Kepler-186f held the promise of salvation or annihilation – the ultimate test of a seasoned spacefarer.
