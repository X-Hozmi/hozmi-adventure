
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to have joined a mercenary company far to the east.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance at the looming shadows of the mountains, fueled the adventure, a risky journey across kingdoms and treacherous passes, where bandits lurked and storms could swallow a traveler whole.  The whispers of ancient ruins and forgotten magic only added to the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Jaxx piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting his ship's viewport in breathtaking hues.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against the unforgiving void of space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a calculated risk against asteroid fields and rogue gravitational pulls.  The vastness of the cosmos, teeming with uncharted planets and alien civilizations, both terrified and exhilarated him. The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the dangers.
