
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and horse sweat clinging to her.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed her like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching her destination, a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, but also the grim reality of another day's perilous travel across unforgiving terrain.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her destination a nebula teeming with unexplored planets light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and corporate espionage she faced.  The lure of new discoveries and untold riches was a powerful siren song, but the vastness of space held equal measures of wonder and danger.  A single malfunction could mean the end of the mission, or worse, the end of her crew.  The cosmos stretched before them, an endless tapestry of opportunity and peril.
