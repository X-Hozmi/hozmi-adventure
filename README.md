
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and steeled their resolve against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades prior.  Navigating through uncharted star systems, dodging asteroid fields, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva.  The vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos was a constant companion to the ever-present danger, a stark reminder of the incredible risks and immeasurable rewards of interstellar travel.
