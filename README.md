
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by goblins and worse, a necessary passage to reach the distant kingdom of Eldoria and claim his birthright.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a thrill of both fear and anticipation through him.  He carried with him not only his sword but also the hopes of his family, a map frayed at the edges, and a heart full of unwavering determination to overcome the perils that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the resources to save her dying colony.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vista of cosmic wonders visible through the viewport.  The dangers were different now—radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders—but the thrill of exploration, the unwavering drive to reach her goal, burned as brightly as ever.
