The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a forest primeval, shadows lengthening ominously as the sun dipped below the horizon.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's fatal illness.

The vast distances, the unpredictable celestial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made the voyage an agonizingly slow but exhilarating adventure, the fate of her home planet hanging in the balance.
