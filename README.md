
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He’d traded his family’s meager harvest for passage with a grizzled caravan heading east, a journey whispered to hold the secret of a lost city shimmering with gold.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, brought a prickle of fear and a surge of exhilaration.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on this desperate gamble for fortune and escape.

Centuries later,  Jax's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond charted space, a planet rumored to hold the key to solving the intergalactic famine gripping the human colonies.  While facing less immediate physical peril than Thomas, Jax battled isolation, the constant hum of the hyperdrive, and the ever-present dread of encountering the unknown – hostile alien lifeforms, rogue asteroid fields, or the sheer, infinite vastness of space itself.  The reward, however, was the potential salvation of billions.
