
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies – it held the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and wonder; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on this perilous quest across the uncharted lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines. Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the promise of discovery and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies lurking just beyond the reach of her sensors.
