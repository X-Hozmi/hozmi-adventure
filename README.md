
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and untold magic, guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the glory that awaited its discoverer, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less perilous.  Warp-core fluctuations threatened to tear the ship apart, rogue asteroids loomed like monstrous space-faring krakens, and the vast emptiness of space pressed upon them, a constant reminder of their isolation.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, held firm, her gaze fixed on the distant promise of a new world.
