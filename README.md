
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn leather boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in fiery hues. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the insidious plague itself.  Each day was a gamble, a test of his courage and resilience against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertain future.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust', its sleek hull a silver needle piercing the inky blackness of space. Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies in search of habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of encountering hostile alien species were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, dwarfed the challenges of medieval travel, but the human spirit's thirst for discovery remained a constant, pushing Eva and her crew towards the uncharted corners of the cosmos.
