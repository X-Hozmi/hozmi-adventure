
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the sun bleaching the harsh landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising untold riches in the East.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, lawless territories ruled by warring factions, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Yet, the whisper of silk, spices, and unimaginable treasures fuelled her onward, a relentless thrum against the rhythmic clop of hooves on stone. This was her adventure, a pilgrimage across a continent, a gamble against the odds.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting lullaby against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Ahead lay the challenges of navigating unpredictable wormholes, the possibility of encountering alien life – both benevolent and hostile – and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions light-years from any rescue. Yet the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity's reach, was a potent fuel, burning bright against the cold darkness of the void.
