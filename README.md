
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the precarious balance between life and death on her arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's shimmering veil.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia for slower vessels.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and cosmic wonders, held both the promise of new worlds and the chilling uncertainty of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, civilizations.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
