
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  His journey had already taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and through dark forests where the shadows seemed to writhe with unseen things.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the lure of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in his mind, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, lost amidst the swirling chaos of a newly discovered wormhole.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Navigation through asteroid fields was a constant battle against time and technology, the risk of encountering hostile alien life a chilling reality. But Eva, driven by a sense of duty and the faint hope of rescue, pressed onward, a tiny speck of humanity in the immensity of the cosmos.
