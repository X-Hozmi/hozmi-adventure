
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for adventure – or peril. Bandits roamed these desolate lands, and rumors of mythical creatures whispered in hushed tones around crackling campfires.  Her quest, to deliver a sacred relic to a distant monastery, was fraught with hardship, but the promise of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a lone figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with a different kind of anticipation.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was perilous; navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates were commonplace hazards. Yet, the potential reward – the unlocking of interstellar travel for humanity – overshadowed the risks.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held infinite possibilities, and Eva, at the helm of her ship, was ready to explore them.
