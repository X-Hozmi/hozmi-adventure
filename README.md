
Sir Gareth, his surcoat dusty and his pack heavy, spurred his destrier onwards.  The midday sun beat down on the rutted track winding through the Ardennes forest, a far cry from the welcoming taverns of his hometown.  His quest, to recover the stolen relic of St. Fiacre, led him deeper into the unknown, through whispering woods haunted by rumour and shadowed by the brooding peaks of the mountains.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked – both human and otherwise – along his arduous journey.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  Warp drives hummed, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Though safer than Gareth's perilous path, the journey held its own peril – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, and the chilling possibility of encountering unknown, hostile intelligences amongst the stars.
