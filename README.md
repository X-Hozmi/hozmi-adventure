His journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred him onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory in his arduous quest.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and meticulously calculating hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness than the empty plains of medieval Europe; the thrill of discovery, though, burned just as brightly in her heart, a testament to the enduring human spirit's yearning for the unknown.
