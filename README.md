
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant mirage in the shimmering heat.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a king's desperate plea—a scroll detailing a lost relic said to hold the power to heal a plague-ridden kingdom.  Ahead lies a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes, each step a gamble against starvation, violence, and the ever-present shadow of disease. The whispered rumors of mythical creatures and forgotten magic only amplify the adventure's daunting allure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Kerrigan pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component for the galactic peace-keeping force from a remote mining colony on the ice planet of Nird.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirates that plague the outer rim is a daily challenge, but the lure of untold riches and the knowledge that his success could determine the fate of billions fuels his unwavering determination. The cosmos is a vast, unforgiving expanse, but to Rexx, it is home.
