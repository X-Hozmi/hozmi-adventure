
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his squire's complaints ringing in his ears, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-infested Black Forest was far from the glorious crusade he'd envisioned.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised danger –  a sudden ambush, a treacherous bog, or the chilling whisper of the forest itself.  The promise of riches and glory in the far-off Holy Land felt a million leagues away, eclipsed by the immediate struggle for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a jewel glittering impossibly far from the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way.  The journey, fraught with cosmic radiation and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, tested her courage and skill at every turn.  But the vast, uncharted expanse of space, teeming with wonders both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of thrill than any medieval forest could ever offer.
