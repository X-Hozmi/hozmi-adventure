
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree had summoned him to the far reaches of the kingdom, a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers:  wild beasts lurking in the shadows, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the ever-shifting allegiances of the scattered villages he passed.  His reward, should he survive, was a chance at fortune and perhaps, even glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy. The ship's AI, a dryly sarcastic entity named HALIX, hummed with the calculations needed to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents.  Elara, however, was less concerned with astrophysics and more concerned with the growing tremor in the ship's hull. A pirate fleet, the notorious 'Void Serpents', were rumored to prowl this sector – a deadly threat even to a ship as powerful as hers.
