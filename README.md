
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s weary band crested the hill, their battered armor reflecting the setting sun.  Weeks of relentless travel across the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire had tested their mettle and their supplies.  Whispers of a lost city, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic, spurred them onward, defying the dangers of bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the grim reminder of their perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Warp drives hummed, defying the immense distances between star systems, and the vast emptiness of space held a thrill as terrifying as it was exhilarating.  The unknown dangers of alien lifeforms, hostile space pirates, and the unpredictable whims of interstellar travel constantly loomed, but the promise of discovery fueled her unwavering resolve.
