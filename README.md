
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead, the vast, untamed wilderness of the Black Forest stretches before her, a tapestry of shadowed peaks and whispering trees.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled deep within, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hints at the dangers lurking – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown.  This journey, fraught with peril, is her only hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport paint a breathtaking, yet terrifying, canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Arm of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and facing the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena, Ryla's crew pushes the boundaries of human exploration. The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, offers both wonder and death in equal measure.
