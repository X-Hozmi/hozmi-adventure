
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary horse onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a testament to their arduous journey across the unforgiving plains of France.  Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath of his mount, marked their progress towards the mythical city of Ys, a pilgrimage fuelled by whispers of unimaginable riches and ancient magic. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, testing their resolve and forging a bond of brotherhood stronger than any castle wall.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the deck as they leaped across galaxies, their destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony.  The vastness of space, a humbling expanse of cosmic dust and swirling energy, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and maintaining the ship's delicate life support systems were challenges as formidable as any medieval knight faced, but the promise of a new world, a new beginning, fueled their intrepid mission.
