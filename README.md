
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara's small band of travelers pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust devils against the setting sun. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, had already claimed a toll – supplies dwindling, tempers frayed, and the constant threat of bandits a chilling reality. Yet, the lure of the lost city, whispered of in hushed tones across taverns, fueled their weary steps, promising untold riches and perhaps even immortality. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Ava Sharma piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the bridge. Their mission: to chart a course through unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for human colonization.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling lights of distant suns and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The risks were immeasurable – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the potential for encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  But for Ava and her crew, the thrill of discovery far outweighed the dangers, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
