
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered rumors, guided her towards the legendary lost city of Ys.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the allure of the unknown propelled her onward, fuelled by whispered tales of untold riches and forgotten magic.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda Galaxy from our own.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby as she navigated through asteroid fields and nebulas of breathtaking beauty, her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of space – rogue black holes, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the potential rewards, the unlocking of interstellar exploration for humankind, made it a risk worth taking.
