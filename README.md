
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she urges her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Ahead lies the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be teeming with bandits and mythical beasts.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sends a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in this untamed land.  She carries with her not only supplies, but also the hope of a desperate family.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of the cosmos, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes make her journey a perilous adventure, but the potential rewards – a new beginning for humanity – fuel her unwavering determination.
