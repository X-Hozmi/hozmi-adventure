
The year is 1347.  Dust coats my worn leather jerkin as I lead my small band across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the promise of peril – bandits, starvation, or the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered about in smoky taverns, fuels our weary steps. We navigate by the stars, relying on ancient maps and the sagacious guidance of our grizzled leader, a man whose eyes hold the weight of a thousand journeys.  The unknown stretches ahead, a tapestry woven with both fear and exhilarating hope.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive is a constant companion.  I stare out at the swirling nebula, a cosmic canvas painted with colors unseen on Earth, as we jump between galaxies. Our mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets. Each warp jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of space.  The dangers are not bandits or disease, but rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile civilizations. Yet, the boundless expanse of space, teeming with uncharted wonders, beckons us forward, driven by the human spirit's insatiable thirst for discovery.
