
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred plains of Anatolia as Sir Kaelan adjusted his worn surcoat.  His journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was far from over; weeks of relentless sun and treacherous mountain passes lay ahead, each dawn bringing the threat of bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the whispers of untold riches and ancient knowledge spurred him on, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape. The clink of his spurs against the rocky trail was the only sound for miles, save the occasional cry of a hawk circling high above.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast distances between star systems were a constant challenge, punctuated by the occasional asteroid field or rogue gravitational pull.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the possibility of encountering new civilizations, and the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest mysteries fueled her and her crew, making the risks of interstellar travel worthwhile.
