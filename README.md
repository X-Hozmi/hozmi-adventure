The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the rugged landscape, the scent of pine and damp earth filling his lungs.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of St.  Alban – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across sprawling forests teeming with bandits, and into the heart of unforgiving wilderness. Each sunrise brought new dangers, from raging rivers to hostile lords, yet the unwavering glint of the holy symbol in his mind spurred him forward.

Alien encounters, treacherous gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of system failures were just some of the challenges she and her crew faced in their daring exploration of the uncharted cosmos.
