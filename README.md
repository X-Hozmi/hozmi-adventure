
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the dangers of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a fleeting moment of rest before the next leg of their perilous pilgrimage.  The allure of Jerusalem, however, fueled his determination, a beacon burning brightly against the bleak landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Unlike the medieval knights before her, her journey wasn't measured in leagues but in light-years, her enemies not bandits but cosmic anomalies and rival corporations.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets and galaxies, transforming the vast expanse of space into a navigable ocean. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, echoed across the ages, uniting Sir Reginald and Captain Rostova in a shared spirit of adventurous exploration.
