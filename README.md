Each step forward is a gamble, each encounter a test of courage and wit.

A lone starship captain, haunted by the loss of her crew, sets course for the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking a legendary artifact that promises immortality.

But she presses on, fueled by a desperate hope and a burning desire to find answers to the universe's greatest mysteries. The stars are her guide, the vast expanse of space her playground, and the secrets of the cosmos her ultimate prize.
