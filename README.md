
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of Francia, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards of his homeland.  His quest, to recover the stolen relic of Saint Michael, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of barbarian forests.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the hope of success fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, the ship a fragile speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The unknown beckoned, a siren song of discovery echoing across the silent gulf between worlds.
