
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem felt endless, a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of untamed forests, the chilling grandeur of mountain passes, and the vibrant chaos of bustling medieval towns.  Each day brought the risk of bandits, disease, or the unpredictable fury of nature, but the promise of the Holy Land, of adventure and perhaps redemption, spurred him on.  The clatter of his horse's hooves on cobblestone was a constant rhythm against the backdrop of whispered prayers and the distant calls of hawks.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with the peril of unmapped asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.   The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held a different kind of beauty than Sir Reginald's earthy journey, but the thrill of discovery, the push against the unknown, remained the same, a powerful current driving her forward across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
