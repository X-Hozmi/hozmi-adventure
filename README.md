
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of worn leather and dusty canvas, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  The air shimmers with heat, and the scent of parched earth mingles with the tang of woodsmoke from our meager fires.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger, but the allure of the fabled Silk Road, promising untold riches and exotic spices, pushes us onward.  The whispered tales of lost cities and ancient magic fuel our weary steps, a potent elixir against the harsh realities of the journey.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the hyperdrive fills the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter* as we pierce the veil of hyperspace, leaving behind the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The risks are immense – unpredictable nebulae, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space. But the promise of galactic exploration, of discovering new worlds and civilizations, ignites a fire in our hearts that burns brighter than any sun.
