
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the only sound louder than the rhythmic beat of their weary horses' hooves.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought the daunting prospect of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the hope of Eldoria spurred them on, a shimmering beacon in the bleak landscape of their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant reminder of the vast distances they traversed.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, showing the treacherous asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies they had to overcome.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, but Eva, fueled by the pioneering spirit of humanity, pressed forward, carrying the hopes of a new colony on her shoulders.
