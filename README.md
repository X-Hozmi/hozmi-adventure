
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague.  Days bled into weeks, their journey punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueling their weary bodies and hardening their resolve against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the occasional rogue asteroid, presented a different kind of challenge – one of technological reliance, cosmic hazards, and the constant pressure of isolation amidst the infinite expanse.
