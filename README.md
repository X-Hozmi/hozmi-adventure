
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, led his small band across the windswept moors.  Their destination: the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in Eldoria, whispered on the wind, spurred them onward, a beacon against the encroaching darkness.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space kraken known as the Gloomfang, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the possibility of finding survivors fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
