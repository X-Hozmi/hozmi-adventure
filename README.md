
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the spreading plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and possibility, a constant reminder of the adventure – and the risk – that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, a stark contrast to the humming machinery within.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space held the same allure and danger as the medieval wilderness, but the stakes were far greater, the scale of exploration unimaginable to those who journeyed only on Earth.
