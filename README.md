
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves, each shadow amongst the ancient oaks, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the wild beasts that roamed these lands.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Montsegur, felt less a noble mission and more a desperate gamble against the encroaching darkness and the endless miles stretching before him.  His only companions were his sword, his faith, and the gnawing hunger in his belly.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, had been rough, the warp drive straining under the gravitational pull.  Ahead lay the challenge of navigating the planet's treacherous atmosphere and establishing a foothold on a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  But the vast, star-dusted canvas outside her viewport held a different kind of darkness, the endless expanse of space promising both incredible discovery and the very real threat of cosmic anomalies and uncharted dangers.  The fate of humanity's expansion rested on her shoulders, a weight as heavy as any medieval knight's burden.
