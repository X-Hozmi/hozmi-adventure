
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact.  Days blurred into weeks, filled with skirmishes against bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, spurred on by whispers of ancient magic and the promise of untold riches – or perhaps, just survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: a vital trade run between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a journey spanning light years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate fleets, and battling cosmic storms were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like Eva.  But the lure of exotic alien worlds and the promise of unimaginable profit – alongside the ever-present risk of encountering unknown and hostile lifeforms – made the dangers seem a small price to pay.
