
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary horse onward. The dust of the King's Road choked him, but the thrill of his quest – to retrieve the stolen relic from the treacherous Black Mire – spurred him on.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown hedgerows, hinted at danger. Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the sprawling landscape of Albion.  He pressed on, his heart a drum against his ribs, towards the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. The vibrant colours painted across the viewport were a breathtaking distraction from the perilous jump to the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and retrieve vital data. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering uncharted alien lifeforms were mere inconveniences compared to the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the endless possibilities of the cosmos fueled her daring expedition, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of discovery.
