
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind the caravan as it snaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, gripped the reins of his destrier, his gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering heat haze.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of the fabled City of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, propelled him onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  This journey, fraught with peril, promised untold riches and glory, or a nameless grave beneath the unforgiving sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's technological prowess.  Yet, the vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, friendly or otherwise.  The journey was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of a new home, a new beginning, spurred her on through the inky blackness.
