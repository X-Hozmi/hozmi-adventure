
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless rhythm of horse hooves and the ever-present threat of bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable moods of nature.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to fording icy rivers, their quest fueled by faith and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing vital systems amidst the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, Eva and her crew faced cosmic storms and the silent loneliness of interstellar travel, their determination fueled by hope and the enduring human spirit.
