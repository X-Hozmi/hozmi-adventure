
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, guided his weary horse across the windswept plains.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of an empty belly, and the ever-present uncertainty of the trail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  He clutched a tattered map, its edges frayed from countless nights spent huddled around flickering campfires, its promises as alluring and as perilous as the journey itself.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, tested his courage and his resolve with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space held its own unique terrors: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to locate a rare mineral on the planet Kepler-186f, crucial for powering the Galactic Federation’s newly developed warp drive.  The shimmering constellations outside her viewport offered a breathtaking view, but the cold, unyielding void underscored the immense distances and potential dangers inherent in intergalactic travel.
