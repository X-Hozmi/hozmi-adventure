
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Her quest, to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, led her through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of mythical beasts haunted the twilight.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the lure of the lost city, and the whispers of its untold riches, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, famine, and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a relic said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate incursions from the Kryll Hegemony, and deciphering ancient star charts were all in a day's work for Eva.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with swirling nebulas and distant suns, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers, but the promise of discovery fuelled her relentless journey.
