
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a raven's wing.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her from the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her quest to find a cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the hope of reaching her destination, a beacon of life in a vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the crimson nebula, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Facing unimaginable distances, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted void, Ryla pushed the boundaries of human exploration, driven by a desperate hope to reunite with her people and discover the secrets of their lost heritage amidst a breathtaking, and terrifying, cosmic tapestry.
