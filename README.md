
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the unknown – rumored lands of silks and spices, but also whispered tales of brigands and monstrous beasts.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, transforming the journey from a simple trade route into a constant, thrilling test of courage and resilience.  The map, stained and tattered, offered little comfort, its promise of riches overshadowed by the perilous reality of the journey itself.


Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The jump would be risky, a gamble against the unforgiving void, but the potential rewards – interstellar exploration, untold riches – were too tempting to resist. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant reminder of the immense power, and the terrifying fragility, of their vessel as they plunged into the unknown, trusting their calculations and their ship's integrity against the awesome power of space.
