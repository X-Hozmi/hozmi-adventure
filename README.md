
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, mirroring the turmoil in his own heart.  His quest: to find the lost monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a relic capable of ending the Black Death’s relentless grip.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that tested the limits of both man and beast.  But the whispers of the monastery, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the existential dread of the unknown.  The vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant, alien landscapes she glimpsed on distant moons.  The fate of hundreds hung in the balance, a weight far heavier than any physical burden, as she steered her vessel deeper into the inky blackness.
