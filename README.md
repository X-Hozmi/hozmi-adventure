
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onwards, the muddy track barely discernible beneath the relentless autumn rain.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliff edges, and the constant gnawing hunger that tested even the strongest wills.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred us onward, a beacon in the deepening twilight of our perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Millennia later, the stars themselves were our highways.  Our sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of swirling nebulae and distant galaxies.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the possibility of encountering uncharted systems teeming with alien life – both benevolent and hostile.  Our mission, to retrieve a vital artifact from the Xylos system, was fraught with peril, but the thrill of exploration, of charting the unmapped reaches of the cosmos, fueled our courage.
