
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred by whispers of a mythical city of gold hidden amidst the treacherous peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, trudged onward.  Each step was a battle against the elements – biting winds, treacherous ravines, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  Our meager supplies dwindled, our horses grew gaunt, but the lure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown kept our spirits, however flickering, alight. The journey itself, fraught with peril and hardship, was as rewarding as any treasure we might find.


Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cut a silent path through the Andromeda galaxy. Captain Eva Rostova, her face etched with the weariness of countless jumps across light-years, guided her crew towards the Xylos system.  The mission: to secure a vital resource, the Xylos crystal, essential for sustaining life on a dying Earth.  The dangers were less tangible than bandits and blizzards – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – but the stakes were infinitely higher.  The vastness of space, a canvas of glittering nebulae and silent planets, held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns.
