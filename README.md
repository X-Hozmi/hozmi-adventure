
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unforgiving desert stretched before him like a sea of sand.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – starvation, dehydration, or perhaps worse – encounters with tribes who saw outsiders as little more than walking provisions.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, a whisper of possibility in a harsh world, propelled him forward.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet clinging to life on the edge of known space.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, unpredictable wormholes capable of spitting them out light years from their intended destination.  Pirate raiders, lurking in the dark sectors between stars, presented a constant threat.  But the weight of responsibility, the hope of saving lives on a distant world, fueled her courage and guided her ship through the black void, a tiny vessel against the unimaginable vastness of the cosmos.
