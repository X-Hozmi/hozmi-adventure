
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, pressed onward through the mud-caked tracks of the French countryside.  Each creak of our wagon wheels was a testament to the miles already conquered, each rise of the sun a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The promise of the legendary City of Ys, a jewel rumored to lie hidden beyond the haunted mountains, fueled our relentless march, a shimmering beacon in the grim reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, cut through the inky black, leaving a shimmering trail in its wake.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, a colossal undertaking requiring months spent traversing the void between star systems, each jump a leap of faith across light years. The breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the terrifying majesty of black holes were constant companions on our voyage, a testament to the awe-inspiring and perilous nature of interstellar exploration.
