
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, guided his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of untold riches and ancient wisdom, spurred him onward, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unimaginable distances.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms were commonplace hazards.  But the promise of discovering new civilizations, of charting unmapped territories in the cosmos, fueled her determination, making her a pioneer in the relentless exploration of the infinite universe.
