Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and terrifying dangers.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on this arduous journey across the breadth of the kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.

The vastness of space held its own brand of danger, from rogue space pirates to unforeseen cosmic phenomena. Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, spurred her onward, a testament to human ambition reaching beyond the confines of a single world.
