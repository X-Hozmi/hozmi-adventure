
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Their journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous after the spring rains, and the whispers of a monstrous beast haunting the Whispering Mountains chilled her to the bone. Yet, the promise of the fabled Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins beyond the mountains, fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their hyperdrive sputtered, threatening to strand them halfway between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Cygnus X-1 system. Pirates, not bandits, were their greatest threat, ruthless scavengers preying on slower vessels. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the unpredictable nature of intergalactic travel – a constant gamble between daring exploration and utter annihilation.  The quest for the legendary Xylos crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, made the risk worthwhile.
