
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains.  Her quest, to reach the mythical city of Zerzura rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the canyons, starvation gnawed at her belly, and the endless expanse tested her resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new obstacle to overcome – a raging river, a treacherous mountain pass, the chilling whispers of the desert wind.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the whisper of untold knowledge, spurred her relentlessly onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, orbiting a red dwarf star.  The journey was a symphony of shimmering starlight and the hum of the hyperdrive, punctuated by the occasional asteroid shower or gravitational anomaly.  While the physical dangers were different – radiation storms, rogue space debris – the thrill of exploration, the unwavering determination to overcome the vastness of space, mirrored the spirit of medieval adventurers charting unknown lands. The unknown always beckoned.
