
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in silks and spices, a perilous cargo bought with a promise of knighthood.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the nearby forest, sent a shiver down his spine; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked at every turn.  His journey to the distant port of Marseilles was a constant battle against the elements and the shadowy figures that stalked the edges of civilization.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's mastery of interstellar travel, but the vastness of space held its own terrors.  Uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of rogue AI presented challenges far beyond any medieval knight could have imagined.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds, fueled her relentless journey.
