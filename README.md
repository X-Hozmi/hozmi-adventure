
Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track wound through a forest primeval, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's ailing son – was a perilous one.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts made each league a victory hard-won.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield, but also the weight of hope, his determination a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the rumored sentient crystalline lifeforms inhabiting the planet Kepler-186f, light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, far removed from the simpler dangers of medieval travel. Yet the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same – a driving force that pushed the boundaries of human exploration across the vast, uncharted expanse of space.
