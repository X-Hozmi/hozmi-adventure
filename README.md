
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of weathered canvas and groaning ox carts, creaks its way across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we skirt bandit-infested forests and ford treacherous rivers, the ever-present threat of raiders a constant companion.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge: negotiating with suspicious villagers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, or simply finding enough water to sustain our dwindling supplies.  The whispered legends of lost cities and mythical creatures fuel our weary steps, a potent mixture of fear and exhilarating hope.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts is routine now, but the sheer scale of the cosmos still inspires awe.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from countless worlds, share a common hunger for discovery – for charting unmapped nebulae and encountering alien civilizations, some friendly, some less so. The journey itself, fraught with technological challenges and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown dangers, is as rewarding as the destination.
