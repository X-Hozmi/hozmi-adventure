
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Each creak of my saddle warned of another day's journey across the unforgiving landscape.  We rode, a small band of mercenaries, towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in taverns and sung of in ballads, said to hold unimaginable riches and even more dangerous secrets. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were our constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown propelled us onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became my highway.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting constant as we jumped between galaxies, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  Our mission: to chart the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperately overpopulated Earth.  The breathtaking nebulae and strange, alien worlds we encountered were wondrous beyond comprehension, yet the loneliness of deep space and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile lifeforms kept us vigilant, our journey a thrilling dance between awe and survival.
