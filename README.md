Her journey to the rumored lost city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling to their deaths, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation was a companion more faithful than any man.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, yet the lure of the unknown, the whisper of forgotten magic, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson and gold gas a stark contrast to the cold, hard steel of her ship. Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the uncharted planet of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the daily grind.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of undiscovered worlds, and the promise of scientific breakthroughs fueled her insatiable thirst for adventure.
