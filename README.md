
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The wind whipped across the vast, undulating plains of France, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant rain.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a chance encounter with a wandering hermit, or perhaps even the discovery of a forgotten, ancient ruin. The road was long and dangerous, but the promise of Eldoria fueled his weary bones.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond the known galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva’s journey demanded courage and precision. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the allure of a universe brimming with untold wonders – and untold dangers – was an irresistible siren call.
