
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless; days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing another stretch of rutted road, punctuated by the occasional ramshackle village or menacing forest.  He’d traded the familiar comfort of his blacksmith’s forge for the uncertain promise of crusade, driven by faith, fear, and a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than any hearth fire. The whispers of Saracen swords and the exotic spices promised in far-off lands fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae, swirling colours unseen on any terrestrial world, painted a breathtaking backdrop to her perilous mission.  Unlike Thomas’s journey across a single, familiar planet, Elara traversed the uncharted expanse of the cosmos, charting new systems and facing down cosmic pirates and unpredictable wormholes. The adventure wasn't just about the destination – a mythical lost colony on the edge of known space – but the endless wonders and terrifying unknowns encountered along the way.
