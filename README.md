
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his armor heavy with the dust of a thousand miles, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the Sultanate of Rum, a journey fraught with peril – bandit lords, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating dense forests, bartering with suspicious villagers, and facing down the occasional disgruntled knight.  His quest, to retrieve a stolen relic, fueled his determination, pushing him ever closer to his uncertain destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey across vast interstellar distances. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was routine; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the unknown entities lurking in the unexplored sectors of the galaxy.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers, relied on their advanced technology and unwavering courage as they pressed on, their hope a beacon against the chilling emptiness of space.
