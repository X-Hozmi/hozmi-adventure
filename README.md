Her leather jerkin, patched and worn, offered little protection against the biting wind.  This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and disease stalked the crowded roads.  But the whispered tales of miracles, the hope of redemption, fueled her weary legs and spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and breathtaking vistas.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was treacherous; charting a course through unmapped star systems demanded precision and unwavering courage.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos unfolding before her.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable power, but the dangers were not limited to cosmic radiation and rogue asteroids – rival corporations and alien pirates were just as deadly threats to her success.
