
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse. Yet, the whispered tales of the fabled City of Ys, hidden beyond the treacherous Black Mountains, spurred her onward.  The journey was fraught with peril –  a desperate flight from a burning village, a harrowing river crossing, the chilling stare of a wolf pack – but the promise of discovery fueled her tireless spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station orbiting Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional rogue pirate vessel was all in a day’s work. The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and distant suns, held a different kind of peril; the silent threat of equipment failure, the crushing weight of loneliness in the black void between worlds, and the ever-present danger of encountering the unknown within the unexplored corners of the galaxy.
