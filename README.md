
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister – had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and into dark forests where the whispers of unseen things chilled him to the bone. Each sunrise brought the promise of new peril, each sunset the weary ache of miles traversed, but the hope of Zerzura spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, 'Stardust Wanderer', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but Elara's seasoned crew and her advanced technology offered a chance to overcome the seemingly insurmountable distances, each jump across the void a leap into the unknown, each new system a breathtaking marvel of cosmic wonder.
