
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their meager supplies dwindling with each passing day.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had tested their resolve beyond measure.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had become their constant companions.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's unimaginable riches and potent magic fueled their weary steps, promising a reward that outweighed any hardship. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, a chance to conquer another league of the unforgiving terrain.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the hyperdrive a familiar lullaby.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Eva, seasoned by countless voyages, felt the thrill of discovery coursing through her veins, a familiar addiction that superseded any fear. The cosmos was her canvas, and every jump to warp speed a brushstroke painting the future of humankind.
