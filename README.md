
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map – her only companions on this perilous journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed glen, the weather shifted from scorching sun to freezing rain without warning, and the sheer scale of the mountains threatened to swallow her whole. Yet, the whispered tales of Zaragoza's hidden riches and ancient secrets fueled her onward, a relentless fire in her belly despite the constant gnawing fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of star jumps and navigational calculations, a constant battle against asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of warp storms. The thrill of exploration, the siren call of the unknown, outweighed the risks.  He and his crew were pioneers, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, each successful jump a testament to their courage and skill in this unforgiving, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
