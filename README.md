
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had become a perilous adventure.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked them like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: fording swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers in isolated villages. Their survival depended on their courage, their wits, and the strength of their mounts.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova, at the helm of the starship *Odyssey*, charted a course across the Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced dangers far beyond anything a medieval knight could imagine: black holes, nebulae of unpredictable energies, and alien civilizations with intentions unknown.  Faster-than-light travel brought the cosmos within reach, but the vastness of space and its inherent risks made every jump into hyperspace a gamble, a breathtaking plunge into the unknown.
