
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the city, and the hope it offered, spurred them on, a beacon in the grim landscape of a dying world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology capable of interstellar communication.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate vessels was a daily grind, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of uncharted star systems.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, a seasoned explorer, pressed on, driven by the hope of reconnecting humanity with its lost kin across the galactic void.
