
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Eastern Europe, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and sun-drenched vineyards I'd left behind in the south.  My quest, a perilous journey to find the legendary lost city of Zerzura, had already claimed several companions and countless supplies.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fuelled my relentless pursuit.


Centuries later, in the 27th century, my starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a swathe through the nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted fantastical patterns across my viewport as I navigated treacherous asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris and the occasional pirate vessel. My mission – to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy – was a far cry from the medieval treks of my ancestors.  While the dangers were different -  warp core meltdowns and hostile alien encounters instead of bandits and starvation – the same thrill of discovery, the same intoxicating sense of pushing the boundaries of the known, pulsed through my veins.
