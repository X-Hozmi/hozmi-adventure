
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary horse as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to seek absolution for a past transgression, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in impoverished villages.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the enduring human spirit's capacity for perseverance.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril—the unknown.  Uncharted systems harbored strange, unpredictable phenomena, and the constant hum of the ship's engines was a constant reminder of the fragility of life light years from home. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
