
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps,  our caravan a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travellers. Whispers of bandits and treacherous passes haunted our nights, punctuated only by the crackling of the campfire and the distant howl of wolves. We sought the fabled Silk Road, a path paved with both riches and ruin, hoping to reach the exotic lands of the East, trading tales and goods along the way.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to our resilience.


Centuries later, in the year 2742,  the stars themselves were our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, hummed beneath me as we pierced the veil of a nebula, the vibrant colours a breathtaking spectacle. Our destination: Xylos, a planet light-years away, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms were mere inconveniences in our pursuit of knowledge. The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, was a stark contrast to the medieval journeys of our ancestors, yet the thirst for discovery, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same.
