
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of Eldoria's healing balm fueled their weary steps, transforming the brutal journey into a desperate, exhilarating chase against both time and fate.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth and teeming with unknown dangers.  The ship's hyperdrive hummed, a constant reminder of the vast distances separating her from home.  Asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of system failure made each jump to hyperspace a gamble. But the potential rewards, a lifeline for a dying Earth, spurred her onwards through the inky black of space.
