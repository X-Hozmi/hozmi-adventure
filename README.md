
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, spurred his destrier onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of crowded taverns and the fearsome whispers of bandits that had dogged his journey across the rugged highlands.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vast, inky canvas of space stretched before her, jeweled with distant galaxies and the faint, ethereal glow of uncharted planets.  Her mission: to locate a new source of Xylium, a vital element dwindling on Earth.  Navigation charts were unreliable in this sector, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, but the potential reward—a future for her people—outweighed the risks of cosmic radiation and unknown alien encounters.
