
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and sweating horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the parched grass, fuels the whispers of bandits, desert spirits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  We push onward, fueled by whispers of untold riches and the burning hope of reaching our destination, a journey as fraught with peril as it is with promise.


Centuries hence, the sleek starship *Starseeker* slices through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is a daily challenge.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space holds both wonder and dread, the silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the nervous chatter of the crew, each of them facing the unknown with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.
