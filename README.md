
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate gamble to reach the rumored gold mines in the far east.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or the harsh indifference of nature itself.  This journey, a tapestry woven with grit, fear, and unwavering determination, would define her life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unseen celestial bodies was commonplace for a seasoned explorer like her. But this mission was different; Kepler-186f held the key to humanity's survival, a chance to escape the dying embers of their home planet. The vast, star-dusted canvas of space, both beautiful and deadly, was her arena.
