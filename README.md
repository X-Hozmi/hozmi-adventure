
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Brigid.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to the unwavering human spirit seeking knowledge beyond the familiar.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising signs of sentient life.  Navigating asteroid fields and the treacherous gravitational pull of a dying star was child's play compared to the political machinations and corporate espionage that threatened her mission.  The vastness of space held wonders beyond imagination, but also dangers as infinite as the cosmos itself;  Eva's adventure was a battle against both the unknown and the all-too-human failings that shadowed even the furthest reaches of the galaxy.
