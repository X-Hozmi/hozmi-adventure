
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's writ, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged town far to the east.  Days blurred into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new tapestry of rolling hills, dark forests whispering with unseen creatures, and bustling market towns overflowing with the sights, sounds, and smells of a world both familiar and utterly foreign.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, storms threatened to swallow him whole, but the weight of his mission, and the hope it represented, pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Elara's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, unknowable emptiness.  Her mission was to chart unexplored nebulae, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown,  with the possibility of discovering breathtaking new worlds or facing the unimaginable horrors of space.  The loneliness was profound, yet the thrill of exploration, the sheer scale of the universe, fueled her journey onward.
