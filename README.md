
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to the Holy Land was a grueling tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, the sting of hunger, and the ever-present fear of disease.  Each creak of their battered wagons, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for peril. Yet, amidst the hardships, a fierce camaraderie bloomed, forged in shared hardship and the common goal of reaching Jerusalem.  The whispers of adventure, of the exotic and unknown, spurred them onward, despite the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced dangers far beyond the ken of medieval knights – rogue asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling silence of interstellar space. But the allure of discovery, the promise of finding new life and new civilizations, outweighed the risks.  The vast expanse of the cosmos was their canvas, and the *Stardust Wanderer*, their brush, painting a future yet unwritten.
