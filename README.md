
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rutted road a ribbon of mud snaking through the bleak autumn landscape.  Each creak of saddle leather, each whinny of our exhausted horses, punctuated the silence broken only by the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  Our destination, the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered of in hushed tones, beckoned us onward, promising riches and perhaps, salvation, from the encroaching shadow of the Black Death.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the lure of the unknown fueled our relentless progress.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our roads.  The Althea, a sleek starship capable of faster-than-light travel, cut a swathe through the inky blackness of deep space.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable worlds among a tapestry of nebulae and distant suns.  The risk was immense, the unknown vast, but the promise of discovering new life, new civilizations, and unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, spurred us on. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space itself, but the potential rewards far outweighed the dangers.
