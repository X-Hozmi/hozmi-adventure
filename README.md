
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a cryptic summons to a distant monastery rumored to hold a powerful relic, had thrust him into this perilous journey.  Each dawn brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  He traveled with only a battered sword, a few meager supplies, and the unwavering hope that his quest would bring him glory, or at least, survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars and the chilling silence of the void, held a different kind of peril.  Engine malfunctions, pirate attacks from rival corporations, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps threatened to end her voyage before she reached her destination.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, propelled her forward.
