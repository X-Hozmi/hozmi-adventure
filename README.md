
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking bridge, each shadowed forest path, held the promise of peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the hope of healing fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble – a rogue asteroid field could shatter her ship, and pirates lurked in the shadowed corners of the galaxy. Yet the needs of the colonists, the weight of responsibility, propelled her forward, across light-years and unimaginable distances, a lone beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
