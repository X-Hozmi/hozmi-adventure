
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and the map – a crude, almost illegible scrawl – guiding her to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both wonder and peril: bandits, starvation, or the very elements themselves threatened to end her quest before it reached its thrilling climax.  The journey was fraught with hardship, but the allure of the unknown, the whisper of ancient secrets, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the vast, silent expanse of space surrounding her ship.  While the dangers were different – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies – the thrill of exploration remained the same.  The uncharted territory, the possibility of discovering new life and worlds, fueled her relentless drive across the cosmic ocean.
