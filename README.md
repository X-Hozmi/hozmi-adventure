
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her and her equally weary mule.  Their journey across the fractured kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send them tumbling to their deaths, and the whispers of a mythical beast, a wyvern said to guard a lost city, chilled her to the bone. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, pushing her further into the unknown wilderness towards her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to the hum of their hyperdrive.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unpredictable expanse of the cosmos.  Alien landscapes, unknown sentient species, and the ever-present threat of pirates posed constant dangers, but the lure of Xylos, and the hope of finding surviving colonists, fueled their journey across the stars.
