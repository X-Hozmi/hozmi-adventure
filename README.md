
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a chipped map, its parchment brittle with age, promising riches and glory in the distant Sultanate.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the splintered kingdoms of Europe and the perilous steppes beyond. Every sunrise brought new dangers, but the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of exotic lands and untold wealth, kept him pushing ever eastward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable hazards of hyperspace travel.  The sleek, chrome hull of her vessel contrasted sharply with the ancient, hand-drawn map Thomas had carried, but the underlying thrill, the unyielding human spirit that yearned to explore the unknown, remained the same, a timeless echo across the vast gulf of time and space.
