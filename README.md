
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward.  Their journey across the blighted moors, toward the rumored lost city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Each creak of their worn saddles, each rustle in the overgrown fields, sent shivers down their spines.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in myth.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, with its promise of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries hence, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but their destination, the fabled Kepler-186f, remained a distant flicker of hope amidst the inky blackness.  Facing radiation storms, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships, Elara and her crew clung to their mission: to find a new home for humanity amongst the stars, a legacy far grander than any medieval quest.
