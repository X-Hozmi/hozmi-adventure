
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promised both peril and untold riches – whispered legends of a lost city nestled within their jagged peaks fueled his arduous journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the unpredictable dangers of the medieval world: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His quest was a gamble, but the potential rewards – glory, gold, and perhaps even a cure for his ailing sister – made it a risk worth taking.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space.  This journey wasn't about gold or glory; it was about survival – finding a new home for humanity.  The challenges were different, but the spirit of adventure remained the same: navigating the unknown, facing unimaginable odds, driven by a relentless hope for a brighter future.
