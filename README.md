
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from over, each winding path a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild animals.  The rumored lost city of Eldoria, with its promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, was a beacon guiding her through the unforgiving landscape, a beacon worth risking everything to reach.  The whispers of its magic spurred her onward, a counterpoint to the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was a risky one, pushing the limits of their hyperdrive, but the potential rewards – a newly discovered planet teeming with rare elements – were too tempting to ignore.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace, a thrilling dance between survival and discovery in a universe vast and full of unimaginable wonders. The thrill of interstellar travel, though vastly different, echoed the same adventurous spirit as Elara's medieval quest.
