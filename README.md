
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the rhythmic thud of hooves on hard earth, the creak of saddle leather, and the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements. Each sunrise brought a renewed test of their resilience, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the persistent allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by a centuries-old star map and her instincts.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, faced the perils of space – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates – with a mixture of bravery and gallows humor. Their quest: to find the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a gamble with potentially unimaginable rewards, or catastrophic failure.
