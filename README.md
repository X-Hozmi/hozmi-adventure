
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome was proving far more arduous than the tales of pilgrims had suggested.  Banditry was a constant threat, the nights were filled with chilling howls, and the sheer immensity of the unknown landscape pressed upon him, a constant reminder of his vulnerability. Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the Holy City, the whispered promises of salvation and redemption, spurred him further across the unforgiving terrain.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a perilous journey across light-years of unmapped space.  The potential rewards – new resources, habitable worlds – were immense, but so were the dangers: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life.  Eva gripped the controls, her heart pounding in rhythm with the ship's powerful thrusters, ready to face whatever the cosmos threw her way.
