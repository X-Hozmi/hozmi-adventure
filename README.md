
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent winding through the sun-baked Provençal countryside, creaked onward.  Each day brought its own peril: bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient aqueducts, treacherous mountain passes where a single misstep meant a fatal plunge, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of distant spices and silks in Constantinople, fueled our weary steps. The journey was arduous, but the shared hardship forged bonds stronger than any castle wall.

Centuries later, the sleek starship *Starseeker* sliced through the inky blackness, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and traversing wormholes were child's play compared to the political maneuvering and bureaucratic hurdles back on Earth. But the breathtaking views of nebulae and the sheer scale of the cosmos were a reward in themselves.  The challenge was not just survival, but the discovery of something profoundly new, the expansion of humanity beyond its cradle, a legacy far grander than any medieval kingdom.
