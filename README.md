
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under a bruised sky, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  The rough-hewn map, stained with sweat and grime, was his only guide through a landscape fraught with peril and uncertainty, the promise of salvation a distant, shimmering mirage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigation was a delicate dance with gravity wells and unpredictable solar flares, every jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving void.  But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her relentless pursuit, a far cry from the medieval knight's desperate search, yet mirroring the same spirit of brave exploration.
