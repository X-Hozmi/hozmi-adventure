
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crests the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of a rival Baron, a journey fraught with treacherous mountain passes, murky forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each day brings new challenges – a ford swollen by unexpected rains, a confrontation with suspicious villagers, the chilling whisper of rumors about the Baron's unnatural allies.  Yet, the lure of glory and the weight of his oath spur him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across uncharted star systems and through asteroid fields that threaten to pulverize her vessel.  The vastness of space, the silent hum of the hyperdrive, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids make each jump a gamble with fate.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the hope of reuniting with lost kin, and the thrill of exploring the unknown are a stronger pull than any danger.
