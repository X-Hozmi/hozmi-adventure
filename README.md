
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village, a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her controls. Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.   Hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks were all part of a routine that, despite its technological marvels, held the same heart-pounding danger as Elara's medieval quest. The vastness of space, while beautiful, held its own unforgiving realities.
