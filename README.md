
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under the grey sky, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over sun-baked deserts.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges –  negotiating with wary villagers, navigating by the stars, and always, the ever-present threat of hunger and disease.  Their quest was not for gold or glory, but for faith, a journey as perilous and demanding as any knight could face.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each leg of her interstellar voyage a gamble.  Unlike the knights of old, her battles were fought not with swords but with lasers, her survival dependent not on horses and luck, but on cutting-edge technology and a quick trigger finger.  The vastness of space presented challenges as formidable as any medieval landscape.
