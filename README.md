
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The whispered tales of mythical beasts and forgotten cities fuel our weary steps, promising riches or ruin, depending on our luck and courage.  The shimmering heat haze dances on the horizon, obscuring the path ahead, but the lure of adventure, however perilous, drives us onward.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaps across interstellar distances, its hyperdrive a hum against the silent majesty of space.  Each jump is a gamble, a blind faith in the calculations of my aging navigation system.  The destinations are as varied as the cosmos itself:  a gas giant with floating cities, a dying sun nurturing alien ecosystems, and perhaps, a glimpse of the legendary Xylos system, home to a civilisation far older than humanity.  The vastness of space is a lonely mistress, but the promise of discovery is a potent siren song, pulling me ever further into the unknown.
