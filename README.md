
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a worn map, and the hope of reaching her estranged brother in Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both beauty and peril – bandit attacks, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey.  The thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a stark contrast to the stifling constraints of her village life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, held a different kind of danger - rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to chart new worlds and expand humanity’s reach, fueled his relentless drive across the cosmic ocean.  The adventure was different, but the human spirit's thirst for exploration remained unchanged.
