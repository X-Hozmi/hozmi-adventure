
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried bread and a chipped map, a testament to the perilous journey ahead.  She sought the lost monastery of St. Seraphina, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic, a journey fraught with brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled both her fear and her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a dance with gravity wells and unpredictable solar flares, the ship's AI a constant companion battling cosmic radiation and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  This wasn't a quest for lost magic, but for a new beginning, a chance to establish humanity's first off-world colony – a journey as fraught with peril as any medieval pilgrimage, but under a sky ablaze with a million unfamiliar suns.
