
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather – a guide to the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the treacherous marshes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of adventure, or peril; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching night were constant companions on her arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy, the crimson glow of his starship slicing through the cosmic dust. His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of warp engines, the crackle of subspace comms, and the ever-present risk of pirate attacks and rogue gravitational fields.  Unlike Elara's journey, Jaxx's was technologically advanced, but the thrill of the unknown, the gamble against insurmountable odds, remained the same timeless human impulse driving both adventurers across the vastness of their respective eras.
