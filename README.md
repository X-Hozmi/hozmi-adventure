
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Sir Reginald's destrier as he crested the hill, the vast, untamed expanse of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, said to lie hidden somewhere beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Ys, fueled his determination to press onward, a lone knight against the formidable backdrop of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours painting the viewport. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet within the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey light-years from the familiar comforts of Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and facing the existential dread of deep space travel, Elara led her crew towards a future potentially brimming with life or devoid of hope. The vast unknown stretched before them, a challenge both terrifying and exhilarating.
