
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, fueled their weary bodies and spurred them towards the unknown.  The journey tested their courage, their resilience, and the bonds of their friendship, forging an adventure that would etch itself onto their souls forever.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the encroaching darkness of a dying star.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate raids were commonplace hazards.  The vast distances between star systems were measured not in miles, but in lightyears, and each jump through hyperspace felt like a gamble against the unforgiving cosmos. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life and untold riches, and the responsibility of finding the lost colonists, drove Eva and her crew deeper into the uncharted territories of the galaxy, facing existential threats at every turn.
