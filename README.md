
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Yet, the glint of the distant mountains, the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, the vast, star-dusted expanse a breathtaking but perilous frontier.  While the dangers were different—cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life—the thrill of exploration, the allure of discovery, burned as brightly in Eva's heart as it had in Elara's.
