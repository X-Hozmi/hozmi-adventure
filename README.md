
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Reginald, his armor clanking, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was proving far more arduous than anticipated.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested his resolve at every turn. Yet, the promise of untold riches and the glory awaiting him spurred him onward, each sunrise painting a new canvas of challenges and breathtaking landscapes across the vast, unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'The Wanderer.'  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a calculated risk, a decades-long odyssey fuelled by the hope of discovering a habitable planet for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vastness of space, peppered with celestial wonders and unpredictable gravitational anomalies, presented a constant, exhilarating danger.  But with each jump through hyperspace, Eva felt the thrilling weight of responsibility and the exhilarating possibility of securing a future beyond Earth's fading horizons.
