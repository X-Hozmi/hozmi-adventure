
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her skin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother. The journey is fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, swirling sandstorms, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the hope of healing fuels her onward, a flickering candle in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, but the jump through hyperspace is a gamble.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make every interstellar voyage a roll of the dice.  Yet, the promise of new life, new resources, and the uncharted wonders of a previously unexplored planet outweigh the risks.  The galaxy is vast and dangerous, but for intrepid explorers like Ryla, the stars beckon.
