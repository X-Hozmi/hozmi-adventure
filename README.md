
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the surrounding forest, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harshness of the unforgiving landscape itself.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, his resolve fueled by a desperate hope for a better life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a beacon of hope for humanity's expanding reach.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable energy storms of interstellar travel was a daily risk, but the promise of discovery, the chance to chart unmapped galaxies, kept her and her crew pushing forward, their courage a testament to humanity's enduring spirit of exploration.
