
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains crimson.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, was her only guide to the mythical city of Eldoria, a place said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the hope of salvation spurred her onward, pushing her through exhaustion and despair.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by sentient crystalline lifeforms.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of distant suns was a daily routine, the vast, inky blackness of space both beautiful and terrifying.  The stakes were high, the journey fraught with peril, but Eva, fueled by a deep sense of duty and an insatiable thirst for exploration, pressed on, charting a course toward the unknown.
