
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I trudge across the desolate plains towards the rumored city of Eldoria.  My pack, heavy with meager supplies and a map older than myself, promises riches and glory – or a brutal, anonymous end swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brings the risk of bandit raids, starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, yet the lure of Eldoria, a city whispered to hold secrets lost to time, fuels my weary steps forward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive is a soothing counterpoint to the vast, star-dusted canvas outside my viewport. We're bound for Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey across the Andromeda galaxy is fraught with its own dangers: unpredictable nebulae, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  Yet, the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel and opening up countless new worlds – overshadows the risk, pushing us onward into the inky black.
