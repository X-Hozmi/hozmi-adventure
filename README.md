
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Her journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the sacred city, the whispers of miracles and the chance to escape a life of servitude, propelled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and unforeseen encounters.  The road was long and unforgiving, but the spirit of adventure burned bright in her heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, was measured in light-years, a lifetime compressed into months within the ship's accelerated time.  The challenges weren't bandits or disease, but rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  But Eva, hardened by years of exploration and fueled by humanity's thirst for new horizons, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the emerald jewel of a planet promising a future for her people among the stars.
