
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from over; whispers of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and untold riches, fueled her relentless pace.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the chance to forge her own legend, spurred her onward through winding passes and across unforgiving plains.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a testament to the indomitable human spirit seeking fortune and glory in a time of chivalry and peril.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the thrill of discovery never dulled.  Her mission: to chart unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable worlds for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the possibility of finding a new Eden, a new home, but also the potential for encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of a new era for humankind, a future woven from stardust and daring.
