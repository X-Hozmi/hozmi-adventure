
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of untold riches and exotic spices outweighs the perils. The whispered legends of Samarkand's markets, filled with silks finer than moonlight and jewels brighter than the desert stars, fuel our weary steps and bolster our courage against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of folding space, carries me across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess knowledge of a technology capable of rewriting the very fabric of reality.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a breathtaking leap of faith into the unknown.  The cosmos, both terrifying and magnificent, unfolds around us, a tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, each a potential source of wonder...or annihilation.
