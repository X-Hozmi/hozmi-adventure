
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she crests the windswept hill, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a menacing backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her hand, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Days blur into a tapestry of sun-baked plains, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the harsh realities of a life lived on the unforgiving medieval roads.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the fabled planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp drives hum, gravity shifts subtly, and alien landscapes flash past viewport windows – each a testament to the vastness of the universe and the audacity of human exploration.  The journey is fraught with danger, from unpredictable spatial anomalies to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, but the promise of Aethel fuels her relentless pursuit.
