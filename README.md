
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a fabled trade hub said to hold riches beyond imagining, but the journey was a trial of endurance.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their small party. Yet, with each arduous step, the allure of the unknown fueled their desperate, hopeful advance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out new habitable planets for a desperately overcrowded Earth.  Though the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – the thrill of discovery, the yearning to push the boundaries of the known, echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who dared to traverse unknown lands centuries ago.
