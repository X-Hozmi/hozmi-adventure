
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he’d left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of bandits, wild animals, or worse – the chilling uncertainty of the unknown stretched before him like the endless horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional means.  Her ship, a marvel of faster-than-light technology, leaped across vast interstellar distances, but the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets made every jump a gamble, a thrilling dance on the edge of oblivion.
