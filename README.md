
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the crumpled map, its edges frayed from weeks of relentless travel.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his sister's wasting disease. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval life.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or an abrupt end.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her breath fogging in the zero-gravity mess hall.  The swirling nebula outside, a canvas of cosmic colours, was a breathtaking but familiar sight.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, a constant reminder of the immense distances she traversed, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  The thrill of exploration fueled her, a thirst to discover new worlds and civilizations, tempered by the ever-present dangers of hostile alien life and the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel.
