
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Ahead lay the unknown – a journey across the treacherous Black Forest to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each creak of my saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, wild animals, and impassable terrain were constant companions, yet the lure of Eldoria, a whispered promise of adventure and riches, kept my spirit high and my pace relentless.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves were my highway.  The Althea, my starship, a sliver of polished chrome against the inky blackness, hummed with the power that propelled us across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The destination: Xylos, a planet veiled in mystery and rumored to harbor a sentient energy source unlike any encountered before.   Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of dying suns, and facing the silent, ever-present threat of void-born creatures were daily occurrences, but the promise of Xylos – of discovery and perhaps, even survival –  fueled our relentless journey across the cosmic ocean.
