
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the perils inherent in her quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was brutal, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches in rare minerals.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the tendrils of rogue energy storms was a daily occurrence, a far cry from the romanticized tales of galactic exploration.  The thrill of discovery, however, overshadowed the risks.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space held a siren's call for Razor, a promise of fortune and a legacy etched among the stars.
