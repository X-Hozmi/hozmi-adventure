
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wooden wheels a constant counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of horses’ hooves.  Their destination:  the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in their tales, testing their courage and resourcefulness with every sunrise. Each day brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and the unwavering hope of reaching their fabled goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, his starship *Stardust Drifter* leaping across the void between galaxies.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped nebulae, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of Kryll pirates.  Advanced technology offered a shield against the harsh realities of space, but the vastness and the unknown remained a constant, humbling reminder of humanity's place within the cosmos.  Each jump was a gamble, each new star system a potential treasure trove of discovery or a fatal trap.
