
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, offered little solace against the looming storm clouds.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a city of gold and magic said to be hidden amongst the peaks.  Each creak of the saddle, each stumble of the mule, was a reminder of the perilous undertaking, a testament to the thrill of the unknown that drove her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the ship's controls.  Navigation across the Andromeda galaxy demanded flawless calculations and nerves of steel, a far cry from the simple cartography of Elara's time.  Yet, the underlying impulse remained the same: the insatiable human desire to explore, to push boundaries, to discover the wonders—and dangers—that lie beyond the familiar.  The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and untold riches, a thrilling gamble Eva was willing to take.
