
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his mount onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispering rumors of plague-ridden villages added to the mounting fear. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of exotic spices and untold riches, spurred him onwards, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of crackling energy and the hum of the hyperdrive, a far cry from the medieval knight's arduous trek.  But the dangers were no less real; asteroid fields threatened to shatter her ship, and the vast, uncharted expanse of space held unseen threats.  The allure of discovery, the chance to find a new home for humanity, fuelled her courage, making her a pioneer in the endless, star-dusted frontier.
