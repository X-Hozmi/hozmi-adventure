
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of disease.  Yet, the lure of the legendary lost city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns, pushed her ever forward, a beacon in the vast unknown.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, but also the breathtaking beauty of a world untouched, a world she was determined to conquer.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years away from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  But the promise of a new beginning, of charting humanity's destiny among the stars, fuelled her unwavering resolve, making the unimaginable distances between worlds feel a little less daunting.
