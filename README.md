
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a lost brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, and the whispers of the Black Death loomed larger than any mountain pass.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain trails, bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages, and always, the gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a marathon, not a sprint; months spent battling cosmic storms, repairing hull breaches caused by micrometeoroids, and navigating the treacherous gravitational pull of black holes.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrifying beauty, a stark contrast to the close-knit camaraderie of her crew.  The destination, a rumored lost colony with advanced technology, promised a wealth of knowledge—but reaching it demanded courage and resilience far beyond anything imaginable in the dusty, medieval world.
