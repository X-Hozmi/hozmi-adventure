
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley collection of knights, scholars, and a surprisingly nimble thief, trudged through the muddied tracks of the Rhineland.  Each step brought us closer to the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death that ravaged our homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the constant gnawing of hunger, and the ever-present fear of the unknown lurking in the dark forests and treacherous mountain passes.  The whispered legends of mythical beasts and ancient magic fuelled our determination, a counterpoint to the grim reality of our perilous journey.

Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of cosmic colours.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with sentient flora and hidden dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, yet the risks remained; unpredictable asteroid fields, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms challenged her crew at every turn, making each jump through hyperspace a gamble with the fate of the galaxy.
