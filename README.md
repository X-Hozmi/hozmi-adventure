The dusty track wound relentlessly through the unforgiving landscape, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a constant, menacing presence.

Her mission, far more ambitious than any medieval knight's, was to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with perilous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the void.  Faster-than-light travel offered unparalleled speed, yet the vastness of space, its silent emptiness and unpredictable dangers, presented an adventure of a scale unimaginable to any land-bound adventurer of old.
