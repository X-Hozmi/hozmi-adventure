
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sprawling, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the very elements—scorching sun, torrential rain—threatened to overwhelm them.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for scarce provisions in desolate villages, but the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships was child's play compared to deciphering the ancient alien glyphs that led to the Crystal’s hidden location.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested Rexa's courage and skill at every turn, a journey as far removed from Elara's medieval trek as the stars were from the earth below.
