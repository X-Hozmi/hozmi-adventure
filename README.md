
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the tales of opulent cities and fearsome beasts whispered in taverns along the route. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, seeking a cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the hope of healing fueled his weary bones and spurred him onward, across the vast and unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the ice planet of Kepler-186f, light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace; the vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy presented a far different kind of peril than Thomas had faced. Yet, the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly in Elara's heart as it had in Thomas's, a testament to the enduring human desire to explore the unknown, whether across continents or across cosmos.
