
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious heirloom varieties destined for a monastery nestled in the distant Pyrenees.  Robbers, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the promise of sustenance for the starving monks, and the thrill of the unknown, kept her spirited heart beating strong.  Each sunrise painted a breathtaking canvas across the horizon, a stark contrast to the shadow of fear that often lurked in her weary footsteps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel masked the vastness of space, but the cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders still tested her crew’s courage.  The allure of discovery, however, and the hope of finding a new home for humanity, outweighed the inherent risks of this grand interstellar odyssey.
