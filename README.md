
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, guided his destrier through the muddy track.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort from the horse was a counterpoint to the rustling whispers of the ancient forest.  Their journey to the far north, a perilous quest to find the legendary Sunstone, had already tested their mettle against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road.  The promise of glory, or perhaps just survival, spurred them onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey across the Andromeda galaxy, a mission to retrieve a vital bio-sample, was a constant dance with unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  The cold, sterile hum of the ship's engine was a familiar comfort against the vast, awe-inspiring, and potentially deadly emptiness of space.  The fate of countless worlds rested on her shoulders, a burden carried with the quiet strength of a seasoned explorer.
