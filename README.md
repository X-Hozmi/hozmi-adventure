
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandit raids lurking in shadowed valleys, the treacherous crossings of swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, lending them a mystical, almost menacing quality, while the nights brought the chilling howls of wolves echoing across the vast emptiness.  Our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, felt impossibly distant, a shimmering mirage in the relentless expanse of land.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship powered by captured singularities, cut through the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Our crew, a diverse band of explorers from a dozen worlds, navigated by constellations unseen by human eyes and charted courses through nebulae of breathtaking beauty and terrifying cosmic storms.  The vast emptiness held a different kind of danger – the unpredictable behaviour of wormholes, the silent menace of rogue asteroids, and the always-present possibility of encountering alien civilizations, both friendly and hostile.  Our goal: Kepler-186f, an Earth-like planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from our own, promised untold riches and breathtaking discoveries, far beyond the limitations of our ancestors' terrestrial journeys.
