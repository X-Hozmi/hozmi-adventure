
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of healing the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their resolve hardened by shared hardship and the unwavering belief in their mission.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raids, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the infinite expanse.  But Eva, like Sir Reginald before her, was driven by a sense of purpose, a commitment to reach her destination and fulfill her duty, no matter the cost.
