
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel bulging with questionable herbs and a half-eaten loaf.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the dreaded Black Death.  Her journey to the fabled city of Constantinople, fueled by whispered promises of untold riches and ancient knowledge, was a constant gamble against the brutal realities of medieval travel; a race against time and the relentless march of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kerrigan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, was a treacherous landscape of its own, filled with unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Navigating the galactic currents, dodging cosmic debris, and outsmarting interstellar criminals was a far cry from Elara's arduous land journey, yet both women shared a common spirit: an unwavering thirst for adventure, regardless of the risks.
