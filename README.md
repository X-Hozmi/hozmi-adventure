
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a dense forest, the air thick with the smell of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to possess a relic capable of curing the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of sickness itself.  This journey, fraught with peril, was a testament to his unwavering faith and the desperate hope of his people.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover life beyond Earth, fueled her unwavering determination.  The cosmos, both beautiful and unforgiving, offered a thrilling, and potentially perilous, journey into the unknown.
