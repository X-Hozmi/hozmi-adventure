
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the smooth, paved roads of courtly life.  Bandit-ridden passes, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road tested her resolve daily. Yet, with each sunrise revealing a new vista, each shared meal with a weary traveler, her spirit soared.  The adventure was the reward, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with unimaginable distances and potential hazards.  The ship hummed with the power of its experimental Alcubierre drive, a stark contrast to the creaking wooden wheels of Elara's mule.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos, mirrored the adventurous spirit that drove both women across the vast landscapes of their respective eras.  Each voyage, a testament to the human desire to explore.
