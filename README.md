
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she rides, the relentless sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Her journey across the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed valleys,  storms threaten to sweep her from the narrow paths, and the ever-present hunger gnaws at her belly.  Yet, with each sunrise, she presses onward, fueled by faith and the unwavering hope of reaching her destination.  The tapestry of the medieval world, a vibrant blend of danger and breathtaking beauty, unfolds around her with every mile.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* cuts through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse surrounding them.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of engine failure – the spirit of adventure burns just as brightly.  Ryla and her crew, pioneers in a new age of exploration, push the boundaries of human knowledge, seeking not salvation, but discovery among the celestial wonders of the galaxy.
