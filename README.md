
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only respite the occasional shade of a gnarled olive tree.  Her journey across the Iberian Peninsula was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step. Yet, the promise of reaching the legendary city of Granada, rumored to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of alien gases painted the viewport, a breathtaking yet terrifying spectacle.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the opportunistic raids of space pirates, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to survive the vast emptiness of interstellar space, driven by the hope of finding those lost colonists and unraveling the secrets of their disappearance.
