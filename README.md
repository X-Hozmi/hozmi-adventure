The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each crest offered a breathtaking panorama of untamed wilderness, but also a chilling reminder of the dangers ahead: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous ravines yawning beneath his horse's hooves, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.
