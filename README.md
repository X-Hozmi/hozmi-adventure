
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Each creak of my saddle warned of another mile swallowed by the endless expanse of the Ardennes forest.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were ever-present threats, but the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold forgotten magic, spurred me onward.  The journey was a tapestry woven with fear, camaraderie, and the breathtaking beauty of a world untouched by modern conveniences, a world demanding resilience and resourcefulness at every turn.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside the viewport were far more wondrous, and far less threatening, than any earthly forest.  My mission, to retrieve a vital sample from the Xylos system's gaseous giant, felt less a desperate quest and more a routine task among the stars, though the sheer scale of interstellar travel still held a sense of awe.  While danger lurked in the form of unpredictable spatial anomalies and pirate fleets, the technological sophistication of my ship made the universe feel strangely smaller, yet infinitely more vast.
