
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from easy.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested his resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bartering for meager food, navigating by the stars, and finding shelter from the relentless elements.  Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred him onward, a testament to the enduring human spirit seeking adventure across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system and establish a preliminary colony.  The journey was fraught with perils far removed from Thomas's; navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp drive malfunctions, and battling solar flares were daily occurrences.  Yet, the vast, unexplored expanse of the cosmos held a similar allure – a boundless opportunity for discovery and the exhilarating freedom of pushing humanity's boundaries across the infinite canvas of space.
