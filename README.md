
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of a forgotten god.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in his dogged pursuit of glory and spiritual enlightenment.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his horse, was a testament to the perilous beauty of his medieval odyssey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas, her course plotted to Kepler-186f.  The journey, though spanning lightyears instead of leagues, held a similar thrill.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive were the modern equivalents of medieval dangers.  The lure of discovery – of new life, new technologies, new civilizations – fueled her relentless pursuit of the unknown across the vast, breathtaking expanse of the galaxy.
