
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey across the treacherous Kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of the lost city of Zerzura, a city of gold and unimaginable riches, spurred him on.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience, the hope of discovery a burning flame against the cold reality of the medieval world.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet the journey between galaxies still held its dangers – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of encountering uncharted, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the promise of a new home, a planet teeming with untold resources and mysteries, fuelled her unwavering determination, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the infinite expanse of space.
