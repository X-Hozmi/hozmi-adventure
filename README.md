
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden passes of the Black Mountains was fraught with peril, but the promise of the fabled Sunstone, hidden in a monastery nestled beyond, fueled her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both salvation and death, a constant gamble in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Krell navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane oceans of Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with strange, luminescent flora and potentially hostile lifeforms.  The jump to hyperspace was always a risk, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the void, but the potential rewards, and the thrill of the unknown, were too tempting to resist.
