
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky path a fiery orange.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed ravines, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the whispers of a mythical city, said to hold untold riches and ancient knowledge, spurred her onward, each hardship fueling her unwavering resolve.  The adventure was a gamble, but the potential reward – a life beyond the poverty of her village – was worth the risk.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear. This wasn't the threat of bandits, but the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, a realm where a single miscalculation could mean oblivion.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of pirate attacks and rogue asteroids. Yet, the vastness of space, the thrill of exploring uncharted territories, and the camaraderie of her crew fueled her spirit, making the unimaginable distances feel, somehow, less daunting.
