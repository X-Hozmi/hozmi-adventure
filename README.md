
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack mules and weary men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the endless steppe, and the ever-present fear of the plague that stalks the land like a shadow.  Yet, we press on, driven by the whispered promise of the Silk Road’s treasures and the hope of a future beyond the dust and despair of our present.  The shimmering mirage of a distant oasis offers fleeting comfort, a temporary reprieve from the relentless journey.

Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* leaps across the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova guides her crew through nebulae painted across the cosmos, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the gravitational pulls of uncharted planets.  The thrill of discovery, the awe-inspiring beauty of the universe, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive motor fuel their relentless exploration.  Their quest: to find a habitable world for a dying Earth, a pilgrimage far grander than any medieval pilgrimage, fraught with dangers both known and unknown in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
