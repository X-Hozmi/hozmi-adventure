
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril from brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of the medieval world and the epic adventure he had undertaken.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent gases painting the cockpit in breathtaking hues.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining resources to the colonized planet Kepler-186f, a journey across light-years that pushed the boundaries of human ingenuity.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant shimmer of distant galaxies, held a majesty and a terror all its own, a stark contrast to the medieval knight's struggle, yet equally demanding of courage and resilience.
