
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the parched landscape, the midday sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a fabled metropolis said to hold secrets older than the kingdom itself.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were only some of the trials she faced on her perilous journey; each sunrise brought a fresh gamble with fate as she pushed onward, fueled by hope and the unshakeable belief in her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were just a few of the hazards of interstellar travel.  Yet, with every jump, every near-miss, Nova felt the thrill of the unknown, the exhilarating pulse of discovery propelling her forward towards the edges of the galaxy.
