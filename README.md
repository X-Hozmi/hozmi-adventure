
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered of in hushed tones, said to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of adventure, the whisper of Eldoria, pushed her onward, a tiny speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey was perilous, fraught with asteroid fields, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on vulnerable transports.  But the promise of a new life, a new beginning on a pristine world, fueled her crew’s courage.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, but the intrepid explorers pressed on, a tiny ship against the immensity of the cosmos.
