
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought the promise of new danger, each sunset the weary satisfaction of another league traversed towards his elusive goal. The journey itself was an adventure, a tapestry woven from hardship and hope, etched against the stark backdrop of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter.' Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-jump malfunction.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space presented a different kind of peril than Thomas faced, but the thrill of discovery, the relentless pursuit of a distant hope, remained the same timeless engine of adventure.
