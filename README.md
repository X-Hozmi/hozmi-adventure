
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the harsher realities of famine and disease. Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils – spatial anomalies, pirate raids, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space.  But the siren call of discovery, the promise of finding her people, outweighed the risks, propelling her across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
