
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's boots as she trudges across the parched plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel bulging with meager supplies.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of losing her way. Yet, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the key to her family's lost fortune, fuels her onward.  The journey is arduous, a tapestry woven with breathtaking landscapes, perilous river crossings, and the kindness of strangers encountered along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Galaxies stretch before her like an endless cosmic ocean, each star a potential destination, each jump a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, face challenges as daunting as any medieval knight:  malfunctioning hyperdrives, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of resource depletion in the vast emptiness between worlds.  But the lure of discovering new civilizations and charting unmapped territories drives them forward, each jump a leap into the unknown.
