
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience, the vast unknown unfolding before her with each step.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the discovery of new worlds – vibrant alien ecosystems teeming with strange and wonderful life, each planet a canvas painted with the hues of the cosmos.  The thrill of charting unmapped territories, the exhilaration of encountering the unknown, echoed the spirit of those medieval pilgrims, separated by time but united by an unyielding thirst for exploration.
