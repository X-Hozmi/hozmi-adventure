
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each creak of saddle leather and beat of his horse's hooves, his determination burned brighter, fueled by faith and the promise of adventure beyond the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane connecting the Andromeda galaxy to the far reaches of the known universe.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was child's play compared to the cosmic anomalies that lurked in the uncharted depths.  But Eva, with her seasoned crew and advanced technology, pushed further into the unknown, her heart pounding with the thrill of discovery and the weight of responsibility for the future of interstellar exploration.
