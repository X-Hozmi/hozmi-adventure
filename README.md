
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Anatolia in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream – a map leading to the legendary city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable riches and even more unimaginable dangers.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the whispered promises of Zerzura fueled her onward, a flickering flame in the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the colossal starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to chart the newly-discovered Xylos system, a cluster rumored to contain planets with life-sustaining atmospheres.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates, Jax and her crew faced dangers far removed from the medieval traveler's concerns, but the thrill of discovery, the yearning to push the boundaries of the known universe, burned just as brightly in their hearts as the flame of Elara's desperate hope.
