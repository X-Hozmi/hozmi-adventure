
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista – rolling hills giving way to dense forests, then stark, windswept plains.  My journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows, storms threatened to sweep me from my path, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each league traversed, a fierce satisfaction bloomed, a testament to human endurance against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars are my highway.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive is a lullaby as we jump between galaxies, each jump a dizzying leap across unimaginable distances.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life. The dangers are different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the thrill of exploration, the yearning to uncover the unknown, remains the same potent force that drove the medieval pilgrims, a shared human desire to push beyond the horizon, regardless of the epoch.
