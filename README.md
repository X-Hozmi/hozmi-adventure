
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, guided her mule along a barely-there track.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching sun, and treacherous sand dunes were her constant companions, yet the allure of untold riches and legendary artifacts spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought the possibility of discovery, each sunset the gnawing threat of failure, but the thrill of the unknown fueled her relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  But the promise of unlocking the secrets of the galaxy, and expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, made the risks worthwhile.
