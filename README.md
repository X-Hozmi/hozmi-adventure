
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present dust that coats everything, blurring the horizon into a hazy mirage.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown drives us onward – a quest for the mythical City of Zerzura, a fabled oasis rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  The rough-hewn map, passed down through generations, is our only guide, its faded ink a testament to the perilous journeys undertaken by those who came before.

Fast forward centuries:  The stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship capable of warping through spacetime, carries me and my crew across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  We navigate asteroid fields, evade the gravitational pull of black holes, and face the alien landscapes of uncharted planets, each more bizarre and breathtaking than the last.  Our mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, whispered to contain the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The cosmic expanse holds both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, a gamble worth taking for the sake of galactic exploration.
