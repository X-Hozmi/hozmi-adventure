
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in her quest; the thrill of the unknown, the allure of discovery, spurred her onward through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace for her seasoned crew.  Their mission: to locate a fabled planet whispered to possess a source of limitless energy.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, held dangers far more profound than any earthly bandit.  Yet, the promise of revolutionizing galactic civilization outweighed the risks, driving Ryla and her crew deeper into the cosmic unknown.
