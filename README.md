
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey.  The whispers of Eldoria fueled his resolve, painting visions of salvation in a world choked by despair.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos reflecting in the viewport of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*. Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Sol system, braving the unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Advanced technology offered a degree of safety, but the vast, uncharted expanse of space held its own dangers, the loneliness of interstellar travel a constant weight against the weight of her responsibility.
