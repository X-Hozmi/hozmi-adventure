
The year is 1348.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traverse the snow-dusted mountains.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend promising untold riches and a refuge from the plague sweeping across the land.  Each creak of my pack, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels a mixture of fear and exhilaration.  Every sunrise brings the possibility of bandits, starvation, or worse, but the lure of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, drives me onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a soothing counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness of intergalactic space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the discovery of a new lifeform.  Though the journey is measured in light-years, the sense of adventure is no less potent.  The danger is different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien species – but the thrill of exploration, the pushing of boundaries, remains a constant, a burning star in the vast cosmic night.
