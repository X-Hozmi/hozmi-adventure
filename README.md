A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the creak of his saddle and the gnawing hunger in his belly.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, fueled his weary body and resolute spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery.  Navigation through uncharted star systems, dodging asteroid fields and avoiding the hostile Zydonian patrols, tested her skill and nerve to the limit. But the allure of discovering a new world, a chance to unravel the colony's disappearance, was a siren song she couldn't resist.
