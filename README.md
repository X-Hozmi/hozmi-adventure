Her journey from York to Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands brimming with exotic spices and whispered tales of ancient wonders, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new opportunity to test her courage and resilience.
