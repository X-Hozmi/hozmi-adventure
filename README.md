
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing the precarious route to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements were constant threats, but the whispers of Eldoria’s untold riches fueled his weary steps. Each creaking wagon wheel and distant hawk cry marked a step further into the unknown, a symphony of both peril and thrilling anticipation.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a comforting drone in the vast, star-dusted canvas of space. Captain Eva Rostova navigated through the swirling nebula, her gaze fixed on the coordinates leading to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different now—void storms, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of the unknown, the boundless possibilities of the cosmos, remained the same driving force that propelled explorers across time and space.
