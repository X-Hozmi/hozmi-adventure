
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey from Canterbury to Rome was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder;  the treacherous, muddy roads, the kindness of strangers in isolated villages offering meager meals and shelter, the awe-inspiring sight of the Alps rising like jagged teeth against the sky. Each day brought the potential for bandit encounters, famine, or unexpected beauty, forging her into a woman as resilient and rugged as the landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane connecting the Andromeda galaxy to the Milky Way.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes glimpsed on distant planets, the thrill of navigating treacherous asteroid fields – these were her challenges.  Yet, even across the gulf of millennia, the spirit of adventure remained the same: a thirst for the unknown, a push against the boundaries of the possible, a willingness to face the dangers to claim the rewards of discovery.
