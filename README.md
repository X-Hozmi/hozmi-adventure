
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or danger.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of forgotten castles, and the whispers of mythical beasts echoed in the wind.  Her quest: to find the lost city of Eldoria, a legendary place rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  The journey was perilous, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, yet the lure of discovery spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expansion.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap into the unknown, potentially encountering alien civilizations – benevolent or hostile.  The vastness of space held both incredible beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of the known universe, fueled her relentless journey across the cosmic ocean.
