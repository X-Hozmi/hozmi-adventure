Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at both the beauty and danger of this untamed land – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed every mile.  He pressed on, fueled by hope and a desperate yearning for a future beyond the encroaching death.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours – amethyst, sapphire, and emerald – were breathtaking, a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with the risks of asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  The vast emptiness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, yet the lure of discovery burned brighter than any star.
