
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll; the once-bright colours of his banner were now faded and dust-caked, mirroring the weariness in his heart. Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a swamp whispered to swallow men whole, a fitting metaphor for the perilous quest that had led him across kingdoms and mountains, a journey spurred by the promise of a mythical artifact said to hold the power to heal his ailing Queen. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, held the thrill of the unknown – and the gnawing fear of the unseen.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Years she'd spent charting the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, her mission a search for habitable worlds beyond the known colonies.  The thrill of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena unseen by human eyes before – these fueled her relentless journey, tempered only by the ever-present dangers of asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the looming threat of the Kryll, a sentient space-faring species whose intentions toward humanity remained unknown. Each jump through hyperspace, each scan of a new planet, represented a leap of faith into the vast, unknowable expanse.
