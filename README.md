
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on the endless expanse of the Salisbury Plain.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the constant gnawing hunger of the road. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's splendor, and the desperate hope for his sister's recovery, fueled his unwavering determination to press on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raiders in sleek, black ships, and battling the relentless cosmic radiation were all in a day's work.  But the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the thrill of exploring uncharted systems, and the knowledge that her cargo might save a civilization, made the risks worthwhile. The vastness of space was a daunting challenge, yet it held the same irresistible allure as the medieval roads – a promise of adventure and the possibility of discovery.
