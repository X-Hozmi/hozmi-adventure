
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a tapestry of sights and smells clinging to our worn leather jerkins.  Each creak of our wagon wheels spoke of the miles yet to conquer – the treacherous passes of the Alps, the sun-baked plains of Italy, the whispering forests of the Holy Land.  Every sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown, the fear of bandits, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet the lure of the East, the promise of spices and silks, propelled us onward, a band of weary but determined souls seeking fortune and adventure in a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our roadways.  The sleek crimson hull of the *Starseeker* hummed beneath us as we warped through the void between galaxies, leaving behind the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  The breathtaking nebulae painted across the cosmos were a constant reminder of the immense scale of our undertaking, and the advanced technology that shrunk the distances between worlds.  Yet even amongst the wonders of faster-than-light travel, the old human thirst for the unknown remained, a burning desire for discovery that transcends time and space.
