
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Castile in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of famine.  Yet, the whispered promises of Eldoria, and the desperate hope for her brother's survival, fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the breathtaking, and terrifying, expanse of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, cut a lonely path through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and charting unmapped nebulae, Ryla and her crew faced the unimaginable vastness of space, the chilling isolation of interstellar travel, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena.  But the faint signal, a whisper from a lost world, spurred them on, a beacon of hope amidst the breathtaking, terrifying grandeur of the cosmos.
