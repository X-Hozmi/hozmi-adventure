
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed on, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust that swirled like vengeful spirits.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, fueled their weary steps.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and camaraderie, a testament to human endurance in a world brimming with both peril and wonder.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highways.  Captain Elara, at the helm of the 'Stardust Wanderer', navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of space. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of cosmic storms, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the vastness of space held a beauty that mirrored the intrepid spirit of those who dared to traverse it.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and indomitable spirit.
