Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant companions on this arduous journey across the heart of Europe.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on him, but the weight of responsibility, and the promise of untold riches, propelled him forward through the cosmic void.
