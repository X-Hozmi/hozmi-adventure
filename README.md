
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was proving far more perilous than anticipated; bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the biting wind threatened to freeze them solid.  Yet, the whispers of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her on, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.  Each creak of saddle leather, each pounding hoofbeat, was a step closer to destiny, or perhaps, ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', through a nebula of breathtaking iridescent hues.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a meticulously planned affair, charting a course through unmapped asteroid fields and navigating the gravitational pull of distant suns.  The thrill wasn't merely in the destination – a rumoured planet teeming with Xylos crystals, invaluable to their dwindling energy reserves – but in the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos, a testament to humanity's relentless curiosity and the boundless wonders waiting to be discovered beyond their own solar system.
