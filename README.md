
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumours of exotic spices and silks whispered in taverns back in London.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, promised hardship and uncertainty, a relentless test of endurance against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking views of celestial bodies born and dying in the vast emptiness of space.  Her mission, a scientific survey, was fraught with danger – unpredictable asteroid fields, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life. Yet, the thrill of exploration, of charting the uncharted, fuelled her unwavering determination.
