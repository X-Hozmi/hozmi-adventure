
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the whispered promise of Zerzura fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  A single navigational error could strand them lightyears from civilization, lost in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  Yet, the weight of responsibility, the hope for a thriving colony, and the endless beauty of the galaxy kept her hand steady on the controls.
