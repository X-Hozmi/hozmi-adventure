
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The rutted track snaked through a forest primeval, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation spurred him on, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, a tapestry woven from warp jumps and asteroid fields, was a constant battle against the unforgiving vastness of space.  System failures, pirate attacks, and the creeping loneliness of interstellar travel tested her crew's resilience. Yet, the promise of a new beginning, a chance to build a future amongst the stars, ignited a fierce determination within her, making the unimaginable voyage worthwhile.
