
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or unforeseen peril. The journey was fraught with hardship, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward through treacherous forests, across raging rivers, and over unforgiving mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies in search of habitable worlds for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Facing unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure, Elara and her crew braved the uncharted depths of space, their courage fueled by the hope of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
