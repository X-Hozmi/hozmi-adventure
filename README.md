
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the harsh realities of medieval travel; a journey measured not in miles, but in the resilience of both man and beast, the kindness of strangers, and the relentless gnawing of uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faintly detected amidst the cosmic static.  The journey, measured in light years, was a relentless dance with hyperspace jumps, navigating asteroid fields, and evading the predatory warships of the Kryll Hegemony.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking wonder and terrifying isolation, a stark contrast to the medieval traveler's more grounded, albeit equally perilous, path.  The ultimate prize, however, was the same: discovery, knowledge, and the enduring human spirit's relentless push into the unknown.
