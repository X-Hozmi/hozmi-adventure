
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the sky, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, and the possibility of glory spurred him on, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped celestial bodies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Advanced technology offered some protection, but the vastness of space, the isolation, and the sheer audacity of the expedition fueled a sense of adventure as thrilling and perilous as any medieval knight's quest.  The stars were her battlefield, and the cosmos her kingdom to explore.
