
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of a distant city shimmering in the midday heat.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried rations and a worn map; it holds the hope of finding her brother, lost somewhere in the sprawling, bandit-ridden expanse of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each cautious step across treacherous terrain, fuels her determination, a journey fueled by sisterly love and the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, stranded somewhere in the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space is a daunting prospect, the dangers of cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormholes a constant threat. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of new discoveries and the possibility of bringing lost souls home, drives Eva forward – a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for adventure amongst the stars.
