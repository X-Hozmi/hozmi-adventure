
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a fabled metropolis said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges facing Thomas and his small band of companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought new peril, but the lure of the unknown fueled their relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory space pirates known as the Crimson Claw, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to survive. The vastness of space presented challenges beyond imagining, but the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f spurred them onward, a testament to human resilience in the face of interstellar danger.
