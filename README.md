
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension.  He carried a king's ransom – and a king's wrath – if he failed to deliver the sacred relic to Avignon before the coming winter. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions on this perilous pilgrimage across the heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of dying stars and the occasional meteor shower, offered both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying isolation.  Navigation charts were unreliable, alien life forms a constant possibility, and the pressure of the mission weighed heavily on her crew as they navigated the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
