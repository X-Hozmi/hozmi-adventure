
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  He rode not only for himself, but for his people.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Prime, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, and the ship shuddered as it jumped between star systems, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate incursions.  The vast emptiness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, held both the promise of discovery and the ever-present threat of cosmic horrors.  Lyra, a seasoned explorer, pressed on, driven by the hope of finding a lost civilization and fulfilling her solemn oath to rescue them.
