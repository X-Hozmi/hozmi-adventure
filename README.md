
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on their journey across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads, a city said to hold the secret to unimaginable power.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous sandstorms, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the lure of legend spurred him onward, a flickering ember of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and distorted, its origin a mystery. Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the threat of pirate raiders a constant concern.  But the potential discovery of new technologies, new worlds, and the chance to reunite a lost civilization fueled her determination, making the vast emptiness of space a canvas for her intrepid journey.
