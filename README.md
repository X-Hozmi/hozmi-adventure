
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a tattered banner.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness of the Ardennes, a tapestry of shadowed forests and treacherous bogs whispered to be haunted by wild beasts and brigands.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of peril and the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Survival meant relying on wits, courage, and the kindness – or indifference – of strangers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of crimson and emerald gas clouds, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes. Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding pinpoint navigation through asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational wells. Unlike the medieval traveler, Eva commanded technology that defied the limitations of time and distance, but the risks remained: unforeseen celestial events, equipment malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations.
