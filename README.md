
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried apricots, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unknown dangers that lay ahead.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, for terror, or both.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse. Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with potential encounters with alien civilizations – some friendly, some undoubtedly hostile.  Navigation through asteroid fields, navigating wormholes, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure were just a few of the hazards she faced in her pursuit of the unknown. The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, both captivated and threatened her in equal measure.
