
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the vast, untamed expanse of the Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother’s wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers and the promise of adventure that lay ahead on her perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and search for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vast distances and unpredictable cosmic phenomena still held a palpable sense of adventure. Each jump to hyperspace, each encounter with alien lifeforms, whether friendly or hostile, was a gamble, a thrilling test of skill and courage in the boundless expanse of the galaxy.
