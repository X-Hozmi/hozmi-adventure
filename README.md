
Sir Gareth, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The dust of the King's Road clung to everything, a fine grit coating his lips and stinging his eyes.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen Orb of Aethelred – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across roaring rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in the shadows, wild beasts prowling in the undergrowth, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the Orb, imagined in his mind's eye, fueled his relentless journey.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and establish first contact.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal mistress, the jump-gates spitting the ship out into unpredictable gravitational fields.  Navigating asteroid belts, dodging rogue energy bursts, and battling cosmic storms were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva. The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness than Gareth had ever known - a silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms. Yet, the hope of finding life beyond Earth pushed her onward, just as the Orb had driven Gareth.
