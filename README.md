
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the sickness itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against time and the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula’s iridescent haze, its hyperdrive humming a song of cosmic power.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap – a technology capable of bridging the vast chasm between galaxies.  But Xylos was also known for its treacherous gravitational currents and the enigmatic Xylarion race, fiercely protective of their secrets.  Ryla's crew braced themselves, knowing their mission was a perilous dance on the edge of the unknown.
