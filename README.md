
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking deep in the mire.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was proving far more arduous than the grizzled old cartographer had foretold.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and starvation gnawed at the edges of her resolve. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, with its promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to overcome the perils of the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million burning suns.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a calculated risk, a perilous voyage through uncharted wormholes and treacherous asteroid fields.  But the potential discovery of a new habitable planet, a world teeming with life unlike anything encountered before, far outweighed the dangers. The vast expanse of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held the promise of a new dawn for humanity, a future written in the constellations above.
