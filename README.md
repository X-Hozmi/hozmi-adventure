
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their battered packhorses strained under the weight of supplies and the ever-present fear of bandits.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of a powerful ancient civilization. The journey was a brutal tapestry woven with sun-scorched days, freezing nights, and skirmishes with desperate outlaws, but the lure of the unknown fueled their weary steps, each sunrise a promise of discovery and danger in equal measure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Elara, at the helm of the starship *Stardust*, navigated the treacherous nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light-years and through gravitational maelstroms.  The mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a dying Earth.  Her crew, a diverse collection of specialists, faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers: rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of system malfunctions.  Yet, the hope of a new dawn for humanity spurred them onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the vast, unforgiving, and awe-inspiring expanse of the cosmos.
