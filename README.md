
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the creak of her worn leather saddlebags.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to swallow unwary travellers whole, and beyond that, the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists.  Each bend in the rutted track held a new challenge: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, pushed her relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust Drifter* sliced through the inky void between galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known cosmos, navigated by the faint whispers of quasars and the shimmering trails of nebulae.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in legend, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, and the boundless expanse of the universe, fueled their unwavering ambition.
