The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through a forest haunted by whispers of goblins and worse.  His quest – to recover the stolen Sunstone – led him across treacherous mountain passes, through fetid swamps teeming with disease, and past crumbling ruins that hinted at forgotten empires.  Each sunrise brought new peril, each sunset a renewed hope for reaching the sorcerer’s hidden fortress before winter’s icy grip claimed him.

A thousand lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Cosmic rays crackled against the hull as she charted a course through asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris left by ancient, forgotten wars.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and rescue its inhabitants from a mysterious plague.  The vast emptiness of space held both unimaginable beauty and deadly threats, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the universe.
