
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward across the muddy track.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging to sheer cliffs, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our destination, the mythical city of Ys, fuelled our aching limbs and dwindling hope.  Tales of its unimaginable wealth and wonders spurred us on, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness of medieval Europe.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, both thrilling and terrifying.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Beyond the familiar constellations lay uncharted territories – potentially rich with new resources, teeming with alien civilizations, or harboring dangers beyond human comprehension.  The vastness of the cosmos stretched before them, a limitless canvas of adventure, where the only certainty was the constant thrill of discovery and the ever-present risk of annihilation.
