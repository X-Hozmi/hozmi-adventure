
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest, a perilous journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, had already claimed two men to fever and another to bandit ambush.  Each creak of their pack animals, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers – both human and natural – lurking in the vast, untamed landscape.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant horizon, making the path ahead seem both impossibly long and alluringly close.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of swirling nebulae and distant, uncharted star systems.  Their mission: to locate and secure a potential habitable planet for a rapidly expanding human colony.  While lacking the immediate, visceral threats of Kaelan’s journey, Eva faced dangers equally profound – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the potential for hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present pressure of a desperate race against time and dwindling resources.
