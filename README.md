
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The whispers of Ys, a beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness of the Black Death, fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded light years from known space.  The vastness of the cosmos, peppered with shimmering constellations and the looming threat of uncharted space anomalies, presented a challenge unlike any she'd faced.  Faster-than-light travel meant traversing unimaginable distances, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  The fate of a generation rested on her shoulders, and the allure of discovery, mingled with the chilling possibility of failure, kept her hand steady on the controls.
