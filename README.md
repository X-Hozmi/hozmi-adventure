
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Woods, legendary for its brigands and mythical beasts.  Her quest: to reach the distant city of Porthaven, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a constant reminder of the perilous journey and the unwavering hope fueling her steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant on the fringes of known space.  The swirling colours of the nebula masked potential dangers – pirate ships, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  With her crew relying on her skill and her AI navigating the treacherous cosmic currents, Eva pressed onward, the vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy both thrilling and terrifying.
