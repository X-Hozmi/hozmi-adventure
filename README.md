
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea to the distant King for aid against a relentless famine.  Each creak of the cart, each wary glance at the horizon, was a testament to the perilous journey ahead.  Bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous pilgrimage across the fractured lands of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in the sleek, silver hull of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a speck of humanity clinging to survival amidst the cosmic expanse.  Warp drives hummed, stars streaked past like fallen embers, and the weightless silence of deep space pressed against him.  The vastness of the universe, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the immense risk, and the equally immense reward, that lay at the end of his interstellar voyage.
