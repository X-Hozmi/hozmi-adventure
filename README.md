
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward through the muddy track.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort from our exhausted mounts, echoed the perilous journey ahead.  We'd braved bandit ambushes in the Black Forest, forded raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the sun seemed a distant memory.  The whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, with its rumored treasures and ancient magic, fueled our relentless push across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through our bones as we hurtled across the vast gulf between galaxies.  Nebulae painted the void in breathtaking hues, while distant, swirling galaxies appeared as shimmering islands in a cosmic sea. Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel and unlock the secrets of a long-lost civilization. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a thrilling leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential reward far outweighed the risk.
