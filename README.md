
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the treacherous mountain passes offered little respite from the biting wind, and the whispers of mythical creatures lurking in the deep forests fueled her fear as much as her determination. Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the freedom of the open road, spurred her onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos reflecting in the viewport of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Wormhole jumps were unpredictable, risking catastrophic spatial distortions, and the vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – derelict ships, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to rewrite history, propelled him and his crew deeper into the uncharted cosmos.
