The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, was a far cry from the king's paved roads.  Each bend held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse – but the lure of the legendary Sword of Aethelred, rumored to be hidden within the ancient Druid ruins, spurred him on.
