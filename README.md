
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried meats and meager coins; it contains a map – a whispered promise of a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are just some of the trials she must face on this desperate journey across the heart of medieval Europe, a pilgrimage fueled by unwavering sibling love.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Warp drives hum, alien landscapes flash by, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders stalks her journey across the galaxies, a relentless pursuit in the face of unimaginable distances and perilous encounters.
