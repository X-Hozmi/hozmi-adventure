
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed like a malevolent specter. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the constant gnawing hunger. But the unwavering faith in her heart, and the companionship of fellow travelers, fuelled her onward, each day a chapter in a grand, uncertain adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the harsh, ice-covered planet of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and contending with unpredictable wormhole currents were mere inconveniences compared to the bureaucratic red tape and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic wonders, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, shaping Eva's journey into a saga of interstellar resilience and the unwavering human spirit.
