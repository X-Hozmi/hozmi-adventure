
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary steed as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, her resolve strengthens, fueled by the hope of reunion and the thrill of the unknown that lies ahead, beyond each sun-drenched hill and rushing river.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the crimson light of a binary sunset.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey for habitable worlds, a journey fraught with dangers far beyond those faced by medieval travelers.  Wormholes spit them across vast distances, nebulae shimmer like celestial tapestries, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive masks the silence of space.  Yet, the vastness and potential for discovery, the chance to encounter new life and unravel cosmic mysteries, fuels the brave crew of the *Stardust* as they push the boundaries of human exploration, across the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
