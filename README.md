
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes her mule further across the unforgiving plains.  The parchment clutched in her hand, detailing the rumored location of the lost city of Zerzura, is her only guide.  Bandits, scorching heat, and treacherous terrain are constant threats, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels her onward. Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers and breathtaking landscapes – a rocky pass overlooking a vast desert, a hidden oasis teeming with life, the eerie silence of a forgotten ruin.  This is the thrill of medieval adventure, a gamble played against the elements and the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rex navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only lead.  Wormholes, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace are his everyday challenges.  Alien encounters, both benevolent and hostile, punctuate his journey, each interaction a potential key to his success or his demise.  This is the ultimate adventure, a quest across the unimaginable distances of space, a voyage into the very heart of the unknown.
