
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward. The rough track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of unease. He carried a king's decree, a perilous mission to forge an alliance with a distant, untamed tribe beyond the mountains, a journey fraught with danger from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and seek out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival. Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms, pirate raiders, and the sheer vastness of space itself presented a constant challenge. The adventure lay not just in the destination, but in the perilous journey between the stars.
