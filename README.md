Ahead lay the vast, unknown expanse of the  Kingdom of Eldoria, a land rumored to hold both untold riches and unspeakable dangers.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the obstacles she faced, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel. Her quest, to find a legendary healing herb, spurred her onward, the thrill of the unknown outweighing the peril.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, cursing the fluctuating wormhole jump.  Their freighter, the *Stardust Drifter*, lurched violently as they transitioned between galaxies, the kaleidoscopic swirls of space a mesmerizing yet terrifying sight.

Pirate raiders were notorious in these sectors, and the thrill of the chase, the gamble against intergalactic piracy, kept Rexx's adrenaline surging. The cosmos were a vast, unforgiving frontier, but the potential rewards were astronomical.
