The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the thorns and mud.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Morwenna – pushed him further, ignoring the gnawing hunger and the whispers of unseen dangers lurking in the shadowy depths.
