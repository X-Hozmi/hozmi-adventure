
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the plague.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery at Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting kindnesses offered by weary travelers and secluded villages, a test of endurance against a backdrop of medieval uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst swirling cosmic dust and vibrant, alien planets.  Her mission, far removed from Elara's personal struggle, was to chart unexplored sectors for the Galactic Federation, facing the perils of unmapped wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from civilization.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was as isolating and dangerous as any medieval wilderness.
