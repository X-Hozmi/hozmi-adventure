
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom – not in gold, but in seeds of a rumored miracle crop, vital to a famine-stricken village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandit or beast, testing her courage and resourcefulness on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The path ahead was uncertain, a tapestry woven with hope and the very real threat of death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, she dodged asteroid fields and dodged the gravity wells of dying suns.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and said to hold the key to interstellar travel's next breakthrough.  The vastness of space, with its breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, held both unparalleled opportunity and the ever-present danger of cosmic radiation, rogue planets, and the silent, watchful emptiness of the galaxy.
