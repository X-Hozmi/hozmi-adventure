
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the dry grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the whispered rumors of a lost city, a city brimming with forgotten magic, propelled her onward.  The distant peaks of the Pyrenees loomed, formidable yet enticing, promising both peril and untold reward.  Her journey was a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate, a tapestry woven with sweat, fear, and the burning desire for discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Jax hurled his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory warships of the Kryll Hegemony was all in a day's work.  The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the risk.  The galaxy was a vast, uncharted ocean, and Jax, with his trusty crew and their battered vessel, were intrepid explorers charting its unknown depths, one risky hyperspace jump at a time.
