
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and whispers of the Black Death followed her like a phantom. Yet, with each sunrise, a new vista unfolded, each hardship forged a deeper resolve in her weary heart, the adventure a testament to human endurance and the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids were everyday occurrences.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond any medieval traveler could imagine, yet the thrill of discovery, the promise of finding those lost souls, fueled her courage as she steered her ship across the cosmic sea, towards the edge of known space.
