
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, spurred his destrier onwards.  Ahead, the treacherous Black Forest loomed, a labyrinth of shadowed paths and whispered legends.  He carried with him King Edward's decree, a mission fraught with peril: to secure a vital alliance with a remote highland clan, a journey that would test his courage, his loyalty, and the very limits of human endurance.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the obstacles standing between him and his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Warp drives hummed, navigating asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Alien encounters – some friendly, some hostile – punctuated the voyage, testing not only Eva’s navigational skills but her ability to forge alliances amidst the vast, uncharted territories of the cosmos.
