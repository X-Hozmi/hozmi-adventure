
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, had already tested their mettle against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the relentless sun. Each day brought a new challenge: navigating by the stars, foraging for food, and always, the ever-present threat of the unknown lurking in the vast, untamed wilderness.  The whispered tales of Eldoria's riches and ancient magic fueled their weary bodies, promising a reward worth the perilous undertaking.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her breath misting in the low-gravity cabin.  The jump to Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy, had been smoother than expected, but the real adventure lay ahead.  Xylos, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna, and rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, awaited exploration.  Her crew, a diverse team of xeno-biologists, engineers, and security specialists, were ready to face the dangers of alien landscapes and potentially hostile lifeforms, driven by the same thirst for discovery that had motivated explorers for millennia.
