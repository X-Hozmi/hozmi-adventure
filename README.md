
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the parched landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows from the skeletal branches of dead trees.  Her journey from Canterbury to Rome, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need for escape, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions.  Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each weary mile a testament to her resilience.  The whispered tales of miracles at Rome spurred her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, CORA, calmly reporting on the fluctuating gravitational fields.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a task demanding courage, precision, and a tolerance for the infinite expanse of space.  The breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies – pulsars and quasars, nebulae painted across the void – filled Eva with awe, a stark contrast to the calculated risks and the ever-present threat of encountering unforeseen anomalies or hostile alien life. The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, was a constant reminder of humanity's boundless curiosity and relentless pursuit of the unknown.
