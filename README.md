The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering forests of Eldoria, promising both peril and untold riches.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the whispers of mythical beasts echoed in the night, and the very landscape itself seemed to conspire against their journey – treacherous mountains, raging rivers, and swamps choked with noxious vegetation all lay between him and the legendary Sunstone.
