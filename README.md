
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the whispering wheat fields, stretched before him, a ribbon leading towards the unknown. Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic and untold riches, had lured him from his castle walls.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk circling overhead, fueled the thrill of the unknown, the risk of bandits, and the tantalizing promise of glory that lay beyond the horizon.  He carried only his sword, his wits, and a map older than his grandfather.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was risky, the coordinates uncertain.  But the potential reward – unlocking interstellar exploration for humanity – outweighed the danger of rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, or even the complete annihilation of her vessel.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and the irresistible pull of discovery, driving Eva and her crew towards the far reaches of the galaxy.
