
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need to escape a crumbling marriage, was far from glamorous.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the nights were cold and unforgiving, and the meager rations she carried dwindled with each passing day. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown propelled her forward, each bend in the road promising new encounters and the potential for both danger and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star cruiser a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey that would test the limits of both his ship and his crew.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, alien lifeforms unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions loomed large.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the galaxy, outweighed the risks. The cosmos beckoned, a vast and unforgiving ocean, yet one teeming with untold wonders.
