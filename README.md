The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, promised adventure – and peril.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age,  a promise of a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Eldoria, a journey far more treacherous than any battlefield.  His quest was a gamble, fueled by whispered legends and a thirst for glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory spacefaring Kryll was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political intrigue surrounding the planet's colonization efforts.  But the allure of discovering new life, new civilizations, and charting unmapped sectors of the galaxy propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer facing challenges as daunting as any knight errant of old.
