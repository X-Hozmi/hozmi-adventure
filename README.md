
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the sea clinging to our roughspun tunics.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees mountains, then the sun-baked plains of Castile, each step a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Our mule train, laden with silks and spices, creaked and groaned under the weight of our ambitions – to reach the fabled markets of Baghdad, a journey fraught with peril, yet promising unimaginable riches.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to our resilience.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we traverse the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to chart unexplored systems, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach.  The risks are cosmic – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. But the promise of discovery, of charting the very edges of existence, fuels our relentless pursuit across the vast, silent expanse of space.
