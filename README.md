
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward, her resolve hardened by every hardship overcome.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of bridging galaxies.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Ryla, fueled by the potential for interstellar peace, expertly piloted her vessel, charting a course through the uncharted cosmos, each jump a gamble against the infinite possibilities of the unknown.
