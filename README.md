
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully beneath the relentless sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Pyrenees Mountains.  Each pass held the promise of both breathtaking vista and deadly ambush; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey from the English court to the Holy Land.  His quest, a pilgrimage tinged with a desperate hope of redemption, was as vast and uncertain as the landscape itself.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant colony on Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the alien beauty of the cosmos, a stark contrast to the ancient perils faced by her medieval counterparts.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure, the drive to explore the unknown, burned just as brightly in Elara's heart as it had in Sir Reginald’s.
