
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his mount onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire as he traversed the treacherous mountain passes, his small band of companions a blur of sweat and steel behind him.  Their quest: to recover the lost relic of St. Jude, whispered to hold the power to heal the plague sweeping across the land.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush, for bandits, or for the supernatural horrors rumored to dwell in the shadowed forests.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a polyglot assembly of humans and Xylarans, monitored the warp drive as they jumped between galaxies, chasing the faint signal of a lost colony ship.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and breathtaking canvas of stars and cosmic dust, held both the promise of discovery and the chilling threat of unknown celestial phenomena.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.
