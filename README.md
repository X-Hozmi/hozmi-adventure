
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, spurred him onward, a solitary figure against the vast, untamed landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust', a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human population of Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and alien encounters a constant threat.  But the vastness of space, the shimmering nebulae, and the hope of finding a new home propelled her forward.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
