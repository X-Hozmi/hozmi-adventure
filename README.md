
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for both wonder and peril.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey, but the unwavering hope for her brother fuels her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, her course charted for the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby as they navigate the treacherous nebulae and wormholes.  Unlike Elara's journey across a single world, Ryla's expedition spans unimaginable distances, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  The challenges are different – navigating gravitational anomalies, repairing damaged warp cores, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms – but the spirit of adventure, the thirst for discovery, burns just as brightly within her as it did in the heart of the medieval traveler.
