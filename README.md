
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat and a chipped map, guiding her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and wonder.  Bandit patrols, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine tested her spirit and resolve, yet the whispered tales of Ys's untold riches – and the legendary sword hidden within its walls – spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony were mere inconveniences compared to the unknown challenges awaiting them on the planet's surface. The allure of discovery, the potential for groundbreaking scientific breakthroughs, and the sheer audacity of interstellar exploration propelled her and her crew across the vast expanse of the cosmos, defying the perils of deep space.
