
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a map, brittle with age, charting a perilous path to the mythical city of Zerzura.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the challenges she faced, but the whispered legends of Zerzura's unimaginable riches and lost knowledge fueled her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a chapter in her unfolding adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Navigating through treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace; the real adventure lay in exploring uncharted planets teeming with bizarre alien life.  The thrill of discovery – of encountering sentient fungi on Xylos, or excavating ancient ruins on Kepler-186f – overshadowed the inherent risks of deep space travel.  For Ryla, the universe was not just a place to travel through, but a boundless canvas for exploration and wonder.
