
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical city of Ys, a quest fuelled by both greed and a desperate hope for a cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the chilling threat of bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature; yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to glimpse the legendary city shimmering in a hidden valley, spurred her onwards. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of discovery, or doom.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The journey, a tapestry of warped spacetime and alien encounters, tested her courage and skill to their limits. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a thrilling plunge into the unknown expanse of the cosmos; the rewards, however, could rewrite the future of humanity, a future worth risking everything to secure.
