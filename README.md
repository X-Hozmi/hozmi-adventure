
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants and pilgrims, snaked across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague stalked them like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – scorching deserts, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Samarkand, with its whispered riches and legendary silks, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hypersleep punctuated by the occasional jolt of unexpected asteroid fields and the chilling silence of empty space.   Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and secure a vital resource needed for the survival of her people.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a challenge far different from Elara's, but the spirit of adventure, the yearning for the unknown, burned equally bright in both women's hearts.
