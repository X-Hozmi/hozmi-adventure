
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the unrest in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing fear of bandits, the looming threat of disease, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road. Yet, with every creaking wagon wheel and braying donkey, our journey westward unfolds, a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the tantalizing promise of untold riches and adventure in the fabled city of Constantinople.

Conversely, in 2742, the stars are our highway.  The gargantuan 'Starseeker' leaps across the void, a silver needle piercing the velvet tapestry of space.  We, a team of xeno-archaeologists, are bound for Xylos, a planet light-years distant, rumored to hold the secrets of a long-vanished interstellar civilization.  The thrill of discovery is matched only by the chilling possibility of encountering unknown, and perhaps hostile, life forms amidst the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the eerie silence of deep space.  Our journey transcends mere travel; it’s a quest to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.
