Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried rations; it contained the whispered hopes of her village, a desperate plea for healing herbs rumored to grow only in the secluded monastery nestled beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the long grass, held the promise of adventure, and the chilling possibility of bandit encounters or perilous mountain paths.  Her journey was a gamble, but the stakes were life itself.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable emptiness of space.  Ahead lay the possibility of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories among the stars, but also the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the unknown dangers lurking in the unexplored corners of the galaxy.  The adventure was immense, the risk even greater, but the lure of discovery burned bright within her.
