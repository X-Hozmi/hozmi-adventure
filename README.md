
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like the teeth of some monstrous beast.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, is her only guide through this unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the thrill of the unknown.  She travels not for glory, but for survival, seeking a legendary healer in a faraway valley, her ailing brother's only hope.  The journey is fraught with peril: bandits, blizzards, and the constant gnawing fear of the wilderness itself.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, promising untold riches and the chance to escape the overcrowding of Earth's successor cities.  The journey is measured in light-years, a slow, deliberate crawl across the gulf of space.  Yet, the thrill is the same – the unknown, the possibility of discovery, and the constant hum of danger lurking just beyond the shimmering shields, be it a rogue asteroid or a hostile alien intelligence.
