
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a failing harvest and a vengeful Baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and discovery.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were her constant companions on this arduous journey across the known world, a pilgrimage fueled by resilience and a yearning for a better future.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort, contrasting sharply with the breathtaking, alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport.  Her mission was a scientific one, but the vastness of space, the potential for unknown encounters, and the sheer audacity of interstellar travel ignited an adventurous spirit mirroring that of her medieval ancestor, a thrill of exploration against the backdrop of infinite possibility.
