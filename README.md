
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her sweat-soaked skin.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, burned in her saddlebag – a mission fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of plague haunted every crumbling village.  Each sunrise brought the chilling possibility of ambush, starvation, or the insidious touch of disease; yet, with each mile closer to her destination, Elara's resolve hardened. The fate of countless souls rested on her weary shoulders and the strength of her loyal beast.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of his navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant K'tharr system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of space pirates, treacherous gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the uncharted void.  The galaxy was vast, unforgiving, and full of riches for those brave – or foolish – enough to seek them.
