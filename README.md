
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the unpredictable weather could easily turn a day's travel into a death sentence.  Yet, the lure of the exotic East, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and vibrant cultures, spurred him onward, a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a new challenge to overcome, a constant reminder of the vastness of the land and the fragility of life.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less perilous.  Uncharted asteroid fields threatened to shatter her ship, cosmic radiation posed a constant threat to the crew, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on them, a stark reminder of their isolation.  But the promise of new worlds, of alien civilizations and unfathomable discoveries, fueled their daring expedition, a testament to humanity's boundless thirst for exploration, even across the unimaginable distances of the galaxy.
