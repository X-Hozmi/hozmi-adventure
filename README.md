
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance like a mirage.  Her journey had been arduous; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested her resolve.  Yet, the promise of finding her estranged brother, rumored to be a knight in the service of the Pope, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought the hope of a new encounter, a fresh clue, a closer step towards reunion.  The vastness of the medieval world, both beautiful and brutal, was her canvas, and her journey, a testament to human resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of his ship.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble, but the allure of the unknown, the vastness of space offering untold riches and unimaginable dangers, was a siren song he couldn't resist.  His journey, a testament to humanity's relentless push to explore the cosmos.
