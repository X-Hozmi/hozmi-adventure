
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each rocky step was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed passes, and the biting wind threatened frostbite.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her people spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, brutal beauty of the medieval landscape.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward, life itself, made every hardship worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Raxon piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be teeming with both unimaginable riches and deadly, unknown creatures.  Warp speed was their only hope against the vast distances between galaxies, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  The risks were astronomical – spatial anomalies, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of system collapse – but the promise of galactic peace, and a hefty bounty, outweighed the fear. The cosmos was a dangerous playground, but Razor was ready to play.
