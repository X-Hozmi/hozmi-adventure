
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of fiery orange and deep violet.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send her tumbling into the abyss, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every mile conquered, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any star.  The promise of riches and discovery spurred her through the exhaustion and fear, each sunrise a new chapter in her epic adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and vibrant gas clouds.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in conventional travel.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held dangers far beyond any medieval bandit.  Unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept the crew on edge.  But the allure of the unknown, the potential for discovery in uncharted territories, propelled them forward, their hearts filled with the same adventurous spirit that had driven Elara across the medieval landscape.
