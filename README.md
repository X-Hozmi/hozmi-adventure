
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and distant woods clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried rations and a well-thumbed map, its edges frayed from countless consultations.  Each rise revealed a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis promised beyond the endless desert, fueled her onward.  The journey was arduous, but the possibility of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her relentless pace.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't measured in days or weeks, but in subjective time, stretched and compressed by the warp drive's unpredictable currents. The crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and terraformers, faced the constant threat of spatial anomalies and hostile alien lifeforms.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to build a future among the stars, outweighed the risks inherent in interstellar travel.  The vast emptiness of space held both terror and incredible beauty, a constant reminder of the boundless adventure awaiting them.
