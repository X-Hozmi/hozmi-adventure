
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred by rumors of a mythical city of gold, trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Our horses, once spirited steeds, were now shadows of their former selves, their hooves sinking into the parched earth with each labored step. Yet, the glint of gold, however faint, fueled our determination, pushing us onward across treacherous mountain passes and raging rivers, toward a destiny uncertain but undeniably alluring.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Stardust Drifter* sliced through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson glow of its red dwarf sun.  Captain Elara, her eyes fixed on the holographic navigation chart, navigated asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational currents, while her crew prepared for the long months of hypersleep needed for the journey.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, but the promise of new worlds, new life, and the thrill of exploration eclipsed any fear.
