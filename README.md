
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village he'd left behind.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold a cure.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each flash of distant lightning, each rustle in the shadowed forest, represented both peril and hope in his arduous journey across the fractured landscape of a war-torn kingdom.  He carried not only his meager possessions, but the weight of his people's fate.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from her home in the Sol system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent, star-dusted vastness surrounding her.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, displaying the intricate web of wormholes and interstellar lanes.  Her mission: to establish contact with a rumored alien civilization and secure vital resources for a dwindling Earth.   The dangers were alien, the distances unimaginable, yet Eva pressed forward, driven by a thirst for discovery and the fate of humanity itself.
