
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan’s worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the bleak landscape in shades of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the chilling grip of the sickness itself.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward across the unforgiving terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in lightyears.  The vast emptiness between planets held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of finding her lost kin, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
