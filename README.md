
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurked in every shadowed wood, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air. Each day brought new challenges: fording raging rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meagre sustenance in squalid villages.  Yet, the allure of the sacred city, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the thrill of the unknown spurred them onward, their medieval world a vast and unpredictable landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy.  Warp jumps across light-years of space were routine, but navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates were constant threats. Each planet offered a unique and breathtaking challenge, from toxic jungles teeming with alien life to desolate ice worlds where survival depended on advanced technology and quick thinking.  The galaxy was her playground, a boundless expanse of wonder and danger, a testament to humanity's relentless quest for the unknown.
