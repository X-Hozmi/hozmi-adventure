
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We’ve braved bandit ambushes, forded raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated treacherous mountain passes. Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – the lurking threat of disease, the ever-present possibility of starvation, and the constant fear of encountering the brutal warlords that hold sway over this fractured land.  Our destination, the legendary city of Samarkand, feels as distant and ethereal as a mirage.


Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of space.  We chart unknown nebulae, brave asteroid fields teeming with deadly space rocks, and navigate treacherous wormholes, each jump a gamble against the unforgiving nature of the cosmos. The lure of new worlds, teeming with alien life and untold riches, keeps us pushing ever onward, despite the ever-present threat of pirate attacks, engine failures, and the creeping loneliness of interstellar travel.  The universe is vast, and our journey has just begun.
