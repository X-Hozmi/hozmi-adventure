
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's writ, a crumpled scroll clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches and glory in the far-off Sultanate of Damascus – riches to pay his father's debts, glory to erase the stain of his family's disgraced name.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered of bandits, of starvation, and of the countless perils that lay between him and his desperate hope.  He was alone, save for the loyal but equally exhausted beast beneath him, facing a journey as unforgiving as the land itself.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from her home in the Sol system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion to the loneliness of interstellar travel, a stark contrast to the vibrant data streams painting the cosmos on her viewscreen.  Ahead lay the unknown, the potential for discovery and catastrophe intertwined. The weight of her mission, the hope of humankind riding on her shoulders, felt as heavy as the gravity of a dying star.
