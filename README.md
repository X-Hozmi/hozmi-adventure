
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains of France as Sir Reginald and his retinue pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Their horses, weary and thin, stumbled through mud and snow, their riders fueled by hope and a desperate need to survive.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of Eldoria, a beacon of salvation in a dying world, kept their spirits alight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a civilization potentially holding the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos was both terrifying and exhilarating, a stark contrast to the familiar, yet still perilous, landscapes of their ancestors, yet the thrill of discovery was a constant companion.
