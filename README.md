
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary mount onward. The trail, barely more than a deer path, snaked through the dense Black Forest, shadows lengthening as twilight approached.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a jolt of fear through him, the whispers of bandits and wild beasts a constant companion on his journey to the Holy Land.  He carried a king's ransom in gold, and a king's burden of responsibility, for this pilgrimage held the fate of his family in its balance.  Every creak of saddle leather, every drop of sweat, was a testament to the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort, a stark contrast to the alien beauty unfolding outside her viewport – swirling colors and celestial bodies unseen by human eyes until now. This wasn't just exploration; it was the desperate search for a new home, a gamble against the dying embers of Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying uncertainty, a far cry from the shadowed forests of Reginald's age.
