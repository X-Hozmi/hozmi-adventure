Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous bogs, looming bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

The whispers of its power, and the glory awaiting its discoverer, were a constant companion to the gnawing hunger and the ache in his bones.

Xylo, pilot of the 'Stardust Drifter', navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos system.  Her ship, a marvel of bio-engineered technology, hummed with the energy of a thousand suns as it leaped between star systems.

Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp storm decades ago.  The fate of billions hung in the balance, a weight she carried with every pulse of the hyperdrive.
