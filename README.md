
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the whispered promise of Jerusalem's sacred stones, the thrill of navigating unknown landscapes, and the camaraderie forged with fellow pilgrims fuelled her onward, a tiny figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the ship and the distant glitter of galaxies, was a different kind of peril.  The dangers were alien and unknowable - rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of discovery, the hope of a unified future, and the uncharted territory ahead spurred him on, a lone explorer in the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
