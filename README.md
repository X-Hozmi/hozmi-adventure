
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the promised bounty of the Sultan's court.  His quest, a perilous journey across half a continent, was fraught with dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, but also the chilling awareness of how easily his ambition could end beneath a bandit's blade or beneath the unforgiving sky.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  The vibrant colours of nebulous clouds painted a breathtaking backdrop to the perilous journey between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but navigating asteroid fields and encountering unknown spacefaring species were constant hazards.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, a gamble against the unknown that mirrored the medieval knight's perilous land journey, only with stars instead of forests.
