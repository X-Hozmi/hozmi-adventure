
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving far more treacherous than the whispered tales had suggested. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, with each sunrise, Elara found a renewed sense of purpose, driven by faith and the whispered promise of a miraculous cure at the journey's end. The journey tested her strength, her spirit, and her resilience, forging her into something stronger than she'd ever imagined.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing critical systems under the gaze of alien constellations was all in a day’s work for Eva and her crew. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, but also the ever-present danger of the unknown.  Every jump across hyperspace was a gamble, every encounter with the bizarre inhabitants of the galaxy a potential turning point in the grand human saga of interstellar exploration.
