
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, a journey fraught with peril but fueled by unwavering sibling love.  The sun beat down mercilessly, the path ahead a seemingly endless ribbon of rock and scrub, yet the glint of distant snow-capped peaks offered a flicker of hope amidst the hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were just another Tuesday for Ryla, though the thrill of charting unexplored galaxies never faded.  Her current mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the edge of known space, a whisper of civilization clinging to the fringes of the vast, unknown cosmos.  The hum of the hyperdrive and the breathtaking panorama of alien constellations spurred her onward, the ultimate adventure a siren song echoing across the light years.
