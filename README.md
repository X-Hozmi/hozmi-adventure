
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each crest offered breathtaking vistas, yet held the potential for ambush; bandits and wild animals were equal threats.  My meager possessions – a map older than myself, a worn sword, and a dwindling supply of dried meat – were all that stood between me and the unforgiving wilderness.  The promised riches of the East, however fantastical they seemed, fueled my relentless journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  The starfield outside my viewport shifted from a swirling chaos of light to the serene glow of Xylos' twin suns.  This wasn't a quest for gold, but for knowledge – the secrets hidden within Xylos' ancient ruins.  The dangers were different here: hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of system malfunction. But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, surpassed every risk.
