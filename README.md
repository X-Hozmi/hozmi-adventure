
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue plodded across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had become a desperate scramble for survival.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed wood, supplies dwindled with each passing day, and the relentless sun beat down on their weary bodies.  Yet, the promise of the Apostle's shrine, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, each creak of their worn saddles a testament to their shared adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory void-ships of the Kryll, Elara and her crew faced perils far removed from medieval hardship, but no less deadly.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering cosmic dust and vibrant nebulas, held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, making every jump through hyperspace a gamble in their grand, interstellar adventure.
