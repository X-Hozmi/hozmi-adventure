
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, the scent of pine and damp earth a poor substitute for the familiar smell of her village.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and the map – a crude, hand-drawn thing – guiding her to the legendary city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the ever-present threat of violence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the vast expanse of the cosmos a stark contrast to the terrestrial struggles of her ancestors. Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hummed with controlled chaos as she charted a course between galaxies, battling gravitational anomalies and navigating treacherous asteroid fields. The thrill was not of survival against bandits and storms, but against the incomprehensible vastness of space itself, the lure of discovery a potent force outweighing the potential for catastrophic failure.
