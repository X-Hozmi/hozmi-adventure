
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Shrine of Saint Alora, led them across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, bandit-infested forests, and across rivers swollen with spring melt. Each day brought new challenges –  dodging marauders, negotiating with suspicious villagers, and battling the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Their quest was not just for religious salvation, but also for the legendary healing balm said to be guarded within the shrine.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere, a megastructure capable of harnessing the energy of an entire star, and potentially holding the key to solving the galactic energy crisis.  Warp jumps between star systems were perilous, fraught with the risk of encountering space anomalies and hostile alien civilizations.  But the lure of discovery, and the potential for a breakthrough that could save countless lives, fueled Eva's unwavering resolve.  The vast expanse of space held both unimaginable beauty and unimaginable dangers.
