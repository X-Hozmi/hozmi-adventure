
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for both peril and wonder.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the promise of reaching the fabled city of Alexandria, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled her relentless journey.  The road was long and arduous, a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the Kepler-186f system.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting drone against the vast, inky blackness of space.  Alien landscapes, uncharted planets, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile lifeforms were far more technologically challenging obstacles than any medieval traveler faced, but the same spirit of intrepid exploration burned within her, a legacy passed down through generations, from the dusty tracks of Aquitaine to the star-dusted highways of the cosmos.
