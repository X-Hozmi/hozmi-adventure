
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed onward.  My journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease dogged my steps.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching my destination, but every sunset brought the grim reality of surviving another night under the unforgiving gaze of the medieval sky.  Each village offered a fleeting respite, a chance to share stories and bread with weary souls on their own paths.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, a deep thrum that vibrated through my very bones.  Instead of bandits, I navigated asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies. Instead of disease, the threat of hull breaches and hostile alien encounters loomed.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years away.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown.  But unlike the medieval pilgrims, I had the technology – and the knowledge – to chart a course across the vastness of space, towards a new frontier and a future yet unwritten.
