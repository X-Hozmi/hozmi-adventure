
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a priceless map promising the location of a lost monastery, rumored to house ancient healing secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the Inquisition, always vigilant for those who dared stray from the Church's doctrine.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate hope balanced precariously against the harsh realities of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, its fate unknown for decades.  Navigating asteroid fields and contending with unpredictable wormhole jumps, Eva and her crew faced perils far removed from earthly concerns.  Alien life, hostile space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system failure were her constant companions. The vastness of space, though beautiful, was a cold and unforgiving wilderness, demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering belief in the possibility of survival.
