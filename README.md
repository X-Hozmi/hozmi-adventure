
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's retinue as they traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of their saddle leather, each rustle of the wind through their worn surcoats, spoke of the miles already conquered and the perilous journey yet to come.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked them in the sun-baked fields, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of El Dorado, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon of their ambition, fueled their weary steps onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reminder of the immense power harnessed, and the equally immense dangers encountered in traversing the vast expanse of space.  Asteroid fields, rogue plasma bursts, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested her skill and courage, but the promise of unlocking the galaxy's secrets pushed her, and her crew, ever closer to their destination.
