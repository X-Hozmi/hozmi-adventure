
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks a stark contrast to the sapphire sky.  Her worn map, more a collection of faded scribbles than a precise guide, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Rumors of a lost city, glittering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her journey, a desperate gamble against the looming shadow of famine in her village.  Every creak of the mule's harness, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy bursts from dying stars, was a daily challenge.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes.  The thrill of discovery, however, burned brighter than any earthly sun.
