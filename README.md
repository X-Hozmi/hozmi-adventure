
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, a far cry from the familiar fields of my English village.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar spices hung heavy in the air as I joined a caravan heading east, towards the legendary silk roads.  Each sunrise brought a new vista – the snow-capped Alps, the sun-baked plains of Hungary, the bustling bazaars of Constantinople.  Danger lurked at every turn: bandits, disease, the ever-present threat of starvation. But the allure of the unknown, the promise of unimaginable riches and exotic cultures, pushed me onward.  

Centuries later, my descendant piloting the starship *Odyssey* barely registers the jump to warp speed.  The cosmos unfurls outside, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant galaxies. Our mission: to locate a habitable planet in the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia for slower ships but compressed into weeks thanks to our advanced technology. The vast emptiness is punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the occasional crackle of communications. Yet, despite the technological marvels at our fingertips, a sense of isolation—a kinship with those medieval travelers—persists. The vastness of space, like the vastness of the medieval world, evokes both exhilarating freedom and a profound, humbling loneliness.
