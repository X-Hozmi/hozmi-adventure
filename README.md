
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges they faced. Yet, the whispered legends of the saint’s miraculous power fueled their resolve, pushing them further across the unforgiving landscape, their hope a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey fraught with dangers unseen.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the chilling loneliness of interstellar travel were constant companions.  But the thought of reuniting with the lost colonists, of discovering new life and uncharted worlds, spurred her on, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a testament to human courage and the endless quest for discovery.
