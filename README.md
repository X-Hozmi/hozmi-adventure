
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  The scent of woodsmoke and sweat mingled with the sharper tang of fear; rumors of bandits plagued the King's Road, and her meager caravan was a tempting target.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her. This journey to the distant city of Aloria, to deliver her father's precious scrolls, was a perilous gamble, a test of endurance and courage that could mean riches... or ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of cosmic wonder, yet the mission was anything but idyllic.  Her crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, were on a desperate quest for the mythical Xylos crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with danger – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning hyperdrives – but the potential reward, a revolution in interstellar travel, was too enticing to resist.
