
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her brother's whispered pleas for help, bounced against her back.  Each sunrise brought the promise of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing fear of never reaching the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for his plague.  Yet, with every creak of her saddle and clang of her meager possessions, her resolve hardened – this adventure, perilous as it was, held the only hope for her family.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years away,  a perilous journey through asteroid fields and unknown spatial anomalies.  The thrill of exploration, the daunting challenges of interstellar travel – these were the spices of his life, a far cry from the mundane tasks of galactic supply runs.  The universe, vast and indifferent, held both unimaginable beauty and deadly peril, but Rexx craved it all.
