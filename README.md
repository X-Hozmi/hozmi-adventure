
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the trials she faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unknown dangers that lurked around every bend in the dusty track.  Each day brought a fresh wave of hardship, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and deciphering ancient alien signals, Ryla and her crew battled not only the vastness of space, but also the dwindling hope of finding survivors. The journey tested their courage and their technology, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the uncharted and potentially deadly expanse of the cosmos.
