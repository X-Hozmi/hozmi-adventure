
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the hope of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in his mind, spurred him on, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and perhaps, salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships tested her skills and the ship's resilience to the limits.  The vastness of space held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the thought of reuniting with the colonists, and unraveling the mystery of their disappearance, fueled her determination to push ever further into the uncharted cosmos.
