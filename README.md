
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust devils in the fading light.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the sense of peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in their folklore. Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, breathtaking landscapes, and fleeting moments of camaraderie forged in the crucible of shared adversity.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were daily occurrences, the vastness of space a constant reminder of their isolation.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, felt a thrill of the unknown, a kinship with the pioneers who had charted the cosmos before her.  The galaxy was her canvas, and every jump to hyperspace a brushstroke toward a future yet unwritten.
