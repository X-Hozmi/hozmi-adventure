
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both breathtaking beauty and deadly peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked her every step.  The journey was arduous, but the lure of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and alien encounters – though rare – potentially devastating.  Yet, the vastness of space, the shimmering beauty of nebulas, and the possibility of discovering new life spurred her on, a modern-day explorer navigating a cosmos far more alien than any medieval landscape.
