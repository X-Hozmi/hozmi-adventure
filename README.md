
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious heirloom varieties she was smuggling across enemy lines to a besieged monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down her spine, a reminder of the bandits and soldiers who lurked between her and her destination.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of preserving her heritage fueled her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a mythical nebula rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes they had to traverse – portals that could lead to anywhere, or nowhere at all.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking wonder and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the perilous, yet exhilarating, nature of galactic exploration.
