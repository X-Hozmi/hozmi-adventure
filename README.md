
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the whispered promises of healing spurred her on, transforming the harsh landscape into a tapestry of adventure woven with hope and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours swirling around her vessel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic hyperspace jump.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were mere inconveniences compared to the existential dread of traversing the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  But the faint signal, a whisper from a forgotten world, kept her engines roaring and her heart ablaze with the relentless pursuit of discovery.
