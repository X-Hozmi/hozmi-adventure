
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the legendary Shrine of Aethelred, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits had waylaid them in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their endurance, and the endless expanse of the steppe had threatened to consume them entirely. Yet, the whispered promise of healing and the unwavering hope in his heart drove him further, each sunrise painting a new chapter in his perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the routine.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, presented challenges that dwarfed any earthly peril.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for contact with the unknown, fueled her spirit, making the risks worthwhile in the pursuit of her galactic adventure.
