
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable terrain itself all threatened to thwart her journey. Yet, the thought of her brother spurred her on, fueling her resolve to brave the unknown and reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: a survey of unexplored planetary systems, searching for habitable worlds. The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the potential for discovery balanced by the ever-present threat of nebulae storms and uncharted gravitational anomalies.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the infinite, fueled by the human spirit's endless curiosity and the insatiable desire to chart the cosmos.
