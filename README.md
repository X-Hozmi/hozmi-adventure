
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, a barely-there track through the Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless rain.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a destination worth braving brigands, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of perilous adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, though far faster than any medieval trek, held its own brand of danger.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms made each hyperspace jump a gamble.  Yet, the lure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories and encountering the unknown, propelled her forward, the vast expanse of space mirroring the boundless spirit of human exploration.
