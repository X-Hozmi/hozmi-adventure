
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King: a plea for aid against the encroaching horde.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush, for the unforeseen dangers that lurked in every shadow of this unforgiving landscape. Survival, not speed, was her only concern on this perilous journey across the splintered kingdom.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her bio-engineered eyes scanning for pirate vessels.  This wasn't a quest for gold or a king's mercy, but for the elusive Xylos crystals, powerful energy sources vital for interstellar travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes,  Rexx faced dangers far more exotic than any medieval bandit:  quantum storms, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of rival corporations.  The galaxy was her kingdom, and the stakes were far higher than any earthly war.
