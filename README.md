
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his squire Thomas, and their three packhorses, laden with meager supplies and boundless ambition, crested the windswept hill.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of green fields and dark forests whispering tales of brigands and forgotten magic. Their quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the lost chronicle of King Arthur.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Their journey was a tapestry woven from hardship and wonder, from the camaraderie of shared dangers to the breathtaking beauty of a world largely untouched by the encroaching shadow of the Black Death.

Centuries hence, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble freighter capable of traversing the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission, far from medieval quests, was the acquisition of Xylos, a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on her drought-stricken homeworld.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Elara’s journey was a constant test of skill and courage.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both the promise of unimaginable riches and the certain threat of oblivion.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
