
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a warning of impending plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie forged with weary travelers met along the way, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, a constant companion on her perilous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, was equally terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and battling the occasional pirate crew were all part of a spacefarer's life.  The thrill of discovery, the potential for new life, fueled her onward, despite the ever-present risk of catastrophic system failure amidst the cold, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
