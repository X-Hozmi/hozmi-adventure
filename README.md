
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant war hung heavy in the air.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek an audience with the Pope himself, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the very rivers held the threat of disease. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, a stark contrast to the mundane life she’d left behind.  Survival itself was a constant, thrilling test.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from her home planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and repairing damaged warp engines were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the vibrant colours of celestial bodies and the alien landscapes of unexplored planets, offered a different kind of adventure – a thrilling exploration of the unknown, a frontier where the only limits were the boundaries of imagination and the resilience of her ship.
