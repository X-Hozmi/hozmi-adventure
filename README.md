
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a prayer against bandits and the ever-present chill of the autumn wind.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, had sent me across the treacherous landscapes of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista: rolling hills giving way to dark, brooding forests, then vast plains under a sky perpetually bruised with storm clouds.  My meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, but the weight of my responsibility, the hope of the besieged, fueled my weary legs.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant colour as we leaped across the unimaginable distances separating us from Xylos.  My mission, far from a King's desperate plea, was to establish diplomatic relations with a newly discovered sentient species.  The risks were different— not bandits and starvation, but the unknown, the potential hostility of a civilization vastly different from our own.  Yet, the thrill, the sense of exploration echoing the medieval pilgrims' journeys, was precisely the same.  The vastness of space, like the endless expanse of the medieval world, held a seductive promise of discovery and wonder.
