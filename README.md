
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack mules and weary men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance in the shimmering heat, mirroring the turmoil in my own heart.  Each sunrise brings the chilling promise of bandits, and each sunset, the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of the Silk Road's untold riches, the thrill of charting unknown territories, and the yearning for something beyond our humble village spur us onward, towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  The journey is perilous, but the lure of the unknown eclipses all fear.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we traverse the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and our own.  Captain Eva Rostova’s weathered face reflects the countless nebulae we’ve navigated, each a breathtaking masterpiece of cosmic dust and stellar fire. The mission: to chart the unexplored regions of Andromeda, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival on a dying Earth. The dangers are different now—unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure—but the adventurous spirit remains, burning bright in the heart of every crew member, a beacon in the inky blackness of space.
