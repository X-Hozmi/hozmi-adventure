
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary in the rumored haven of Avignon.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rocky ford, was a gamble against bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of the plague.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of beauty – the breathtaking sweep of the Alps, the kindness of a weary farmer offering bread and water, the chilling whispers of ancient ruins hinting at forgotten empires.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky blackness held both wonder and peril.  Navigation charts were only estimates, unpredictable solar flares threatened to fry the ship's systems, and the possibility of encountering unknown sentient lifeforms loomed large. Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her relentless pursuit, a modern-day odyssey driven by courage and the insatiable human thirst for exploration.
