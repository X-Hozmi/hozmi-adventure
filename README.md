
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of France, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael from the clutches of a heretical sect rumored to dwell in the shadowed mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and untold riches, a potent brew fueling his relentless journey across a land teeming with both beauty and brutality.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering faintly across the light-years.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of stars and alien planets, held a different kind of terror than Sir Reginald's journey.  Here, the perils were not brigands and wild beasts, but cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of uncharted dangers lurking in the inky black between worlds. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unknown wonders, propelled her ever forward.
