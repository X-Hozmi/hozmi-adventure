
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection against the scorching heat, but the thrill of her journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela – fueled her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the dry grasses, held a whisper of adventure; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and whispered legends of mythical creatures haunted the lonely stretches of road.  Her only companions were her loyal mule, a well-worn map, and the unwavering hope that lay at the end of her arduous path.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been treacherous, pushing the ship’s engines to their absolute limit.  But the promise of discovering a new, habitable world – a paradise untouched by human greed – outweighed the risks.  The vast, inky blackness offered a thrilling loneliness, broken only by the distant shimmer of alien stars and the hum of the ship's life support. Each jump was a gamble, each new system a chance encounter with the unknown wonders and terrifying dangers of the cosmos.
