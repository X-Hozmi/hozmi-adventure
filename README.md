The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous – towering castles perched on distant crags, whispering forests promising ambush, and rivers swollen with the meltwater of spring.

Advanced technology mitigated some dangers, but the vastness of space and unpredictable nature of cosmic events ensured that every warp jump was a gamble, every encounter a potential turning point in her perilous adventure.
