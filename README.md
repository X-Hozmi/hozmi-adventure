
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of legend, fueled their weary steps, promising glory and untold riches to those brave enough to seek it.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a familiar thrill.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy had been risky, a gamble to reach the rumored Xylossian artifact, a device capable of manipulating spacetime itself. Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate patrols was routine; the real danger lay in the unknown physics of the Xylossian system.  Each warp jump was a leap of faith, a dance with the potential for annihilation, but the promise of discovery burned brighter than any fear.
