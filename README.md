
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald’s retinue trudged across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of a treacherous Baron.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings swollen by relentless rain, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to break their resolve.  Yet, the glint of the distant mountains, the promise of sanctuary and the sacred relic fueled their weary steps towards an unknown destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish first contact with the enigmatic Zydonian civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors - unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of the unknown, the potential for discovery and the chance to reshape galactic relations, pushed Eva and her crew ever onward across the cosmic expanse.
