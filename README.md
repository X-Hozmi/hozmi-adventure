
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange. His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were all obstacles in his path, yet the lure of Eldoria and the hope it represented spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to possess the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Yet, the allure of unlocking the universe's secrets, of bridging the vast distances between worlds, fueled her relentless journey among the stars.
