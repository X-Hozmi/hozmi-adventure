
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds all she owns: a few coins, dried meats, a worn map barely legible in the fading light, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zaragoza before winter's icy grip claims her.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this perilous journey, but the lure of a new life, whispered in the tales of her grandmother, drives her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, jumps to hyperspace, the swirling nebulae a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a burgeoning human colony.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the unpredictable whims of the void – the spirit of adventure remains the same: a relentless curiosity pushing against the boundaries of the known, fueled by a thirst for discovery and the unwavering belief in the possibilities that lie beyond the stars.
