
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse brush, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the relentless sun threatened as much as any human foe.  Yet, with every mile, the legendary city drew closer, fueling her determination amidst the hardships of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Khel steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aerilon, flung across the Andromeda galaxy centuries ago.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the vast emptiness between stars held its own dangers.  Nebulae threatened to tear apart the ship's hull, and unseen celestial bodies lurked in the dark, ready to crush the fragile vessel.  Yet, the promise of finding a lost civilization, the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, pushed her onwards, a modern adventurer braving the cosmic frontier.
