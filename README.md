
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance at the darkening horizon, represented a hurdle in her perilous journey.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation all stood between her and her goal, a testament to the brutal beauty and uncertain rewards of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets amidst the swirling cosmic dust.  Unlike the limitations of medieval travel, Ryla's journey was constrained only by the speed of light and the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and alien encounters – the thrill of the unknown, the push towards the unexplored, echoed the spirit of Elara's medieval adventure across a vastly different, yet equally unforgiving, landscape.
