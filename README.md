
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's retinue as they traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Shrine of Saint Elara, had already claimed two horses and tested their resolve against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for scarce provisions, and facing the constant unease of the unknown wilderness.  Their quest, fuelled by faith and a desperate hope for healing, was a testament to the human spirit’s enduring capacity for adventure.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming algae to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating hyperspace was a dance with unpredictable gravitational forces and the ever-present danger of pirate incursions.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and lurking threats, demanded both precision and courage.  Eva, a seasoned explorer, held her course, her heart pounding with the thrill of discovery and the weight of responsibility for the colony's survival.
