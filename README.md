
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the next hill, the rugged Pyrenees mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not just meager supplies, but also a king's ransom in the form of a smuggled gemstone – a perilous cargo that fuels her journey.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions, yet the lure of the faraway city of Constantinople, and the promise of a new life, drive her onward through the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immense backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the drought-stricken planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home.  Asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids are commonplace hazards, demanding constant vigilance and quick thinking. But the promise of saving a dying world, and the thrill of charting the uncharted, fuel her journey across the galaxy, one warp jump at a time.
