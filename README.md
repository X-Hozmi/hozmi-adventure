
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zamora, rumored to hold the lost scroll of Saint Ildica, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and her mount's endurance, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the promise of discovery spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  The journey to the Kepler-186f system, a fledgling colony on a potentially habitable planet, was measured not in days, but in light-years.  Warp drives hummed, artificial gravity strained against the pull of distant suns, and the ever-present threat of space pirates hung like a shroud.  But the allure of a new world, a new beginning, far outweighed the dangers, driving Rexa and her crew across the immeasurable expanse of the galaxy.
