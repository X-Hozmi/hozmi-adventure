
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and bread; it contained the King's missive, a perilous journey to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the disease itself stalked the land, a far greater threat than any human enemy.  She pressed on, driven by duty and a desperate hope for her plague-stricken village.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor"  Valoria piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches in rare minerals, but also rumored to be guarded by hostile Xylarathians.  The jump to hyperspace was a blur of starlight, followed by the painstaking process of navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate patrols.  The vastness of space was both exhilarating and terrifying; a single miscalculation could mean the end of the mission, and possibly, the end of her life.
