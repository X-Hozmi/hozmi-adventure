
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's band of knights crested the hill, their battered armor glinting weakly in the harsh sun.  Before them stretched the seemingly endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry woven with whispering forests, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, demanded fortitude against both the elements and the lurking dangers of a world where civilization ended abruptly at the edge of each lord's domain. Every ford was a gamble, every village a potential haven or snare.  Their journey was not merely geographical; it was a test of their faith, their loyalty, and their very survival.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and warping through space-time was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure funding and resources for the mission.   The vastness of space held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns.   Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving nature of the cosmos,  a test of the crew's skill and the ship's resilience.  Their adventure wasn't about conquering a kingdom, but exploring the boundless frontiers of the galaxy and discovering the secrets of life beyond Earth.
