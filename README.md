Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of Provence, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards he'd left behind.  His quest – to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland – felt both impossibly distant and desperately urgent. Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his weary horse, echoed the perilous journey ahead, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of disease.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a hypnotic counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of uncharted space. While robotic scans provided data, the thrill of discovery remained intensely personal, a legacy of the pioneering spirit that had pushed humanity beyond the confines of its solar system into the boundless, beautiful, and undeniably dangerous expanse of the galaxy.
