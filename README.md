
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the skeletal remains of a long-dead forest stretching towards a horizon choked by swirling sand.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope, as bright as the distant mirage, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, far removed from the mundane dangers of medieval travel.  Her mission, however, held a similar weight: to find a new habitable world for the dying population of Xylos, a planet ravaged by a catastrophic solar flare.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, presented its own unique brand of peril, a constant battle against the unforgiving realities of the cosmos.
