
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood – a grim reminder of the bandit ambush a day past.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests haunted by rumour and superstition, and across sun-baked plains where the only company was the relentless sun and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the wrath of Xylos's unpredictable space currents was child's play compared to the potential dangers lurking within the derelict station - rogue AI, mutated lifeforms, or perhaps something far more sinister.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, felt isolating, the weight of her responsibility a constant companion in the echoing silence of the void.
