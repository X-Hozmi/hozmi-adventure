
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Iberian Peninsula.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered rumors of a lost city, brimming with ancient magic, fueled her journey.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and grime, was her only guide across the vast, unknown expanse of land separating her from her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console.  Faster-than-light travel had made the galaxy accessible, but the vastness of space still held its terrors: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to locate a legendary artifact hidden on a remote planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace. The journey across the cosmos, while technologically advanced, demanded the same courage and resilience as any medieval quest.
