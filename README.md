
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Calais, a journey fraught with peril from brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for life or death.  He pressed on, driven by duty and the hope of a safe return to his family.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  Each star she passed, each alien landscape glimpsed through her viewport, was a testament to the vast, unexplored universe and the audacious spirit of humanity that dared to traverse its uncharted reaches.  The thrill of discovery burned brighter than any star.
