
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous passes tested their mounts, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and endurance, forging a bond stronger than any oath.  The whispers of the mountains themselves seemed to beckon them forward, promising both salvation and oblivion in equal measure.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the encroaching void centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Warp jumps threatened to tear their ship apart, alien lifeforms lurked in the inky black, and the ever-present loneliness of deep space weighed heavily on their spirits. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories, fueled their relentless pursuit across the galaxy.
