
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed several pack animals and tested the limits of their endurance.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the shifting landscape – dense forests giving way to barren mountains, the occasional friendly village a fleeting respite from the ever-present threat of bandits and the unforgiving elements.  Each sunrise brought the hope of Eldoria closer, a beacon in the vast, unknown expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the galaxy was a symphony of starlight and calculated risks, navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory patrols of the Kryll Hegemony.  The vastness of space was a daunting but exhilarating challenge, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown, propelled by the relentless pursuit of a future beyond the stars.
