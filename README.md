
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Ardennes forest, wound ever deeper, promising both peril and the legendary lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of untold riches and ancient secrets whispered on the wind. Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a pulse of excitement, a reminder of the vast unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing warp core breaches were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of swirling colours and celestial wonders, both thrilled and humbled her.  The promise of new life, new discoveries, and the sheer audacity of interstellar travel fueled her onward, a modern-day knight errant charting the cosmos.
