
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach Avignon, bearing a vital message that could sway the course of a brewing war.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the dangers that lay ahead.  The weight of responsibility – and the hope of a safe arrival – fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien species formed the fabric of her voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even her most ambitious dreams, yet the promise of discovery burned brighter than any star.
