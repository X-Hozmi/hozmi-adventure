
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the plague that stalked the land.  Her journey was a constant gamble against the elements, disease, and the ever-present threat of human cruelty, yet the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its multi-hued gases a breathtaking but treacherous backdrop to their interstellar voyage.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and erratic their only guide.  Warp drives hummed, battling against gravitational tides and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown space anomalies.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held them captive, the fate of the colonists – and their own – hanging precariously in the balance.
