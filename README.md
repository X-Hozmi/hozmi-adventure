
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn map clutched tight.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, fueled her onward, a lone adventurer against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos system, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across light years, through asteroid fields and treacherous wormholes, Rexx battled alien predators and navigational anomalies, the vastness of space both a terrifying and exhilarating backdrop to his quest.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a thrilling gamble into the unknown reaches of the galaxy.
