
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones, a city said to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold riches, a true adventurer's gamble.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission, far more sophisticated than Reginald's, was to chart unexplored star systems for the Galactic Federation, mapping the cosmos one swirling nebula and alien planet at a time.  The vastness of space, a canvas of twinkling stars and unexplored planets, dwarfed even the grandest terrestrial adventures. Yet the risks were just as profound:  uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failures presented a different kind of danger, one demanding both skill and courage.
