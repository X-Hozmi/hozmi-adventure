
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a destination whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the promise of both wonder and peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant threats, but the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover forgotten secrets, fueled her onward.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a quest for discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids made each jump a gamble.  But the potential rewards—new worlds, new civilizations, and the boundless expanse of the cosmos—were far greater than any risk.  Her adventure was not across a map, but across the very fabric of the universe.
