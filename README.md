
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland.  Her worn leather satchel, heavy with herbs and a few meager coins, held all she possessed.  Ahead lay the rumored monastery of St. Jude, a sanctuary whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the ever-present threat of the Black Death that stalked the land.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate bid against fate and the brutal reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The iridescent nebulae painted breathtaking tapestries across the viewport as Ryla navigated treacherous asteroid fields and charted unknown systems.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – cosmic radiation, rogue gravitational fields, and the ever-present danger of pirate attacks – but the potential reward, a revolution in interstellar travel, fueled her relentless pursuit.
