
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow battling the ever-present stench of unwashed bodies in her caravan.  Each creak of the wagon wheels felt like a drumbeat against the silence, broken only by the occasional hawk cry overhead and the hushed whispers of her fellow travelers, their faces etched with worry and hope as they journeyed to the fabled city of Zerzura, seeking rumored riches and escape from the encroaching plague.  The journey was fraught with peril, bandits lurking in every shadow, rivers swollen with spring melt threatening to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Nebula piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent hues a breathtaking backdrop to the perilous journey.  Navigation through the unstable wormhole had been brutal, pushing their ship to its limits, but the potential rewards were astronomical – a legendary artifact hidden on the uncharted planet of Aethel, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, braced themselves for whatever awaited them on the planet's surface, their trust in Nova's skills and the ship's resilience their only comfort against the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
