His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Alaric.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, propelled him ever closer to his elusive goal, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the dangers of the medieval world.

Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a newly colonized planet struggling against a hostile environment.

Yet, the unknown dangers lurked: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders all tested her courage and skill, as she navigated the perilous cosmic highways of the future.
