
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless expanse of the French countryside, each day a struggle against scorching heat, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need to escape the plague-ridden village he’d left behind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement, a constant reminder of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness outside, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars.  Unlike Thomas's arduous journey, Eva's was technologically advanced, yet still fraught with peril.  Asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life forms made every jump a gamble, a thrilling dance with the unknown within the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
