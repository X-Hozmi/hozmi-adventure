
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, was far from the glorious crusade promised by the King.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the threat of disease hung heavier than the oppressive heat.  Each sunrise brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, the relentless pursuit of rival knights, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, with every hardship, their resolve hardened, forged in the crucible of shared adversity and the unwavering faith that fueled their perilous odyssey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble – Xylos was notoriously unstable, riddled with gravitational anomalies and pirate activity.   The thrill of exploration warred with the ever-present risk of catastrophic engine failure or a surprise attack from the Kryll raiders.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, amplified the weight of her responsibility – the fate of a nascent civilization rested on her shoulders and the reliability of her aging starship.
