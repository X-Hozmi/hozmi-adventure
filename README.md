
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey across the known world, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainties that lay ahead.  Every mile was a victory, every sunset a prayer for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Alcubierre drive a comforting vibration against the vast emptiness of space. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies were just part of the routine. The galaxy was a vast ocean, but with every jump to hyperspace, the *Stardust Drifter* sailed closer to its destiny.
