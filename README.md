
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria, a beacon in the darkness of disease and despair, fueled his relentless journey.  He rode onward, a solitary figure against a backdrop of ancient, untamed beauty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded beyond known charted space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, far removed from the dusty trails of Reginald's era.  Yet, the loneliness of interstellar travel, the vast indifference of space, presented a similar kind of daunting isolation.  The promise of finding the colonists, a small flicker of hope in the cosmic darkness, spurred her onward, driving her through the infinite expanse.
