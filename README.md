
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, offered little comfort against the looming threat of bandits and the gnawing uncertainty of her journey to Avignon.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential harbinger of danger, a reminder of the harsh realities faced by those who dared to travel the medieval roads, chasing dreams or fleeing despair.  Survival depended on wit, courage, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy demanded precision and an unwavering nerve.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a promising new colony world, its coordinates a beacon in the cosmic darkness. Yet, the journey wasn't without peril; rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  The future held untold wonders, but reaching them required braving the treacherous currents of interstellar travel.
