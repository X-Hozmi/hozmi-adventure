
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots crunching on frozen ground.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping their land.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, yet the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their perilous journey across the unforgiving landscapes of medieval Europe.  Every creaking wagon wheel, every strained horse, marked another step closer – or perhaps further from – their desperate goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was a constant battle against the vastness of space.  Yet the thought of the colonists, their lives hanging in the balance, spurred her onward.  The cold, sterile environment of the ship paled in comparison to the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos – a constant reminder of the immense scale of her mission and the inherent risks of galactic exploration.
