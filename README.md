
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from Constantinople to Damascus.  His pack held little beyond dried dates, a chipped waterskin, and a worn map promising untold riches and adventure – a perilous journey through bandit-infested passes and scorching deserts, a gamble against starvation and exhaustion, but one worth the risk for the glory awaiting discovery.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', her breath misting in the low-gravity cockpit.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days, but in months of hyperspace transit, punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unforeseen celestial events. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, fueled her relentless pursuit across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
