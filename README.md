
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of Eldoria, and the love for his sister, fueled his weary steps, transforming the arduous journey into an epic adventure across the sprawling, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates, Eva and her crew faced unimaginable dangers across the vast expanse of the cosmos.  Each jump to hyperspace brought them closer to their goal, a beacon of hope against the overwhelming darkness of the unknown galaxy.
