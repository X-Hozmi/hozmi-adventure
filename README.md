
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's retinue as they traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their quest: to retrieve a sacred relic stolen from a monastery nestled deep within the Carpathian Mountains.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease tested their mettle, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The promise of glory, however, fueled their weary steps, the glimmer of the distant peaks a siren call amidst the endless expanse of fields and forests.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a diplomatic one, to broker peace between warring factions across three galaxies.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the inherent dangers remained.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadows, unpredictable wormholes threatened to trap her vessel, and the sheer psychological toll of interstellar travel weighed heavily on her crew. But the fate of civilizations rested on her shoulders, pushing Eva to navigate the cosmos with a steely resolve and unwavering hope.
