
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just provisions; it contains the seed of a new life, a promise whispered by her dying father – a legendary vineyard said to flourish in the hidden valley of  Aquitania. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of plague are constant companions on her arduous journey, yet Elara's spirit remains unbroken, fueled by the hope of a future rooted in sun-drenched vines and fertile soil. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset, a deeper resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Thorne pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals across three galaxies, dodging space pirates and navigating treacherous wormholes. The sleek starship hums beneath him, a symphony of futuristic technology contrasting sharply with the ancient, alien landscapes flashing by the viewport.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful canvas, holds both unimaginable riches and perilous unknowns – a gamble Rexx is willing to take for the sake of his crew and the promise of a fortune that could rewrite the galaxy's future.
