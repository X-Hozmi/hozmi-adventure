
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The King's ransom, a chest heavy with gold and jewels, was strapped to his packhorse, a tempting prize for the bandits that plagued the King's Road.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, sent a shiver down his spine.  His journey from York to Acre was a constant battle against fatigue, starvation, and the ever-present threat of violence, a true test of endurance against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space surrounding them.  Her mission was perilous; navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and facing the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems. The challenges were different, the scale unimaginable, yet the thrill of exploration, the thirst for the unknown, remained the same timeless human impulse.
