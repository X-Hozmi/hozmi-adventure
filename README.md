
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, a ribbon of brown snaking through the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and contending with unpredictable warp-drive fluctuations were all in a day's work.  But the vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos, and the knowledge that her cargo held the key to survival for thousands, fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination.
