
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Alpine passes.  My meager supplies dwindled with each sunrise, the promise of the fabled Silk Road a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.  Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the East, of spices and silks, of knowledge and adventure beyond my wildest dreams.  Each aching muscle fueled my relentless pursuit.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a lullaby against the backdrop of swirling nebulae.  We were weeks from Proxima Centauri b, the first potential habitable planet beyond our solar system.  The thrill of galactic exploration overshadowed the routine maintenance checks and the ever-present risk of encountering unforeseen celestial phenomena.  The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and untold wonders, a journey into the unknown where the next star system could hold unimaginable answers – or unimaginable peril.
