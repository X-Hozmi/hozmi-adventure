
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of silks and sweat, creaked across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced like mischievous sprites, mocking our slow progress towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present discomfort of aching muscles and blistered feet. Yet, the whispered promises of unimaginable riches and the lure of the unknown spurred us onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a vessel of gleaming chrome and pulsating energy, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and warping through spacetime became commonplace.  The thrill wasn't just about the destination - a newly discovered planet teeming with alien life - but the sheer audacity of crossing the vast emptiness between worlds, encountering uncharted nebulae and bizarre celestial phenomena, pushing the boundaries of human exploration to a scale our medieval ancestors could scarcely imagine.
