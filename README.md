
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Her journey had already been fraught with peril – bandits, scorching heat, and treacherous terrain had tested her resolve countless times.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the possibility of uncovering forgotten secrets, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a familiar thrill.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, but the breathtaking vista of a newly discovered planetary system more than made up for it.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable worlds for a burgeoning human civilization.  The vastness of space was a terrifying beauty, filled with potential riches and unimaginable dangers.  The risk was high, but the reward – the chance to expand humanity's reach across the cosmos – was worth it.
