
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs, a chipped flint, and a map promising riches and peril in equal measure.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the plague that stalked the land.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered stories of exotic silks and ancient wisdom, propelled her onward, a tiny speck against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny pinprick against an infinite canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between stars, yet the sense of adventure remained.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for unforeseen gravitational anomalies, pirate raids, or the discovery of a new, uncharted world teeming with alien life – both wondrous and deadly. The vastness of space, while offering unimaginable freedom, held a different kind of peril; a lonely isolation against the backdrop of cosmic wonder.
