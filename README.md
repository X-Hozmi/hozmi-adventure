
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her journey to the rumored monastery holding the lost scroll of Saint Brigid was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and her mount's, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the whisper of ancient magic, the chance to unravel a family mystery, spurred her onward, each step a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years away from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory Zydonian cruisers was a constant struggle, a test of piloting skill and courage. But the promise of a cure for the devastating Xylos plague, a chance to save billions, outweighed the immense risks of interstellar travel, making every warp jump a leap of faith into the breathtaking, dangerous vastness of space.
