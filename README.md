
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and claim the Sunstone, had already claimed two men to dysentery and countless more to exhaustion.  Each rocky outcrop, each whispering forest, held the potential for bandit ambushes or worse – the whispers of the mythical griffins said to guard the mountain passes.  The journey was a brutal test of endurance, a dance with both nature and man's cruelty, their reward, if they survived, a legendary treasure.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the ancient cartography of the lost K'tharr civilization.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a test of technology and nerve, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovering a new form of energy, one that could solve Earth's dwindling resources, spurred them onward, a perilous voyage fuelled by hope and the relentless hunger for discovery.
