
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of worn leather and hopeful faces, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes, dodging bandits and braving the unpredictable whims of the desert.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges:  a ford swollen by unexpected rains, a whispered rumour of a djinn's curse, the daunting sight of a seemingly endless expanse of sand.  Survival is a daily gamble, but the lure of Zerzura, a city whispered to hold unimaginable riches and secrets, keeps our spirits high despite the hardships.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life.  The journey is punctuated by the hypnotic hum of the hyperdrive, the stark beauty of nebulae painted across the blackness, and the ever-present tension of navigating asteroid fields and encountering uncharted anomalies.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life fuels our unwavering determination to reach our distant shore.
