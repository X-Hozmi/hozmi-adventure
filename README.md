
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept her constantly vigilant.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a reminder of the harsh beauty and unpredictable dangers of traversing the medieval world.  Survival depended not just on her strength and skill with a sword, but on her wits and her ability to navigate by the stars and the stories of ancient travelers.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking nebulae that painted the void with vibrant colours.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts were unreliable, and the dangers were far more alien than any medieval bandit – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile extraterrestrial life. But Ryla, driven by a fierce sense of duty and a thirst for the unknown, pressed on, her ship a tiny spark against the immeasurable vastness of space.
