
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for skilled blacksmiths to reinforce the besieged castle of Auberon, had thrust him onto this perilous journey.  Bandit infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease lay between him and his destination, a daunting prospect that fueled his determination.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or demise.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Drifter* cutting a lonely path through the cosmic dust.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Facing unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present danger of engine failure, Elara’s journey was a gamble, a desperate race against time and the unknown expanse of the galaxy.
