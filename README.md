
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of Zerzura, fueled his relentless journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and the unknown lands beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey through unmapped star systems teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the relentless pressure of deep space travel were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos, both terrifying and breathtaking, was a constant companion on her quest to push the boundaries of human exploration.
