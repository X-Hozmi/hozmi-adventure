Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Thousands of light-years from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields, each jump a gamble against the vast emptiness of space.

But the galaxy held secrets older and darker than any map could chart, and the crew faced not just cosmic hazards but also the chilling possibility of encountering entities beyond human comprehension.
