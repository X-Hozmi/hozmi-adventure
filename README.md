
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armour rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate flight.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the whispers of the Black Death chilling the very air they breathed. Each sunrise brought new peril – treacherous mountain passes, fordings swollen by relentless rain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each mile, the unwavering faith in his heart propelled him forward, spurred by the promise of sanctuary and the hope of a brighter future beyond the ravaged landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions. But unlike the medieval knights of old, Eva commanded technology far beyond their wildest dreams, relying on sophisticated navigation systems, powerful shields, and a crew of seasoned explorers bound by a shared purpose.  The journey was fraught with danger, yet the allure of discovery ignited a fire in her soul brighter than any earthly sun.
