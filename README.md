
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a daunting but necessary passage on my journey to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Rumours of its shimmering spires and untold riches fuelled my weary body, pushing me onward through blizzards and bandit ambushes, a lone knight errant seeking fortune and glory in a world steeped in both magic and brutality.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The vast, inky canvas of space, peppered with nebulae ablaze with unimaginable colours, was a breathtaking backdrop to the risks involved.  Pirate raids, navigational hazards in uncharted sectors, and the ever-present threat of system failures kept the crew on edge, but the promise of discovering new life and expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos overshadowed all fear.
