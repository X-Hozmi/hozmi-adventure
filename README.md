
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, a patchwork of faded ink and frantic scribbles, promised a legendary city hidden amidst treacherous mountains – a city said to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of the unknown, the potential for both riches and ruin.  Bandits, storms, and starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey across the uncharted lands of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues of the cosmic dust painted an alien landscape across her viewport, far removed from the dusty plains of Elara's journey. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble fueled by hope and the dwindling oxygen supplies aboard her ship.  Wormholes, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms were the perils of her interstellar voyage, a journey as fraught with danger as any medieval quest, but on a scale far grander.
