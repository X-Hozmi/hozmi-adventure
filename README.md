
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the grey sky, urged his weary mount onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring thaw threatened to sweep them away, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled their arduous trek across the vast, unforgiving landscape, the promise of solace at the journey's end their guiding star.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage spanning light-years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Advanced technology cushioned them from the harsh realities of space, but the vastness of the cosmos, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets kept her crew on edge.  The rewards, however, were potentially limitless – the discovery of a new energy source that could reshape the future of humankind.
