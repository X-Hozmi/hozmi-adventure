
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his steps, pushing him ever closer to his elusive goal across the vast and unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route connecting the Andromeda galaxy to the distant Kepler-186f system.  The journey was a dance with cosmic forces – navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and repairing critical systems under the unforgiving gaze of distant suns.  The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, made each jump into hyperspace a gamble, a thrilling test of skill and courage in pursuit of galactic exploration.
