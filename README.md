
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the parched landscape.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the sacred site spurred them onward, a beacon of hope in a world brimming with uncertainty and adventure.  Their journey was not just about reaching their destination; it was about the trials overcome, the camaraderie forged, and the stories that would be told for generations.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace; the real challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic distress signal, a jumbled mess of alien language and static.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the possibility of discovering a new civilization, and perhaps even saving lives, fuelled her determination. The cosmos offered an adventure unlike any other, a boundless frontier ripe with danger and discovery.
