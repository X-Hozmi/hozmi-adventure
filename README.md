
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zaragoza before winter's grip tightened.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the wolves and bandits that stalked these lonely trails.  This journey, a pilgrimage to find a cure for her ailing brother, was a gamble with life itself; a test of endurance and faith against the untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, the nebula of Xylos painting vibrant colours across her viewport.  Her mission: to traverse the Andromeda galaxy, searching for a lost colony ship that vanished centuries ago.  The interstellar void was a different kind of wilderness, vast and silent, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of subspace comms.  The dangers were less tangible – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters – but no less perilous than those faced by Elara on her medieval quest. The stars themselves held their breath as Eva plunged into the unknown.
