
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in silks and spices, a precarious fortune earned through months of perilous travel across the war-torn French countryside.  Bandits, disease, and the constant threat of starvation were familiar companions on his journey from the bustling port of Marseilles to the distant, fabled city of Constantinople.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, reminding him of the ever-present dangers that lurked in the shadows of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reassurance, a counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space.  While pirates and starvation were less of a concern, the challenges were equally daunting: navigating treacherous asteroid fields, maintaining the ship's fragile life support systems, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.  The thrill of exploration burned bright against the backdrop of a universe both breathtaking and terrifyingly indifferent.
