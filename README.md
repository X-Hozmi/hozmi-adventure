
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of a monstrous beast that stalked the moors sent shivers down Thomas's spine.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires spurred them onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of their medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, the unknown lurking between galaxies a constant threat.  Alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, were commonplace, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions kept her crew on edge. But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fractured civilization, fueled her unwavering determination to reach Kepler-186f, no matter the cost.
