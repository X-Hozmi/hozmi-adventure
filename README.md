
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme battling the stench of impending war. Her journey to Avignon was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a testament to her resilience.  She carried a secret message, a fragile hope clutched tight against her worn leather jerkin, its safe delivery the only goal that spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a relentless test of endurance, the crew battling cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on vulnerable transports.  Eva's mission, to deliver a rare bio-luminescent algae sample to the Andromeda Federation, was vital to the survival of countless worlds. The vast, indifferent cosmos offered no solace, but the camaraderie of her crew and the weight of her responsibility fueled her onward through the infinite darkness.
