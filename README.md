
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier between her and the fabled Sunstone city.  Each creak of her saddle, each snort from her trusty mare, echoed the anxieties in her heart.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on this perilous journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape, a journey undertaken for a stolen inheritance and a chance at a better life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation console.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars, was a different kind of hardship – the loneliness, the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, and the constant vigilance required to maintain their fragile life support systems.  Yet, the promise of discovery fueled her unwavering resolve, a testament to humanity’s boundless thirst for exploration.
