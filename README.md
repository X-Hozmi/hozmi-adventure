His journey across the breadth of the kingdom had been fraught with peril – ambushes by bandits in the Black Forest, treacherous mountain passes where the wind howled like banshees, and weeks spent battling hunger and thirst in the desolate plains.  Yet, the glint of the distant spires of Eldoria, his final destination, spurred him onward.  This quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Alora, had tested his courage and resilience, but the promise of glory and the king's favour fueled his weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was commonplace, but the unpredictable energy storms of Xylos presented a new challenge.  The journey, though technologically advanced, still demanded the same courage and resourcefulness as any medieval expedition.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, held its own unique brand of terrifying uncertainty.
