
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rides across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravages his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it offers, fuels his weary limbs and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite darkness of space. Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source on the Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure are all in a day's work.  But the vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos, with its promise of discovery and the weight of galactic responsibility, keeps her striving forward, a lone explorer in a sea of stars.
