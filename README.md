
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and untamed, and whispers of a monstrous beast guarding the coastal path kept his hand ever near his sword hilt.  Each day brought new challenges, testing his courage and resilience, but the lure of the unknown fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of thrill.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily dance with death, a far cry from the medieval knight's simpler struggles.  Yet, like Sir Kaelan, Eva was driven by an unwavering spirit of exploration, her sights set on a future amongst the stars, a future forged in the crucible of interstellar travel.
