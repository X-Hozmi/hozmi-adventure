
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees mountains did little to deter her; she was on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a journey fraught with peril but promising salvation. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the adrenaline coursing through her veins.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge, a new landscape, a new story waiting to unfold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine; the true adventure lay in the unknown, the potential for discovery both wondrous and terrifying. The vastness of space, a canvas painted with starlight and cosmic dust, held the promise of both exhilarating triumph and devastating failure.
