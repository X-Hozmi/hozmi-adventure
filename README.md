
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just provisions; it contains the King's sealed decree, a precarious mission fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test her strength and courage, and the whispers of plague follow her every step. Each sunrise brings new challenges – navigating unfamiliar rivers, bartering with suspicious villagers, and outsmarting cunning rivals all for the sake of delivering her vital message.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a spatial anomaly decades ago.  The journey is a perilous dance through asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes, each jump a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of space.  He relies on his trusty crew, their combined skills the only buffer against the cosmic terrors that lurk between galaxies, the loneliness of interstellar travel a constant companion in their quest for survival and discovery.
