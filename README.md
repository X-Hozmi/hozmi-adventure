
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of sickness hung heavy in the air.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and relying on the kindness – or the fear – of strangers for shelter. Their adventure was a tapestry woven from hardship and hope, forged in the crucible of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless unexplored star systems.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, was as perilous as any medieval landscape.  Asteroid fields threatened to shatter their ship, rogue gravitational forces could send them spiralling into oblivion, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms kept every crew member on edge.  This was exploration on a cosmic scale, a gamble for the future of humanity itself.
