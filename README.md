
Sir Gareth, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a trail in places, wound through a landscape as unforgiving as it was beautiful.  He'd traded the familiar comfort of his lord's manor for the thrill of the unknown, seeking the legendary Sunstone said to be hidden within the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains.

The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and deadly unknowns, but the allure of discovery and the promise of a better future for humanity fueled her relentless pursuit.
