
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her destination: Avignon, a city rumored to hold the key to her family's stolen inheritance.  The journey promised bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease, but the allure of reclaiming her birthright fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating flooded rivers, bartering with suspicious merchants, and outsmarting the opportunistic lords who controlled the roads.  Her loyal steed, a sturdy destrier named Valiant, was her only true companion in this perilous quest.


Conversely, centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'. The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a far cry from Elara's medieval trek, but the inherent risks remained.  Instead of bandits, he faced cosmic storms that threatened to tear his vessel apart, and instead of disease, the silent threat of spatial anomalies and unknown alien lifeforms lurked in the void between worlds.  His crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, were his companions as they charted unmapped constellations and searched for the legendary Xylos Crystal, a relic whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.
