
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked him across the treacherous terrain. The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all commonplace hazards. Yet, the promise of a brighter future, a future free from the endless cycle of interplanetary conflict, fueled her courage and drove her across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
