
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy lanes of York, a cart laden with salted meats and ale our only comfort against the biting wind.  Ahead lies the treacherous, bandit-ridden road to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fraught with peril. We'll ford icy rivers, navigate treacherous mountain passes, and bargain with suspicious merchants in dusty market towns, all while evading the ever-present threat of war and disease. Every sunrise brings the hope of reaching our destination, yet every sunset casts a long shadow of uncertainty, reminding us of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cuts through the inky blackness, its trajectory plotted across lightyears to the Kepler-186f system.  Our mission: to colonize a potentially habitable exoplanet.  The journey is long – measured in generations, not years – but the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and distant galaxies fill the viewport.  Challenges abound: navigating asteroid fields, repairing vital systems amidst the vast emptiness, and confronting the unknown alien life that might await us. Yet the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach beyond the cradle of Earth, fuels our relentless journey into the uncharted cosmos.
