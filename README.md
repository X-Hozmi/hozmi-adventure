
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier between me and the fabled city of Eldoria.  My meager supplies dwindled, mirroring my dwindling hope, yet the whispers of Eldoria's enchanted artifacts spurred me onward, a relentless beacon in the face of blizzards and bandits, a promise of untold riches and perhaps, even salvation.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of the ship’s deck, was a trial of skill and nerve.  Our mission: to retrieve the Chronarium, a device rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The risks were astronomical – pirate fleets, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of the Kryll, a sentient species who guarded the Chronarium with lethal efficiency. But the potential rewards, the unlocking of time itself, made the impossible journey worthwhile.
