
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her exiled brother, a whispered rumour of his whereabouts guiding her across treacherous mountain passes and through unforgiving forests teeming with bandits and beasts. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape to navigate, a new test of her courage and resilience in this perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, its last signal a faint whisper across light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue planets, and braving the unpredictable wormholes that connected galaxies, Ryla and her crew faced dangers far beyond anything medieval travellers could imagine. The cosmos held breathtaking beauty, but also terrifying unknowns, demanding unwavering skill and unwavering hope to reach their destination before their supplies dwindled and the silence of space consumed them.
