
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a fabled trading hub said to hold silks finer than moonlight and spices that could cure any ailment.  But the path was treacherous, shadowed by bandit-infested forests and unforgiving mountain passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril, fueling the thrill of her arduous journey – a gamble for fortune and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Rex steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula painted in hues of amethyst and emerald.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble; a single miscalculation could fling them into the void, leaving them adrift among the cold, indifferent stars. But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting new worlds and discovering new civilizations, propelled them onward, a beacon in the endless expanse of the cosmos.
