
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered rumors, was her only guide through treacherous mountain passes and lawless territories.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, a stark contrast to the whispered tales of silks, spices, and untold riches that awaited her in the East.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unmapped Kepler-186f.  Her crew, a diverse band of xeno-linguists, geologists, and engineers, monitored sensor readings as they navigated asteroid fields and navigated the complex gravitational pulls of distant suns.  The thrill of discovery fueled their mission, the potential for new life and unimaginable technology a beacon in the vast, inky blackness.  The risks were equally immense – hostile alien species, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction made each jump a gamble with the infinite.
