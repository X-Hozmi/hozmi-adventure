
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day was a gamble; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the glint of distant mountains, the shared campfire stories with fellow travelers, and the unwavering hope for Eldoria's healing balm fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving land.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning unimaginable distances and untold dangers.  Unknown celestial phenomena, hostile alien encounters, and the constant strain of maintaining the ship's delicate systems tested her crew's resilience.  But the promise of discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, and the boundless expanse of the cosmos kept them pushing forward, their hearts pounding with the rhythm of the ship's hyperdrive.
