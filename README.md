
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He’d traded his family's meager harvest for a place on this caravan heading to the fabled spice markets of the East.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each distant wolf howl, fueled his adventurous spirit.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the promise of untold riches and exotic lands kept him pushing forward, a lone figure against the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  The sleek starship, a marvel of futuristic engineering, hummed with controlled power, a stark contrast to the rickety carts of Thomas's era.  While the dangers were different – hostile alien lifeforms, rogue asteroids, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space – the thrill of discovery, the relentless push into the unknown, remained a constant thread binding these adventurers across time.
