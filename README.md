
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and fear sharp in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried across the unforgiving landscape to the distant king. Bandits lurked in the shadows, storms threatened to bury her beneath the snow, but the promise of aid spurred her onward, each aching muscle a testament to her unwavering resolve.  The journey was a gamble, a desperate act against the encroaching famine, and every mile was fraught with peril.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between galaxies. The breathtaking nebulae, swirling colours unimaginable on any terrestrial world, painted the viewport.  Their mission: to locate a legendary lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates, Ryla and her crew faced a journey that tested not only their piloting skills but also their courage and resilience. The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, making each hyperspace jump a gamble on the edge of eternity.
