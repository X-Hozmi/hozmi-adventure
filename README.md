He clutched his worn map, its faded ink barely visible in the twilight.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and magic, guarded by treacherous mountains and savage beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down his spine, a potent mix of fear and exhilarating anticipation fueling his journey across the unforgiving landscape.  This was no pilgrimage; this was a desperate gamble, a chase after a life beyond the poverty of his village.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of nebulas and distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of solar flares were daily realities.  But the quest for a new home, for a future beyond Earth’s ravaged surface, drove her and her crew onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
