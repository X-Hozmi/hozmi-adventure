
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Black Forest, shadows lengthening as dusk approached.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his journey to the Holy Land.  His quest, a pilgrimage fuelled by faith and a desperate need to atone for past sins, was a relentless test of endurance and will.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of gargantuan celestial bodies was routine, but the loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at her.  The vast, indifferent universe held both limitless wonder and unimaginable peril, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of Earth, now a distant memory.
