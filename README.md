
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He’d traded his meager inheritance for a compass, a battered map promising riches in the East, and a heart full of foolhardy ambition.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse. Yet, the allure of the unknown, of distant lands and untold wealth, spurred him on through treacherous passes and across sun-baked plains, a lone figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient, technologically advanced ruins.  The jump to hyperspace had been harrowing, the ship buffeted by gravitational forces that threatened to tear it apart.  But the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering something no human had ever seen before, overshadowed the risk.  Each star she passed, each new galaxy glimpsed, fueled her ambition – a quest not for gold, but for knowledge, across the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
