
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate moors, carrying the scent of pine and the distant threat of wolves.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present specter of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred him on, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on interstellar trade routes.  But Eva, seasoned veteran of countless deep-space missions, held firm. The potential for discovery, for a new beginning for humanity, outweighed the risks, a beacon guiding her through the inky blackness of space.
