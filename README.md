
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape of the Auvergne in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold, and the hope it represented, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck against the breathtaking tapestry of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate and secure the Xylos artifact, a legendary energy source capable of solving Earth's looming energy crisis.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the medieval knight's wildest imaginings. But the potential reward, and the fate of humanity, propelled them across the unimaginable distances of space.
