
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained the King's decree, a mission of vital importance.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for banditry, disease, or worse.  Yet, the allure of reaching the distant abbey, rumored to hold a cure for the encroaching plague, spurred her onward.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance against the elements and the unknown dangers lurking in every shadow.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields, evading the ever-present threat of pirate cruisers, and coping with the limitations of the aging hyperdrive demanded skill and courage. The cosmos was a vast, breathtaking expanse, but also a perilous one. The stakes were high, the rewards potentially limitless, and the journey a testament to humanity's unwavering thirst for exploration.
