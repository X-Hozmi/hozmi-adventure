Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.

Their mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations – but the thirst for discovery burned as brightly as ever.
