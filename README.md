
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  The stench of woodsmoke and unwashed bodies clung to the small caravan, a pungent perfume compared to the crisp, clean air atop the windswept mountains we crested each day.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, unpredictable weather threatened to derail our journey, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in legend. Yet, with every sunrise revealing new vistas and every hardship overcome, the thrill of exploration, of pushing beyond the known world, fueled our weary steps.  We sought the mythical city of Zerzura, a shimmering jewel whispered about in dusty taverns, a goal that justified the immense risks.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Through the viewport, swirling nebulae painted a canvas of unimaginable beauty, far surpassing any medieval tapestry.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize that would rewrite the laws of physics.  The journey wasn't without peril; rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system failure were hazards far more advanced than medieval bandits, but no less terrifying. Yet, the vastness of space, the promise of discovery on worlds untouched by human hands, ignited a fire in our souls, a hunger for the unknown that echoed the adventurous spirit of those medieval travelers long before us.
