
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chilling winds whipping across the desolate plains offered little respite from the relentless pursuit of the brigands who had stolen the King's sacred chalice.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a fresh surge of adrenaline through him.  His journey, a desperate race across the unforgiving landscape of medieval England, promised little but hardship and the ever-present threat of death, yet the glory of reclaiming the chalice fueled his determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant on the far side of the galaxy.  The journey, a perilous voyage through uncharted space, was fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable gravitational currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet the potential scientific breakthroughs that awaited her, and the promise of pushing humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her unwavering courage.
