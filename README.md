
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – bandits, rival knights, or perhaps the whispered-of mythical beast said to guard the lost city of Eldoria.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide, promising riches and glory to those brave enough to pursue its cryptic clues.  The journey was arduous, the dangers real, yet the lure of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent light as his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  His mission: to retrieve the fabled Chronarium, an artifact said to hold the key to manipulating time itself.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll Syndicate, a notorious intergalactic crime ring, was all in a day's work for Rexx and his crew.  The universe was their playground, and danger, their constant companion.
