
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each whispered rumour in a smoky tavern, was a step closer – or further – from her desperate goal.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all just part of the perilous journey across a land brimming with both beauty and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming spores to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between the cosmos, transforming constellations into fleeting streaks of colour. The vastness of space held its own dangers, however; rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a gamble.  The successful delivery of the spores meant the difference between life and death for a fledgling colony, a responsibility Eva carried with quiet determination across the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
