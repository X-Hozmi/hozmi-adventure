
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones at taverns across the land, was proving arduous.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of the desert city, its rumored treasures and potent magic, spurred him forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent hues, her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space krakens of the Gliese 581 system were commonplace hazards, but the allure of unlocking interstellar travel surpassed the risks.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, shared her unwavering optimism, their eyes fixed on the distant promise of a new era for humankind, one where the stars themselves were within reach.
