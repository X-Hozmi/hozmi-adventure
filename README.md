
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier on my journey to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown, a fear tempered only by the burning desire for adventure and the whispered legends that fueled my quest.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the Althea's bridge as we jumped across the Andromeda galaxy.  The swirling nebulae outside were a breathtaking canvas of cosmic dust and starlight, a far cry from the muddy tracks of my ancestor’s journey. Our mission: to chart the unmapped systems of the Xylos cluster, searching for habitable planets amid the dangers of black holes and rogue asteroids.  The thrill of exploration burned bright, a legacy passed down through generations, fueled not by legend, but by the boundless expanse of the universe itself.
