Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the distant spice markets of the East, whispered promises of unimaginable wealth and exotic wonders, fuels our weary steps.  The endless horizon holds both peril and potential, a constant reminder of the risks and rewards of medieval travel.

Conversely,  in the 27th century,  Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

Warp jumps between galaxies are commonplace, yet each one holds a sliver of unpredictable danger – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, is a treacherous landscape demanding courage, skill, and unwavering determination.
