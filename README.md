
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of pack animals and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, swift rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every mile, the allure of the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fuels our relentless journey. The sting of the dust, the aches in our bones, are mere trifles compared to the promise of discovery that lies ahead.


Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  I search for the lost colony of Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The vastness of space, the silent hum of the engines, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, are a constant reminder of the immense scale of my adventure and the potentially unimaginable discoveries awaiting me.
