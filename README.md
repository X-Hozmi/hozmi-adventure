
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, were far from the familiar comforts of their manor.  Their journey across the rugged highlands of Scotland was arduous, each day bringing new challenges: treacherous bogs, bandits lurking in shadowed glens, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled their quest—to reach the legendary Isle of Skye and retrieve a sacred relic rumored to hold the power to heal the King's sickness.  Each sunrise brought a new vista, each sunset a testament to their resilience in the face of a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding civilization.  The risks were immense – hostile alien lifeforms, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present danger of equipment failure in the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to expand human knowledge and find new homes among the stars, surpassed every fear. Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
