
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – a precious cargo destined for a monastery rumored to hold the secret to drought-resistant crops.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But Elara pressed on, driven by the hope of a bountiful harvest and the thrill of the unknown that lay beyond the next ridge.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare energy crystal vital to the survival of her colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of Kryll pirates was commonplace. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own unique dangers.  Yet, the promise of bringing life-sustaining energy back to her people spurred Nova onward, a lone adventurer charting a course through the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
