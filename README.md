
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, fueled by hope and whispered legends, keeps her weary legs moving, one painstaking step at a time.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to a newly discovered planet, Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory K'tharr warships is a constant, heart-stopping battle against the vastness of space.  The weight of billions of potential lives rests on her shoulders, a far cry from Elara's personal struggle, but the courage, resourcefulness, and unyielding determination required for success remain strikingly similar across the epochs.
