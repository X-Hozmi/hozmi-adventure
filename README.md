
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and shadowed forests.  Her quest, to reach the famed monastery of Saint Gildas in Brittany, was fraught with peril; bandits roamed the roads, and whispers of the Black Death stalked the land.  Each village offered a brief respite, a chance to replenish supplies and hear tales of other travelers, each journey a gamble against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hiss of hyperdrive and the crackle of comms chatter.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll Hegemony, a ruthless galactic empire, tested the crew's skills and their courage to the limit.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith into the unknown, a breathtaking gamble for the future of humanity.
