
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with the sun-baked dust of the plains, the chilling damp of mountain passes, and the wary eyes of strangers encountered in bustling market towns and desolate villages.  Each sunrise brought the tantalizing promise of progress, yet also the ever-present threat of bandits, famine, and the unknown landscapes that lay ahead.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous journey across the Andromeda galaxy to recover a vital bio-sample, the key to a galactic-wide plague.  Warp jumps sent jolts through the vessel as she charted a course between treacherous asteroid fields and unmapped wormholes, her crew a motley band of experts facing the risks of cosmic radiation, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the vast emptiness of space.  The galaxy stretched before them, a boundless expanse of opportunity and danger.
