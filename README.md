
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Each creak of her saddle warned of potential danger – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, or the gnawing hunger that threatened to overtake her small band of travelers.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  The journey was arduous, filled with both breathtaking vistas and terrifying encounters, but the promise of salvation spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate attacks were just a fraction of the hazards she faced, each a tiny blip on the vast, unforgiving canvas of interstellar space.  The allure of discovery, the chance to chart unmapped territories and possibly find life beyond Earth, fueled her relentless drive; a modern-day exploration mirroring the spirit of medieval adventurers, only on a scale far grander and more perilous.
