
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle alerted her to the possibility of bandits or wild beasts lurking in the shadows of the ancient oaks. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, swift rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease. Yet, the whispered tales of the city's untold riches and forgotten magic fueled her onward, a stubborn ember against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking cosmic vistas unfolding outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the thrill of discovery, the cold dread of encountering unknown alien life, and the constant hum of technology battling the unforgiving emptiness of space.
