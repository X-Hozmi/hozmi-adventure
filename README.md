In the medieval era, embarking on a journey across land was an epic adventure, a brave departure from the familiar. Knights, merchants, and pilgrims alike faced a world both vast and largely uncharted, where every mile brought new wonders and unknown perils. Leaving the relative safety of one's village or castle meant stepping into an untamed wilderness, reliant on the strength of one's spirit, the sharpness of one's blade, and the guidance of ancient, often inaccurate, maps.

The roads, often little more than muddy tracks, wound through dense forests rumored to house mythical creatures, over treacherous mountains, and across wide, windswept plains. Dangers lurked everywhere: brigands eager to waylay travelers, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease or starvation. Yet, the rewards were equally immenseâ€”the discovery of bustling market towns, the hospitality of distant lords, the awe-inspiring sight of ancient ruins, and the profound satisfaction of overcoming daunting challenges to reach a distant, dreamed-of destination.
