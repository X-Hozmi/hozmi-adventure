
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swollen, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the whispered prayers of fellow pilgrims a comfort against the harsh realities of the medieval road.  Her destination was a beacon of hope, a promise of redemption earned through hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps were treacherous, pirates a constant threat, and the alien flora of Kepler-186f held untold dangers.  But the vastness of space held a different kind of allure, a thrilling unknown that dwarfed even the medieval traveler's challenges. The cosmos was his canvas, each star a potential adventure, a chance to push the boundaries of human exploration.
