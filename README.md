
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and mortal peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages she passed.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast, uncertain darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones, a counterpoint to the cosmic silence of deep space.  While the dangers were different— asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems— the thrill of discovery, the intoxicating gamble of the unknown, echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved treacherous terrain for a glimpse of the horizon, only on a vastly grander scale.
