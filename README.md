
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a treacherous mountain pass, a hostile village, or the simple exhaustion of endless miles under a relentless sun.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve hardened, their bond strengthened, their adventure deepening with each passing league.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate drones were commonplace.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, both inspired awe and instilled a profound sense of loneliness.  The journey, measured not in leagues but in lightyears, was a test of courage, ingenuity, and the enduring human spirit, a quest for connection across the unimaginable distances that separated them from home.
