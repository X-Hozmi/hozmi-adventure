
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind the creaking wheels of my ox cart, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth. My journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of the English countryside, the fearsome tales whispered around crackling campfires, and the sting of relentless hunger.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every hardship, the spirit of adventure burned brighter, fuelled by a desire to see the world beyond my small village and to perhaps, find my fortune, or perhaps, just a little peace.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion, a far cry from the creak of cart wheels.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the galaxy stretched before us, each nebula a swirling masterpiece, each passing system a testament to the boundless expanse of the cosmos. The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life. But the thrill of exploration, the sheer audacity of venturing into the uncharted territories of space, was just as potent, if not more so, than any medieval pilgrimage.
