
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a waterskin half-empty, and a map—its creases mirroring the worry lines etched on her brow.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse. Yet, the whispers of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, propelled her forward, a beacon in the harsh reality of her journey across a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The journey between galaxies was a lonely one, punctuated only by the hum of the hyperdrive and the crackle of comms.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace. The vastness of space was daunting, the potential dangers unimaginable, but the hope for a brighter future, for a galaxy united, was a star guiding her ship across the cosmic expanse.
