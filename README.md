
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged castle of Aethelred.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, and the whispers of plague-ridden villages echoed in her ears.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, fueling the adrenaline that pushed her onward through the unforgiving landscape.  Survival, and the delivery of her message, were her only goals.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for hyperspace jumps.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the quarantined planet of Aethel, a world teeming with unpredictable alien lifeforms and ancient, powerful technology.  The thrill of discovery warred with the ever-present danger, the vastness of space a humbling backdrop to the perilous task at hand. The galaxy was her battlefield, and the fate of countless worlds rested on her successful return.
