
The year is 1348.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a risky trade but necessary to save her family's failing farm.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, brought a prickle of fear – bandits were a constant threat, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air.  She pressed on, driven by desperation and the faint hope of reaching the bustling port city of Marseilles before nightfall.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes steered her starship, *The Wanderer*, through a nebula of vibrant, swirling colours.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival on a dying Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against unknown dangers lurking in the vast expanse of the cosmos.  The loneliness of space was a heavy burden, but the promise of discovery – of new worlds, new life – fuelled her unwavering determination.
