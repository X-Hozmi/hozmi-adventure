
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones amongst merchants and pilgrims.  The trail was treacherous, riddled with bandits and overgrown with thorny brambles, but the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fueled her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder that survival, and perhaps even glory, depended on her courage and cunning.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla 'Starfall' Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, fraught with the danger of spatial anomalies and pirate raids, but the potential discovery of new worlds, teeming with life and resources, outweighed the perils. The vast, breathtaking beauty of the universe, a constant reminder of humanity's insignificance and limitless potential, spurred her crew onward.
