
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guides her towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the endless expanse of wilderness teems with unknown dangers – wild beasts, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of legend and the thrill of the unknown propel her onward, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The vast expanse of space offers a different kind of challenge;  navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown reaches of the galaxy. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and uncharted territories fuels her ambition, making the risks worthwhile. The cosmos unfolds before her, a breathtaking tapestry of wonder and peril.
