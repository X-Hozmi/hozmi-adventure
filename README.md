
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous bogs, bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient oaks, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the legendary city of Ys, whispered to be hidden beyond the mountains, fueled his perilous journey, a quest that promised both glory and untold riches, or perhaps a grim and forgotten grave.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship's Alcubierre drive to its limits.  Now, they navigated a field of asteroid debris, each fragment a potential death sentence.  But the reward, the rumored existence of a pre-sentient civilization on the planet Kepler-186f, outweighed the inherent danger.  Eva, her gaze fixed on the navigation console's flickering lights, knew that the cosmos held both unimaginable wonders and catastrophic unknowns, and tonight, she faced the latter.
