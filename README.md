
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim their lives, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at their bellies.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies, and facing the constant threat of the unknown. Yet, the allure of the sacred shrine, whispered promises of healing and redemption, spurred them forward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of space. Her mission: to chart a new trade route to the Xylos system, a gamble that could either bring unimaginable wealth to the Sol Federation or leave her crew stranded amongst the uncharted nebulae.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same.
