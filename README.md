
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her quest: to reach Avignon before the Black Death claimed her family.  Each sunrise brought the chilling reminder of her vulnerability; bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her every step.  Yet, the burning hope of reunion fueled her onward, transforming the arduous journey into a testament to human resilience and the unwavering bonds of family.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos pulsed with vibrant colours and hidden dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of the unknown, and the potential to reshape galactic travel, propelled him across the vast emptiness between worlds, a lone adventurer in the grand expanse of the universe.
