
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the harsh desert sun.  Bandits lurked in every shadow, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion, more threatening than any brigand. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of ancient secrets, spurred her onward. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the brush, heightened the adventure, a constant gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of legend.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields were the challenges of her journey.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing humanity’s boundaries beyond the known cosmos, fuelled her unwavering determination, making each jump between star systems a thrilling leap into the unknown.
