
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting reminder of the unforgiving landscape.  Her worn map, clutched tightly in her hand, promised riches in the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis hidden deep within the desert.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, sparked a fresh wave of apprehension, but the lure of untold treasures and the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, indifferent wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the cold light of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out habitable planets.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the shimmering trails of distant stars and the silent majesty of nebulae, presented a different kind of peril, a cosmic vastness that dwarfed even the medieval world's wild lands.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds teeming with possibilities, fueled Eva's courage as she steered her vessel towards the edge of the known universe.
