
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the bleak, snow-covered plains, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards he’d left behind weeks ago. His quest: to recover the stolen relic of St. Elara, a journey that had already taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy dens of bandits. Each day brought new perils – starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of armed conflict – yet the unwavering hope of success spurred him onwards.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer hardened by countless voyages across the galaxy, felt a familiar thrill – the thrill of the unknown, the tantalizing prospect of discovery, and the satisfaction of pushing humanity's boundaries further into the vast, uncharted cosmos.
