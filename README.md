
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the weight of his squire's supplies a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel and snort of his horse marked another mile closer to the unknown, a land fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the hope of salvation fueled their relentless advance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  The mission: a decades-long expedition to chart unexplored sectors and search for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the dangers remained: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant hum of loneliness that echoed through the ship's silent corridors.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the promise of new worlds, propelled her onward into the uncharted cosmos.
