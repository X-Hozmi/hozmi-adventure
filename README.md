
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons,  rivers ran dry, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's determination burned brighter, fueled by the promise of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown that beckoned her across this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and asteroid fields was commonplace for Ryla and her crew; their mission, to chart the unmapped regions of space in search of habitable worlds.  The vastness of the cosmos held both wonder and danger –  unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure were constant companions. But the prospect of discovering new civilizations, new planets teeming with life beyond human comprehension, made the risks worthwhile, pushing Ryla and her crew ever further into the unexplored expanse.
