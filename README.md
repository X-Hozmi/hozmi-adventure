
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the secrets of ancient healing – a desperate quest for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the glint of the distant peaks fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent expanse of space punctuated only by the occasional flicker of distant stars.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, yet the promise of new worlds and untold discoveries pushed Eva and her crew further into the inky black, boldly venturing where no human had gone before.
