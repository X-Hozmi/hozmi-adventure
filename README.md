
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat and a chipped flint, but her heart swelled with the thrill of the unknown.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, promised adventure.  She was bound for the rumored city of Carcassonne, a whispered legend among her people, a place of untold riches and perhaps, a new life.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the allure of the journey itself, the freedom of the open road, outweighed every risk.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting drone against the vast, silent expanse of space.  While the dangers were different – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the unpredictable nature of alien encounters – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Each jump to hyperspace, each scan of a new planetary system, fueled her insatiable curiosity.  For Eva, the final frontier was not just a vast unknown, but a canvas upon which she would paint her own personal legend among the stars.
