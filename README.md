
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his armor clanking, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the grim reality of a journey far from over, a gamble with fate played out against a backdrop of unforgiving landscapes and medieval uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her resolve.  But the potential discovery, a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, fueled her ambition, making the unimaginable distances and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning warp drives a small price to pay.
