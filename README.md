
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the dust-choked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present exhaustion that weighs heavy on our shoulders. Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, the whispered promises of unimaginable riches in Cathay, drive us onward. We brave scorching deserts, navigate treacherous mountain passes, and barter our lives for a night's meager shelter, all for a glimpse of the Eastern wonders.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, each jump a calculated risk.  The cosmos, a canvas of breathtaking nebulae and uncharted systems, holds both wonder and peril. We hunt for rare minerals in asteroid fields, navigate treacherous gravitational wells, and face down alien predators, all in pursuit of the legendary Xylos star, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The universe stretches before us, an infinite ocean of possibilities and unknown dangers.
