
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the Kingdom of Francia had been brutal; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes testing both man and beast, and the endless, unforgiving expanse of the plains.  But the whispers of a legendary lost city, said to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge, fueled his relentless pursuit.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset the chilling reminder of the dangers that still lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigation was treacherous, dodging asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars.  But the potential scientific breakthrough hidden within that data core—a potential cure for a devastating galactic plague—was worth the risks.  The vast, uncharted cosmos held both wonder and peril in equal measure, and Eva pressed on, a lone voyager against the immensity of space.
