
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the rough terrain tested her endurance daily, and the gnawing hunger often outweighed her thirst for the holy city.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a thrilling mix of fear and determination fueling her onward progress.  She carried with her not only her worn satchel but also the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer, defying the odds with every step.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been a risky one, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its absolute limit.  Now, surrounded by the breathtaking colours of a thousand dying stars, he navigated asteroid fields and avoided the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a legendary energy source rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a terrifying beauty, held both immense danger and the promise of untold riches for those daring enough to brave its depths.
