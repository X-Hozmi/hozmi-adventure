
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was proving far more arduous than the chronicles had described.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the endless expanse of the steppe offered little respite from the sun's relentless glare.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a testament to their resilience, their quest for the mythical Sunstone fueling their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints, but the breathtaking vista of the nebula's iridescent hues was a worthy reward.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards in the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy, but the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, and the camaraderie of her crew kept Eva's spirits soaring, despite the ever-present danger.
