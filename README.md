Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had tested them both.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease had become as familiar as the rhythmic clop of hooves on cobblestone.

Their mission – to survey a newly discovered planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel –  was fraught with danger, but the allure of unlocking the galaxy's deepest secrets spurred them onward, a testament to human ambition in the face of the infinite.
