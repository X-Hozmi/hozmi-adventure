
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, a worn map clutched in her hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered stories of Ys’s magical power, fueled her onward, a tiny figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across multiple planets after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of intergalactic travel permits and the loneliness of deep space. But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fractured civilization, propelled her through the inky blackness, a lone explorer charting the uncharted galaxies.
