
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Saragossa, a whispered legend of untold riches and even more dangerous secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the bandits, the wild beasts, and the unpredictable terrain that threatened to swallow her whole on this perilous journey across the medieval world.  Survival depended not only on her strength but also her wits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-samples across galaxies, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Cosmic storms raged outside, threatening to tear her vessel apart, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed large.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant planets, fueled her relentless pursuit of her objective, a testament to human ambition and the enduring allure of exploring the unknown.
