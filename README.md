
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather jerkin, patched countless times, offered little protection from the relentless heat.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, fueled her onward.  The legendary silk, the exotic spices, the promise of untold riches – these dreams spurred her across the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, while faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation threatened the ship's integrity, asteroid fields demanded precise navigation, and the vast emptiness of space fostered a profound sense of isolation.  But the potential discovery of alien life, the expansion of human knowledge, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories were rewards worth the immense risks.
