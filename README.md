
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s worn leather jerkin as his mount, a sturdy destrier named Beowulf, picked its way across the parched, sun-baked earth.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a whispered legend amongst desert nomads, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in canyons, mirages mocked their thirst, and the endless expanse of sand threatened to swallow them whole. Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown spurred them onward, a knight errant and his loyal steed against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant hues a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the control panel. Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped Xylos galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The risks were immense – unknown celestial phenomena, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors leading to oblivion.  But the promise of a new home, a new beginning, fueled her resolve, a lone explorer navigating the cosmic ocean in search of a new dawn.
