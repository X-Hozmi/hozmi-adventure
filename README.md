
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promises a legendary lost city nestled beyond the whispering forests.  Each day brings new challenges: treacherous mountain trails, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing hunger.  But the allure of discovery, the whispered tales of forgotten magic and untold riches, fuels her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and breathtaking beauty.  Warp drives hum, artificial gravity holds firm, but the vastness of space, punctuated only by the cold, distant glow of stars, breeds a different kind of isolation.  The adventure isn't merely physical; it's a mental battle against loneliness, the constant threat of malfunction, and the weight of responsibility for her crew's safety.
