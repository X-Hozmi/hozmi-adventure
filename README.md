
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked tracks as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers and the slim hope of drawing closer to his elusive goal.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages offered fleeting comfort, a reminder of the human tenacity that fueled his perilous adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across a dozen planets in three different galaxies.  Hyperspace jumps brought sudden, breathtaking shifts in scenery - from vibrant purple suns to swirling cosmic dust clouds.  While pirates and rogue AI posed threats far different than Thomas's, the isolation of space and the vastness of the unknown mirrored the challenges of his medieval journey.  Both faced the daunting unknown, driven by a thirst for discovery and a resilience honed by the very hardships they encountered.
