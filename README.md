
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and a map older than her grandfather, was a constant companion.  The journey to the rumored lost city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the whisper of legend fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast unknown.  She sought not gold, but knowledge, a thirst for discovery that burned brighter than any sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the silent hum of the hyperdrive a constant reminder of the fragility of their vessel against the cosmic expanse.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble with the unknown, but the promise of new worlds, of new life, spurred her onward.  The exploration of the cosmos was a far cry from medieval quests, but the human spirit of adventure, the unwavering thirst for discovery, remained unchanged.
