
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just meager rations; it contains the King's missive, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city far to the east.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are but minor obstacles in her quest.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet Elara presses on, fueled by a mixture of duty and a fierce, independent spirit that burns brighter than the midday sun.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the myriad planets of this unexplored sector.  Faster-than-light travel offers a deceptive sense of speed, the vastness of space still a daunting reality.  He battles not just the cosmic dangers – asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies – but also the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present threat of pirate factions lurking in the shadowy corners of the galaxy.  His journey is a testament to human resilience, a relentless pursuit across the uncharted cosmos.
