
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's small band of knights crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey across the Holy Roman Empire had been brutal; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Zerzura, brimming with untold riches and arcane knowledge, spurred them onward, a shimmering mirage in the desert of their hardships.  Each aching muscle, each blister, fueled their desperate hope.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Alcubierre drive a constant thrum beneath her feet.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away, and a world brimming with dangers both natural and engineered.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, held a stark and captivating terror, a counterpoint to the intense pressure of her mission's urgency.
