
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadows of the Pyrenees Mountains were less daunting than the quest before her: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril but vital to the kingdom's survival. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a thrilling gamble against the unpredictable landscape and its lurking dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold vacuum of space.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage across unmapped star systems teeming with unknown celestial phenomena. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast emptiness, as Eva and her crew faced the unimaginable distances and potential threats of interstellar travel – a grand adventure amongst the stars.
