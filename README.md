
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles in his path, but the lure of Eldoria, and the glory that finding it would bring, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his horse, was a step closer to destiny, or perhaps, destruction.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and dealing with the unpredictable quantum currents of the nebula tested her skill and the ship's resilience to the extreme.  The vast, alien landscape of space, both beautiful and deadly, promised untold rewards but also the potential for catastrophic failure – a gamble Eva was willing to take for the sake of humanity's future.
