
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold healing powers for her ailing brother, had been fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested her resilience.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny flicker against the immensity of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey spanning lightyears and countless celestial obstacles.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering determination. The vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy held both immense danger and the promise of discovery, a thrilling yet perilous voyage across the cosmic sea.
