
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his small band spurred their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of a powerful sorcerer.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun baking their skin, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each towering mountain range, each treacherous river crossing, brought them closer to their elusive goal, but also presented a fresh wave of peril. The journey tested their courage, their loyalty, and their very survival.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions made every jump a gamble.  But the promise of a new life, a new beginning for humanity among the stars, fuelled her determination.
