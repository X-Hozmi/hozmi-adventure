
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him after weeks of relentless travel, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mocking his thirst. His journey across the Holy Roman Empire, undertaken to reclaim his stolen inheritance, had been fraught with peril. Bandits had waylaid him in the Black Forest, forcing him to rely on his wits and rusty swordsmanship to survive.  Now, only the treacherous mountain pass separated him from his destination, a journey as perilous as any battle.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a jewel-toned world orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid field had tested her skills to the limit, and the comms system remained stubbornly silent, leaving her alone in the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  But the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, propelled her forward, a descendant of those medieval adventurers, driven by a similar thirst for exploration.
