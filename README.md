
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn leather map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little comfort against the looming storm clouds.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a destination worth risking brigands, starvation, and the unpredictable fury of nature.  Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath of her loyal beast, was a step closer to the unknown, a thrilling gamble against fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, plotting a course through asteroid fields and uncharted gravitational anomalies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glitter of galaxies, both terrified and exhilarated her. This was exploration on a cosmic scale, a journey beyond human comprehension, demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of blind faith in the stars.
