
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, guides his weary horse through the dense Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing his plague-stricken village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for bandit ambush or worse, yet the unwavering hope of salvation fuels his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  He faces treacherous mountains, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the promise of Ys burns brighter than any fear.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *The Icarus*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish first contact with a newly discovered sentient species on the distant planet Kepler-186f.  The journey is arduous, spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, cosmic radiation, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  While the challenges are vastly different from Sir Kaelan's, the spirit of adventure remains the same – a relentless pursuit of the unknown, fueled by courage, curiosity, and the unwavering belief in a destination worth reaching, no matter the cost.
