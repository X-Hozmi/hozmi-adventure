
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant Abbey of Saint-Michel. Bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the unwavering determination in her eyes burned brighter than any hardship. Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the land, fueled her resolve to reach her destination and bring salvation home.

Centuries later, Captain Jax's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae painted breathtaking canvases across the viewport, a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace. The perils were different – warp storms, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present danger of technological failure – but the thrill of exploration, the relentless pursuit of a distant goal, mirrored the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved the unknown on foot and by beast.
