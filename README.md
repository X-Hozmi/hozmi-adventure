
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a clumsy serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, inched across the sun-baked plains.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present discomfort of dust and disease. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, whispering promises of exotic spices and untold riches, pushed us onward. The towering mountains in the distance, a jagged silhouette against the fiery sunset, represented both a challenge and a hope, a testament to the arduous journey and the potential rewards that lay beyond.


Millennia later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship humming with controlled chaos, pierced the inky blackness, charting a course through uncharted nebulae.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life unlike anything humanity had ever encountered. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the cold brilliance of distant suns, held a different kind of terror than the bandits of old, but the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of the known universe, fueled our journey across the light years.
