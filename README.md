
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of  Aethelred, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable spring rains, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the lonely stretches of moorland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing her resilience and resourcefulness, but the promise of healing fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain expanse of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the 'Starseeker', a nebula of swirling purple and gold painting the viewport. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the political intrigues of alien races were just some of the hurdles she faced.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented constant challenges, but the potential rewards—unlocking galactic exploration for humanity—made the risks worthwhile.
