
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the unforgiving Breton countryside had been brutal; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the constant threat of dysentery a shadow hanging over every mile.  Yet, the lure of the mythical lost city of Ys, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred him on.  He carried with him a tattered map, a compass spinning wildly under a sky perpetually veiled in grey, and the unwavering hope of finding untold riches and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The journey between galaxies was far less arduous than the medieval trails, though fraught with its own perils: rogue asteroids the size of moons, solar flares that threatened to fry her navigational systems, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien factions vying for control of the valuable Xylossian spice.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to chart unmapped territories and encounter alien civilizations, made the risk worthwhile.  The universe awaited.
