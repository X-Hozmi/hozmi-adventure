
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, said to hold ancient magic and untold riches, but the path was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the sheer cliffs threatened to send both her and her weary beast tumbling into the abyss.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh shiver of apprehension down her spine, fueling her determination to reach her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Xylos was rough, the warp drive groaning under the strain of traversing the Cygnus X-1 black hole's gravitational pull.  Ahead lay the fabled Xylos Nebula, a swirling tapestry of gas and dust promising unimaginable wealth in rare minerals and perhaps, a glimpse of the legendary Kryll civilization.  But the nebula was a graveyard for countless ships, lost to its treacherous currents and unpredictable energy storms.  The fate of his crew, and the bounty promised by the Galactic Consortium, hung precariously in the balance.
