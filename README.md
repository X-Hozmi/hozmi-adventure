
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the mountains – a sanctuary rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled a mixture of fear and exhilaration. Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant threats, yet the lure of the unknown pushed her ever closer to her perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue solar flares were commonplace dangers, but the ultimate risk – finding a world already inhabited, or discovering a planet hostile to human life – was a constant weight on her shoulders. The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the potential perils.
