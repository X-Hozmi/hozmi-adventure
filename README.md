
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a chipped map, her only companions the gnawing hunger in her belly and the persistent whisper of the wind.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each flash of steel in the distance represented a potential threat or fleeting hope in her perilous journey to the distant port city, a voyage fraught with bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Reaching her destination meant survival, a chance at a new life, a gamble she was willing to take.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and uncharted wormholes was a daily challenge; the hum of the hyperdrive a constant background to the thrill of exploration.  Her crew, a diverse band of xeno-biologists, cartographers and engineers, worked in harmony, their collective knowledge pushing the boundaries of human understanding.  Their mission: to locate a habitable planet for a struggling Earth, a quest demanding courage, precision and a deep, unwavering belief in the possibility of a future beyond the dying embers of their home world.
