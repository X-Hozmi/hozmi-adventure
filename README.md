
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their trusty warhorse, Bess,  rode relentlessly across the sun-baked plains of France. Their quest: to recover the stolen reliquary of Saint Jude from a shadowy order rumored to dwell in the Carpathian mountains.  Every creak of their saddlebags, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse. Their journey was a tapestry woven with breathtaking vistas, perilous mountain passes, and the ever-present shadow of uncertainty, a true medieval adventure demanding courage, resilience, and unwavering loyalty.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer', a sleek starship hurtling through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of warping spacetime.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile K'tharr cruisers, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, punctuated by the vibrant hues of nebulae and the chilling darkness of empty void, presented a different kind of adventure, one where the stakes were galactic and the unknown stretched to infinity.
