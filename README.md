
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to a distant monastery, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the very air hangs heavy with the threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings a fresh challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in hostile villages, and always, the gnawing fear of being swallowed whole by the vast, indifferent wilderness.  Her only companions are her loyal steed and the unwavering resolve burning in her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Jackson pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable cosmic hazards.  Nebula storms threaten to rip apart his ship, unknown alien lifeforms lurk in the void between stars, and the ever-present threat of navigation errors could leave him stranded in the infinite darkness.  But Jax, hardened by countless voyages, presses onward, fueled by the hope of finding his missing kin and the relentless pursuit of the unknown across the vast expanse of space.
