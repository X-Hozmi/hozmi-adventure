
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, a parchment map clutched tight in his gauntlet.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings fresh peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria, and the hope it represents, fuels his weary body and spurs him onward, a solitary knight against the vast, indifferent wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship 'Stardust', charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet teeming with life-sustaining resources.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies, Elara and her crew face a different kind of wilderness – the infinite expanse of space.  But the promise of a new beginning, a habitable world for a dying Earth, drives them across unimaginable distances, explorers pushing the boundaries of human endurance and technology.
