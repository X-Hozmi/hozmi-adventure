
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey – a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Eadric – had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the endless expanse of the land itself tested their endurance.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The hyperdrive hummed, a deep thrum that vibrated through her bones as they leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the dazzling spectacle of nebulae and distant star systems, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the relentless wear and tear of interstellar travel were just some of the hazards she faced in her quest.
