
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the plague devastating her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present shadow of disease itself. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of salvation, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, the alien landscapes a constant source of surprise and peril – treacherous asteroid fields, hostile sentient lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failures.  But Ryla, like Elara before her, was driven by a powerful purpose, a commitment to finding answers and forging a path through the vast, uncharted territories of space.
