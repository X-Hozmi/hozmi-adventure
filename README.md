
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, trudges across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – bandit raids lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its whispers of opulent cities and exotic spices, keeps our spirits aloft.  Every mile is a victory, a testament to human endurance against the harsh indifference of nature and the greed of men.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship shimmering with captured starlight, leaps across the void between galaxies. Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to immortality.  The journey is less about physical hardship and more about the psychological strain of interstellar travel; the crushing loneliness of the void, the unpredictable nature of wormhole jumps, and the constant hum of the Althea's engines a perpetual reminder of our isolation.  Yet, the promise of a longer life, and the unknown wonders of Xylos, fuel our relentless pursuit across the unimaginable distances of space.
