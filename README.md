
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin stained with the mud of a thousand miles, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of Europe had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested his spirit and his mettle.  But the glint of the promised city, shimmering on the horizon, spurred him onward.  The legendary lost city of Eldoria, with its rumored untold riches and arcane knowledge, was within his grasp.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a viable colony site amongst the uncharted star systems beyond the known galaxy.  The journey was a symphony of warp jumps and calculated risks, navigating asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of hull breaches in the unforgiving void.  But the potential for discovery, the chance to carve out a new future for humanity amongst the stars, was a reward far greater than any earthly treasure.
