
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest, to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and cunning, fueling her relentless drive toward the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking vista of cosmic colours. His mission: to deliver vital resources to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.  Facing unpredictable wormhole distortions, pirate attacks from the shadowy Kryll Syndicate, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel, Rexx relied on his seasoned crew and advanced technology to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents, a modern-day adventurer pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
