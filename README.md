
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of  Zaragoza, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, and the treacherous mountain passes demanded unwavering vigilance.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of adrenaline through her, a thrilling counterpoint to the gnawing hunger in her belly.  The adventure, however, was worth the risk.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Navigation through uncharted space, dodging asteroid fields and the occasional rogue pirate vessel, demanded unwavering skill and nerves of steel.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a journey promised untold riches and unimaginable danger.  The thrill of exploration burned brighter than any star.
