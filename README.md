
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whisper of hope, fueled by the desperate need to save her brother, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating through nebulae of impossible beauty and dodging asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize her vessel, Ryla sought the lost colony of Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The loneliness of space was a constant companion, broken only by the hum of the engines and the crackle of her comms system. But the lure of discovery, the promise of a breakthrough for humanity, outweighed the vast, terrifying emptiness that surrounded her.
