
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance in the shimmering heat, mirroring the restless energy within our ranks.  Each day brings the threat of bandit raids, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered of in hushed tones at evening fires, fuels our relentless westward push.  The rough-hewn tracks, barely more than goat paths, are our only guide through a landscape both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, the stars are our compass.  The gargantuan interstellar freighter *Stardust Drifter* groans under the strain of its warp drive, hurtling us toward the Andromeda Galaxy.  Through the viewport, nebulae swirl in impossible colours, a kaleidoscope of celestial beauty that belies the danger inherent in traversing uncharted space.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the void.  The whispers of pirates and rogue AI linger in the comms chatter, a constant reminder that the vastness of space is as perilous as any medieval wilderness, but instead of bandits, we face cosmic horrors and the relentless indifference of the universe.
