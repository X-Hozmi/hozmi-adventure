
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he urged the weary animal onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Black Forest, a journey fraught with peril from both man and beast.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay ahead – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been harrowing, a near miss with a rogue asteroid field leaving her shields flickering.  Her mission: to establish contact with the rumored sentient Kryll civilization, a species whose existence was only whispered amongst the galactic explorers' guilds.  Though vastly different from Kaelan's plight, her journey was equally perilous, fraught with the unpredictable dangers of warp storms, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning technology in the vast, unknowable expanse of space.
