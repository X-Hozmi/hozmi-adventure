
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked roads of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained a stolen map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the endless expanse of forest whispered of mythical beasts, but the lure of the unknown fueled her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of uncharted planets was routine, but the thrill of discovery never faded.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have mastered faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the promise of a lost civilization, and the chance to expand human knowledge, made the risks worthwhile.
