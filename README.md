
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a loveless marriage.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of leaves in the darkening forest, fueled her apprehension and exhilaration in equal measure. Bandits, disease, and the sheer unpredictable nature of the medieval world lay ahead, yet the lure of the unknown – of a distant monastery promising sanctuary and a chance at peace – propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and pirate raids.  Instead of a monastery, her destination was Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next evolutionary leap – a technology that could bridge the vast distances between galaxies.  The cold emptiness of space offered a different kind of loneliness than Elara’s journey, yet the thrill of discovery and the potential to reshape the future drove Comet onward, a modern-day adventurer forging her path amidst the stars.
