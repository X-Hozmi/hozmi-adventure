
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of Zerzura, a shimmer on the horizon of his dreams, propelled him forward, a testament to the enduring human spirit facing unimaginable hardship for a single, desperate hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the fleeing remnants of humanity.  Warp drives hummed, starlight painting streaks across her viewport as she navigated asteroid fields and navigated the treacherous gravitational pull of nebulae.  Unlike Thomas, she faced dangers far removed from human scale, but the same courageous spirit burned within her – a determination to find a future, a new dawn, amongst the cold, indifferent vastness of space.
