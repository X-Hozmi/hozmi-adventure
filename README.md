
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rough terrain tested their mounts daily.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – crossing treacherous rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, or bartering for meager provisions in dusty, forgotten villages.  Their only companions were the whispering wind, the vast expanse of the sky, and the unwavering faith that fueled their arduous trek.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily occurrence.  Communication with Earth was intermittent, the vast distances creating a frustrating lag.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to uncover the fate of humanity's first interstellar settlers, kept the crew pushing forward, their hearts echoing with the adventurous spirit of those medieval pilgrims who had braved a different kind of unknown.
