
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried figs and water skins; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from the plague-ridden villages of her homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a heartbeat in the symphony of her perilous journey. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her pilgrimage toward the fabled city of Trebizond, a shimmering beacon of promise on the far horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, masking the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  While pirates and asteroid fields replaced bandits and mountains, the constant threat of system malfunctions and unknown celestial anomalies made her journey no less perilous.  The search for a new home for humanity was a burden, and a privilege, she carried with unwavering courage into the inky black.
