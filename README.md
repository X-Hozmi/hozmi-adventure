
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its faded ink depicting a perilous route through the whispering forests and over the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  His quest? To find the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold riches – or a grim end to his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth, rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Elara.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of discovering something never before seen by human eyes, fueled her relentless pursuit across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
