
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as his weary steed picked its way through the rutted track.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, each sunrise revealing another vista of windswept plains and treacherous mountain passes.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the relentless sun beat down on man and beast alike.  Yet, the whispered promise of Jerusalem, the fervor of his faith, spurred him onward, each hardship a testament to his devotion, each mile a step closer to his sacred goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril – unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  But the allure of discovery, the possibility of encountering new life, fueled her crew's determination.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime, but the reward—a new world—was worth the impossible odds.
