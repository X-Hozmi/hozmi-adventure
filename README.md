
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages to navigating by the stars under a vast, indifferent sky. Yet, the whisper of Zerzura's lost glories fueled her onward, a siren song of adventure amidst the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation involved navigating asteroid fields, recalibrating the hyperdrive in the face of unpredictable stellar currents, and dealing with the occasional pirate raid – though their methods now involved sophisticated energy weapons rather than cutlasses.  While the technology offered a degree of safety unknown to Elara, the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel created a different kind of danger, a lonely struggle against the indifference of the cosmos.
