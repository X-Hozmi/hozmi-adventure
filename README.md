
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a powerful, lost magic.  Days blurred into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the tantalizing hope of finally reaching their destination, a city shrouded in mystery and legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted towards the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, spanning light years, was punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the breathtaking spectacle of cosmic wonders unseen by human eyes.  They sought a new home for humanity, a planet capable of sustaining life amidst the dying embers of their own sun.  The risks were immense – hostile alien life, navigation hazards, and the constant threat of system failure – yet the potential reward, a new dawn for humankind, propelled them forward into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
