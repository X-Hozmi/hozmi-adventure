
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey, a tapestry woven with hardship, resilience, and the breathtaking beauty of a world both brutal and magnificent.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace.  Advanced technology mitigated some of the risks, but the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of connecting with a long-lost civilization, burned brighter than any star, driving her and her crew across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
