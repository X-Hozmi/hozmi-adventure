
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal landscape, the scent of rosemary and impending storm clinging to the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, a quest fueled by both a desperate need for healing herbs and the lure of the unknown. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences in her relentless pursuit of legend. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a signal their only guide through the light-years of empty void.  Hyperjumps, asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirate raiders tested the crew's mettle and their vessel's integrity.  The promise of a new beginning, a chance to rebuild a shattered civilization, spurred them onward through the cosmic expanse, a journey far more perilous, yet no less thrilling, than any medieval quest.
