Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in taverns and sung of by wandering bards.  Her journey had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the legendary Sunstone said to lie within its walls, fueled her onward, a stubborn ember against the cold realities of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson light painting his starship's hull in ethereal hues.  His destination: Xylos, a planet on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of the engines and the occasional hiss of the hyperdrive.  But the vast emptiness of space held a different kind of allure – a silent, star-dusted majesty that dwarfed even the most perilous terrestrial landscape.  The galaxy was his highway, and the cosmos, his destination.
