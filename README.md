
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandit ambush, wild beast attack, or the even greater unknown.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with the camaraderie of fellow travelers, the harsh beauty of desolate landscapes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unforgiving wilderness.  Zerzura, if it even existed, felt as distant as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic hyperspace jump malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Eva relied on her trusty crew and cutting-edge technology. The vast emptiness of space, however, pressed in on them, a relentless reminder of their isolation and the daunting scale of their search.  The fate of New Eden, and perhaps the future of humanity, rested on their shoulders.
