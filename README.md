
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than the rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Brigid.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary mile, brought her closer to her goal, a thrilling mix of trepidation and unwavering determination fueling her journey across the perilous landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unmapped galaxy of Andromeda.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, held their breath as the ship navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets. The promise of untold riches and scientific discovery far outweighed the risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms or succumbing to the dangers of hyperspace, making this interstellar voyage a gamble worth taking.
