
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  His journey across the kingdom of Aeridor had been fraught with peril – bandits ambushed them near the Whispering Woods, a blizzard nearly claimed them in the Grey Mountains, and the treacherous Black Mire tested their resolve to its limits.  But the promise of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the King’s ailing son, spurred him onward, each hardship fueling his determination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the newly constructed hyperspace gate from the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates was commonplace, yet the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, with its swirling nebulas and distant galaxies, constantly reminded her of the awe-inspiring vastness of the universe and the profound risks, and rewards, of interstellar travel.
