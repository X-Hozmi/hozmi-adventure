
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s weary horse as she crests another sun-baked hill, the spires of her destination, the fabled city of Zerzura, still a distant shimmer on the horizon.  For months she’s traversed treacherous mountain passes, dodged bandit ambushes in shadowy forests, and bartered for meager supplies in dusty villages.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – a swollen river to ford, a hostile lord to appease, a crippling sandstorm to endure – but the whispered promise of Zerzura, a city said to hold the key to her family's lost legacy, fuels her onward.

A thousand years hence, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way. The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, uncaring darkness. Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, a nebula rumored to contain a source of near-limitless energy. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, and repairing critical systems under pressure are all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew, their courage and ingenuity their only shields against the infinite dangers of interstellar travel.
