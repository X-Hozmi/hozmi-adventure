
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of ancient forests teeming with both wild beasts and worse.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the promise of divine intervention, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  The journey was a marathon, spanning light years and demanding constant vigilance against cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Advanced technology lessened the physical hardship, but the isolation and the sheer vastness of space brought a unique kind of terror.  The weight of her crew's lives, and the hope of finding a lost civilization, rested on her shoulders as she navigated the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
