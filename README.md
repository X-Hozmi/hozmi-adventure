
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in the form of a smuggled ruby, her ticket to a new life across the treacherous mountains and into the rumored city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for both thrilling discovery and deadly peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions on this arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigation charts flickered on the bridge's holographic display, plotting a course through treacherous nebulae and uncharted wormholes. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the Xylos system, a perilous undertaking requiring precise piloting and nerves of steel.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger – the unknown, the unpredictable, and the silent, creeping threat of system failures light years from any rescue.
