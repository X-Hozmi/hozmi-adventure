A lone traveler, clad in leather armor and carrying a well-worn sword, trudged onward, his gaze fixed on the horizon.  He was bound for the distant city of Avalon, a legendary place whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each step was a test of his endurance, each hill a challenge to his will.
