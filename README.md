The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers both biological and geological.  Warp jumps were risky, navigation treacherous, and communication with Earth sporadic.  But the potential discovery of a new form of life, one that might hold the key to galactic survival, made the unimaginable journey worth the risk.
