
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zamora, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of Zamora's healing waters fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both danger and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission, far more ambitious than Elara's, was to chart unexplored nebulae in search of habitable planets.  While lacking the immediate, visceral dangers of medieval travel, the journey held a different kind of peril: the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the constant threat of navigational errors, and the alien landscapes that awaited them on far-off worlds.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, was both breathtaking and terrifying.
