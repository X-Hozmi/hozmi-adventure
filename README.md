
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's cart as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce provisions in isolated villages, and relying on the kindness (or cautionary indifference) of strangers.  Yet, the call of the sacred path, the allure of the unknown, pushes her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast emptiness of space is as treacherous as any medieval landscape; asteroid fields are deadly hazards, unforeseen gravitational anomalies can crush a starship, and the chilling solitude of the cosmos weighs on the crew.  But Eva, driven by a pioneering spirit not unlike Elara's, presses on, fueled by the hope of finding a new dawn for humankind amongst the celestial wonders.
