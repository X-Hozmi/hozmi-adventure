
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the hope of salvation fuels his journey, pushing him ever onward despite the hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding population.  The journey is fraught with the dangers of nebulae, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  Advanced technology mitigates some risks, but the sheer scale of space and the unknown nature of its inhabitants ensure that each jump to hyperspace holds a breathtaking, and potentially deadly, element of surprise.
