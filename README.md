
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her sweat-soaked skin.  Each creak of the saddle warned of the perilous journey ahead; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her quest to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  The vastness of the land stretched before her, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a small victory.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Kepler navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  He was on a mission to retrieve a rare element from the planet Kepler-186f, a journey fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The vastness of space, a limitless ocean of stars and possibilities, offered both immense reward and terrifying unknowns, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the infinite.
