
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked trails, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and resolve, but the lure of Zerzura, a glimmer of hope in the vast unknown, fueled his journey.  The camaraderie forged with his fellow travelers, bound together by shared hardship, became as valuable as any treasure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars became commonplace.  The crew, a diverse band united by a shared purpose, faced alien landscapes, strange phenomena, and the ever-present danger of malfunctioning technology and unknown spacefaring threats. But the hope of finding survivors, of discovering a new civilization, outweighed the risks, pushing them onward across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
