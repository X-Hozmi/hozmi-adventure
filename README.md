
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the only sound the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Avignon, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests where brigands lurked.  Each day brought new perils, from sudden storms to encounters with hostile locals, yet the unwavering glint in his eye spoke of a resolve forged in the fires of faith and duty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, rogue asteroids posed a constant threat, and the alien landscapes of distant planets held both breathtaking beauty and deadly secrets.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony and bring them back to the galactic federation, a journey demanding not only courage but also unwavering scientific precision and a healthy dose of luck against the overwhelming vastness of the cosmos.
