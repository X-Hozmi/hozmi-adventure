
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city, rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing king.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by the whispered legends of the Sunstone's brilliance, propelled him onward through the harsh realities of medieval travel, a relentless journey across kingdoms and through time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the aggressive K'tharr warships, Eva's crew faced the vast emptiness of space, the constant threat of equipment failure, and the unnerving silence punctuated only by the hum of the hyperdrive.  Their journey was a testament to human resilience and the unyielding pursuit of knowledge across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
