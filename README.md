
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on their backs.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the anxieties swirling within their hearts.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for a deadly plague sweeping across the land.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each stumble across rocky terrain, represented a step closer – or further from – salvation, a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the even more treacherous human element.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Starseeker*, through a nebula of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the cosmos, fueled their courage, propelling them onward into the vast, uncharted expanse of space.
