
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother – was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous passes tested her strength and the mule's endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of healing fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take years even at near-light speed.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, faced the cosmos with a steely gaze.  The fate of a lost civilization rested on her courage and skill, and she would not falter.
