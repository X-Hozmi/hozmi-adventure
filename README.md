
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone Monastery nestled high in the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains, was fraught with peril.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of the Sunstone, a relic said to grant unimaginable power, spurred them onward, their resolve hardening with every step.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek starship capable of traversing the vast gulf between galaxies.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien maps, Eva and her crew faced cosmic dangers unimaginable to their medieval predecessors.  The universe, a boundless ocean of possibility, held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns.
