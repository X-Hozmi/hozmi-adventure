
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights spurred their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Brigid from the clutches of a treacherous warlord rumored to dwell in the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, each sunset the grim reality of their perilous journey.


Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship thought to have vanished near the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms became commonplace during their interstellar voyage.  The vast emptiness of space held both incredible beauty and terrifying threats, pushing Elara and her crew to the limits of their endurance and ingenuity as they searched for a planet that might or might not even exist.
