
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He clutched the tattered map, its faded ink hinting at the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of both peril and reward.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself presented constant challenges, but the lure of the unknown fueled his relentless journey across the vast, untamed lands of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and wrestling with the unpredictable warp currents were just a few of the obstacles in her path. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, or oblivion, in equal measure.
