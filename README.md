
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  The King's writ, clutched tight in his saddlebag, promised riches and glory in the far east – a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: ravenous wolves, feuding lords, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of mythical cities and unimaginable wealth, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas clouds painting alien landscapes across her viewport.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown dangers both biological and technological.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the vastness of the cosmos, the potential for discovery and the ever-present risk of system failure, mirrored the trepidation and exhilaration of Thomas' medieval quest – a testament to the enduring human spirit's thirst for the unknown.
