
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Black Forest, a tapestry of shadows and whispering trees.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unknown lurked at every turn.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost Book of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril, but one he would undertake for the glory of his king and the salvation of his people.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of dying stars was routine, but the true adventure lay in the unknown.  The potential for discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the cosmos, fueled her every action.  This wasn't just a voyage; it was a leap into the vast, breathtaking, and utterly terrifying expanse of the galaxy.
