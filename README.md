
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swirling dust cloud against the ochre landscape, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown – the whispered warnings of bandits in the shadowed passes, the shimmering mirage of a distant oasis, the awe-inspiring sight of ancient ruins swallowed by the relentless sands.  Every night, huddled around a crackling fire, we shared stories of daring escapes and perilous encounters, our survival fueled by grit and the unwavering pursuit of our destination: the legendary city of Samarkand.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we leap across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from our own.  Beyond the viewport, nebulae blaze in impossible colours, swirling cosmic canvases of creation and destruction.  Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of space-time.  Our mission, to find a habitable planet for a dying Earth, is a quest of far greater magnitude than any medieval journey, yet the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burns just as fiercely in the hearts of the crew.
