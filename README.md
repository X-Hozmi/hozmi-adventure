
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each ford across a raging river, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of disease.  Yet, with every mile, the promise of a new life in the distant lands fueled her weary spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Jax's starship *Stardust* pierced the nebula, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  He gazed at the swirling cosmic canvas outside his viewport, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant galaxies. Their mission: to chart the unmapped edges of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a burgeoning human civilization. Though the dangers were different—vast distances, unpredictable celestial phenomena, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids—the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly as it had in Elara's heart centuries before.
