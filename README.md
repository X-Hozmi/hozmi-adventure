
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the war that had driven him from his village. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the ever-present threat of disease. This journey was a gamble, a desperate throw of the dice against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity, a refuge from the dying Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroid fields; communication with Earth, a tenuous thread stretching across light-years.  The vastness of space pressed in, a terrifying and breathtaking beauty that both exhilarated and threatened.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble with the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.
