
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the ever-present threat of war hung heavy in the air.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through her, but the burning desire to reach Jerusalem fuelled her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in the sleek lines of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the remote mining colony of Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a jarring experience, a kaleidoscope of swirling colours and impossible geometries, before spitting them out into the inky blackness punctuated by the distant glitter of uncountable stars. The dangers were different here – volatile space storms, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space, but the thrill of exploration, the siren call of the unknown, was just as potent as it had been for Elara so many centuries ago.
