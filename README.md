Below sprawled the rumored city of Eldoria, a shimmering jewel amidst a sea of verdant farmland, its spires catching the late afternoon sun.  His journey had been arduous, fraught with peril – bandits ambushed them in the Black Forest, a raging river nearly swallowed their horses whole, and dysentery plagued the party for weeks.
