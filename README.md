
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the challenges facing her, a lone woman seeking knowledge and a forgotten magic in a world shrouded in superstition and war. Each sunrise brought a new trial, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily occurrence, the vast emptiness of space a stark contrast to the teeming markets and vibrant cities he'd left behind.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive fueled his every decision, a lonely odyssey across the stars in search of a future he could barely comprehend.
