The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood – a grim reminder of the bandit raid only days past.

Though technology offered a shield against the harshest elements of space, the sheer vastness and unpredictability of the cosmos posed a constant, thrilling challenge.
