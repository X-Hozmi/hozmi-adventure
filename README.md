
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Reginald’s throat as he urged his weary mount across the parched plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating dense forests, fording raging rivers, and outwitting cunning lords who coveted his meager supplies.  The lure of Zerzura, however, fueled his relentless pursuit, even as despair threatened to extinguish his flickering hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining minerals to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The vast expanse of space, peppered with unpredictable asteroid fields and the ever-present risk of pirate attacks, presented a different kind of peril.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the loneliness of interstellar transit and the potential for catastrophic system failures tested her resolve. Yet, the knowledge that lives depended on her successful voyage propelled her forward, a lone star in the cosmic darkness.
