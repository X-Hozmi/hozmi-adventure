
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He carried a King's writ, a perilous commission to reach the distant Abbey of St. Jude, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship: skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and nights spent huddled beneath a sky ablaze with stars, a far cry from the comforting familiarity of his home.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, each sunset a renewed hope for the salvation his mission promised.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of revolutionizing intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the notorious K'tharr pirates, Eva and her crew faced dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the ethereal glow of distant galaxies, was both breathtaking and terrifying, a constant reminder of the immense scale of the universe and the fragility of their ship, their only link to a life beyond the stars.
