
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, spurred his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already claimed three packhorses and nearly a dozen men to dysentery and bandit ambushes.  Yet, the allure of the sacred city, whispered about in taverns and sung by bards, propelled them ever closer, each creaking wagon wheel a testament to their enduring grit against the relentless, unforgiving landscape.  Every sunrise promised new challenges, from treacherous mountain passes to the constant threat of human predators.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship painted with the nebulae of a thousand galaxies.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was less perilous than Reginald's, dangers residing not in bandits but in cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure in the unforgiving void of space.  But the allure of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, fueled the crew's unwavering determination as they hurtled through the inky blackness, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
