
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a tattered map, promising riches and adventure in the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit encounters, treacherous terrain, or the wonder of discovering a lost oasis.  The journey was a gamble, a test of endurance against the harsh realities of a medieval world, but the lure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, his starship leaping across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside painted a breathtaking canvas, a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the bridge.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a cluster of uncharted planets.  Facing unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of fuel depletion, the challenges were far removed from Elara's, but the human spirit of exploration, the irresistible draw of the unknown, remained the same.
