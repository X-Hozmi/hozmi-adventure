
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her on a perilous journey to find a rumored healer in a far-off monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – a fate she faced with a grit born of necessity and a stubborn refusal to fail.  The journey promised hardship, but the reward promised life itself.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  The hyperspace jump had left her crew disoriented but exhilarated; their destination, the Kepler-186f system, held the promise of a new beginning for a colony struggling against dwindling resources on old Earth.  The dangers weren't bandits or starvation, but gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of unexplored space.  The quest was for survival, for a future, a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
