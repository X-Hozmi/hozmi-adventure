
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward, their journey a testament to human resilience and the enduring power of legend.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates were commonplace hazards, but the true challenge lay in the vast, unpredictable expanse of the cosmos itself.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering unknown phenomena, making their journey not just a voyage across galaxies, but a gamble against the very fabric of space and time.
