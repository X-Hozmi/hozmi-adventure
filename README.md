Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was far from luxurious; rough roads tested both beast and rider, while the ever-present threat of bandits and unforeseen weather kept her nerves taut.  Each village offered a fleeting respite, a chance to replenish supplies and hear whispered tales of other travellers – knights errant, merchants laden with silks, and pilgrims seeking solace.  The unknown lay ahead, a tapestry woven with danger and the promise of untold riches or perhaps, only ruin.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by myth and rumour.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace; the true challenge was the temporal distortions near the Kepler system, a cosmic anomaly that warped time and space.  The vast, inky expanse of the galaxy held both terrifying wonders and breathtaking beauty, a constant reminder of the insignificant scale of human ambition against the sheer magnificence of the cosmos.
