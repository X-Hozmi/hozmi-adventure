
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, her resolve strengthens, fueled by the hope of a reunion and the thrill of the unknown that lies beyond the next horizon.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a fleeing human colony.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines of time, but each jump presents a unique danger – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling possibility of encountering unknown alien civilizations.  The vastness of space is a daunting and beautiful expanse, promising both unimaginable wonders and the very real threat of annihilation.
