
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a chaotic tapestry of creaking wagons and weary pack animals, crawls across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing worry of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present dust that coats everything, a fine grit clinging to hopes as stubbornly as it does to our skin. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon, fuels our relentless journey.  Whispers of its untold riches and ancient secrets propel us forward, despite the hardships, the hunger, and the ever-present shadow of death that stalks us across this unforgiving landscape.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive as it leaps across the void between galaxies.  Years melt into fleeting moments as we traverse the inky blackness, the constellations swirling into a dizzying ballet of light years away. Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking interstellar travel beyond even the Althea's capabilities.  The risks are unimaginable, the distances incomprehensible, but the promise of a new beginning, a new home for humanity amongst the stars, outweighs the fear of the unknown, the chilling emptiness of space, and the ever-present threat of celestial anomalies lying in wait.
