
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than the goal ahead: reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril – on this perilous journey across a vast and unforgiving land.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages offered fleeting comfort, punctuating a landscape both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of apprehension.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble to reach the rumored Eden planet, a world said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers was child's play compared to the unknown physics of hyperspace.  But the chance to rewrite galactic history, to end the endless wars, spurred her on, a siren song in the vast, star-strewn void.
