
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting whisper against her worn leather jerkin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with the kindness of strangers, the fear of the unknown, and the unwavering hope that fueled her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy teeming with unexplored planets.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, inky blackness.  Unlike the medieval adventurer's reliance on instinct and map, Eva navigated by starlight and complex algorithms, yet the thrill of discovery remained the same.  The unknown still lurked – in the form of hostile alien life, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – but the lure of the cosmos burned brighter than any earthly ambition.
