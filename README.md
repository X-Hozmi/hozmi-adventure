
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in stolen artifacts, a secret map promising untold riches, and the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of the Black Death.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential harbinger of adventure, or disaster.  The road ahead, a ribbon of ochre stretching to the horizon, held both unimaginable treasures and perilous unknowns.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating by constellations unknown to Earth-bound eyes, Ryla and her crew charted a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space was a different kind of desert, one filled not with sand, but with cosmic rays and the chilling possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, offering the promise of unimaginable discoveries – and the very real threat of annihilation.
