
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack mules and weary men, snaked its way across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the unease in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or the far more terrifying reality of the plague that stalked the land.  Our quest – to reach the fabled city of Samarkand and secure a shipment of rare spices – felt more a fool's errand with each passing day, the vast, unforgiving landscape a constant reminder of our own fragility.

Centuries later, the stars were our only map.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of generations, leaped across the void between galaxies.  While the danger was different—plasma storms that threatened to incinerate the hull, the chilling emptiness of hyperspace, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the thrill of exploration remained. Each jump to a new system brought the promise of discovery, the potential to uncover new worlds teeming with life, or to face the cold reality of a dead planet, a silent testament to the universe's indifference. The vastness of space, however, was a constant companion, equally awe-inspiring and terrifying.
