
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a haphazard collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaks across the dusty plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, unpredictable weather, and the gnawing uncertainty of reaching our destination – the fabled city of Carcassonne.  We barter for supplies in ramshackle villages, sharing stories around crackling fires under the vast, indifferent stars, our journey a tapestry woven with danger, camaraderie, and the ever-present hope of discovery.


Centuries later, the *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel capable of folding space itself, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos cluster, a region brimming with uncharted planets and potentially hostile alien life.  The crew, a multinational team of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and hardened explorers, face the cosmic unknown with a blend of scientific curiosity and cautious apprehension.  The vast distances and unpredictable nature of interstellar travel make every jump a gamble, but the allure of the unexplored is a siren song none can resist.
