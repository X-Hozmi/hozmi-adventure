
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary oxen, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress towards the mythical city of Samarkand.  Each day brings new peril: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the East, whispered in tales of unimaginable riches and powerful magic, fuels our onward journey, a desperate gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hums a low song as it leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Ahead lies Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  But the galaxy is a dangerous place, teeming with pirates, warring factions, and cosmic anomalies that threaten to shatter our vessel and leave us adrift in the endless black.  The vastness of space holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, each jump a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
