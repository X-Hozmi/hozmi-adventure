
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees mountains, then the endless expanse of the Iberian Peninsula, a tapestry of sun-drenched plains and unforgiving deserts.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, unforgiving terrain testing our mounts and our resolve, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred us onward, a flickering flame in the vast darkness.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our guide.  The sleek Althea cuts through the inky blackness of space, its engines humming a low, steady song. Our destination: Xylos, a planet teeming with life unlike anything we've encountered.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith across the vast cosmic ocean.  We navigate asteroid fields, dodge the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and brace ourselves for the unpredictable whims of wormholes.  The risks are immense, but the promise of discovery – of new species, new technologies, new worlds – is a siren's call too powerful to resist.
