
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her horse onward.  The journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in taverns, had been arduous.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger were but small price to pay for the rumored healing waters promised within its walls. Each creak of her saddle, each weary sigh of her mount, marked another step closer to the unknown, a testament to the relentless pull of adventure in a time of knights, kings, and whispered legends.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting vibration against the vast, inky blackness.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a tapestry of nebulae and uncharted worlds teeming with possibilities, and perhaps, dangers.  The risk of encountering unknown alien civilizations, the perils of navigating unstable wormholes – these were challenges gladly accepted by this intrepid explorer, driven by the same human spirit of adventure that propelled Elara across the medieval world centuries before.
