
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing the perilous route to Constantinople.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the hardships he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, the promise of untold riches and exotic wonders, spurred him on, a relentless whisper against the howling wind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure her mission.  But the potential reward – unlocking interstellar travel for humanity – outweighed every risk.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space stretched before her, a breathtaking testament to humanity's boundless ambition.
