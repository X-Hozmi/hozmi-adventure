
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of discovery, spurred him relentlessly across the vast and unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him not just a map, but a hope as boundless as the horizon itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable gravitational fields, asteroid showers, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life.  But the vastness of space held a unique allure, a challenge to human ingenuity and courage.  Each new planet offered the chance to rewrite history, to expand the boundaries of human knowledge and perhaps, find a new home amongst the stars.
