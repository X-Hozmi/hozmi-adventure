
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the swirling anxieties in our hearts.  We've faced bandits, forded raging rivers, and endured the blistering heat, driven by the promise of silks and spices in the far-off markets of Constantinople. Each creak of the wagon wheels, each groan of a weary camel, marks another step closer to – or further from – fortune and glory, a constant gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving whims of fate.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship forged from alloys unknown to medieval minds, cuts a silent path through the void between nebulae.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable worlds and lost alien civilizations.  The vastness of space is a different kind of unforgiving – the cold, the radiation, the ever-present threat of unforeseen celestial phenomena. Yet, the potential rewards, the discovery of new life, the expansion of human knowledge, are a siren song that pulls us ever onward into the cosmic unknown.
