
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every sunset.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whisper of untold riches and forbidden knowledge, spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr cruisers was commonplace.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling gas and distant starlight, held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying danger. Yet, fueled by the promise of discovery and the insatiable human thirst for exploration, Comet pressed on, a lone voyager charting a course into the unmapped reaches of the cosmos.
