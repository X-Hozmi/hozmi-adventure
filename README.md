
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already tested their endurance.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the relentless sun beat down upon them during the long days. Each ford across a swollen river, each night spent under a canvas awning, was a small victory in their grand adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the ever-present hope of reaching their sacred destination.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of uncharted planets was commonplace.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route connecting the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The vastness of space held both terrifying unknowns and breathtaking beauty, a constant challenge for a crew driven by the boundless curiosity of humanity's endless quest to explore the cosmos.
