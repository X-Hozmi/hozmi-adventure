
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a restless spirit.  Before her lay the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Duchy of Aquitaine, a tapestry woven with sun-baked fields, ancient forests whispered with rumour, and the ever-present threat of banditry.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, transforming a simple journey into a perilous adventure, a test of her resilience against the harsh beauty of the medieval world. Her destination: a rumored monastery holding an ancient map promising untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, a world veiled in mystery and possibility.  The journey had already claimed weeks, tested their supplies, and strained the crew’s patience, but the promise of a new beginning, a chance to break free from the overpopulated cradle of Earth, fueled their tireless efforts.  The vastness of the cosmos held both wonder and terror, but Ryla gripped the controls, her heart pounding with the thrill of intergalactic exploration.
