
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the fractured landscape of war-torn France was perilous, each day a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  She carried a small, precious map, a promise of sanctuary in a distant monastery, a journey fueled by hope and the unwavering spirit of survival.  The rough trails, the shared campfires with wary strangers, the chilling nights spent under a vast, indifferent sky – all etched themselves into the tapestry of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos cluster, a region teeming with uncharted planets and the potential for both breathtaking discovery and unimaginable peril.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The vibrant nebulae, the strange, alien landscapes of the planets they explored, the constant threat of rogue asteroid fields – these were the hazards of her galactic quest, a journey fuelled by scientific curiosity and the boundless human desire to explore the vast, mysterious universe.
