
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the rutted track.  Her caravan, a patchwork of weary animals and even wearier humans, snaked its way across the unforgiving terrain.  Rumours of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and guarded by dragons, fueled their perilous journey eastward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every hardship overcome, Elara’s resolve hardened, the whispered legends a beacon in the harsh reality of their adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Ryker' Valerian piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and silent planets, both awed and terrified him.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and encounters with unknown alien lifeforms were daily occurrences.  But the possibility of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of Kepler-186f, spurred Ryker onwards, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
