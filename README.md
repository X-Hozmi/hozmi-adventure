
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death already creeping across Europe.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Calais, a journey fraught with peril, where every sunset brought a fresh wave of uncertainty and the chilling breath of winter.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the Andromeda Galaxy. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space pirates of the K'tharr Hegemony, Eva and her crew faced a cosmic odyssey far removed from the medieval knight's earthly struggles, but no less perilous in its own right. The universe was their battlefield, its silent expanse teeming with both wonder and unimaginable danger.
