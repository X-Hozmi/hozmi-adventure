
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of faraway lands: the shimmering silks of the East, the rumored gold mines of the south, and the mysterious cities hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rise and fall of the land, fueled his restless spirit, a pilgrimage to the unknown fuelled by ambition and a yearning for something more than the drudgery of his village.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness of intergalactic space.  Captain Eva Rostova gazed at the swirling nebula outside her viewport, a kaleidoscope of colour and cosmic dust light-years from Earth.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human civilisation.  The weight of responsibility rested heavy, but the thrill of discovery – the potential to uncover new life, new technologies, new worlds – eclipsed any fear.  The vastness of space was a terrifying and exhilarating canvas for her bold explorations.
