
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the twilight, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests teeming with bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brought new challenges, a constant test of endurance and courage against the unpredictable landscape and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  The promise of divine grace, however, spurred them onwards, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving expanse of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant dance with gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields, demanding split-second reactions and unwavering focus.  The thrill of exploration, the breathtaking beauty of cosmic wonders, and the potential discovery of new life fueled her crew's tireless efforts.  The vastness of space held both immense danger and unparalleled reward, a stark contrast to the limited horizons of their terrestrial ancestors.
