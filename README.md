Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the fog of his imagination, kept him pushing forward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xantus artifact, a device rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers, she pushed her vessel to its limits, the vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy both terrifying and awe-inspiring.  The rewards – a technological leap for humanity – were worth the immeasurable risks, even if the journey tested her courage and skill like nothing before.
