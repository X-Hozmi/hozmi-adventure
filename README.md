
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the devastating plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease – that lay between her and her destination.  This was no mere journey; it was a desperate gamble against fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant suns, held a different kind of fear – the chilling emptiness, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential to rewrite history, fueled her unwavering determination.
