
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on their journey across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the treacherous Baron Maldor.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of glory, pushed him further, spurred on by the hope of returning a hero to his kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space held dangers beyond human comprehension, but the allure of discovery, the potential for unlocking unimaginable technological advancements, fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination, no matter the cost.
