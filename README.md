
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties meant to bolster the meagre harvests of a distant monastery.  Bandits, scorching sun, and treacherous mountain passes were constant threats, but the whispered legends of hidden springs and the promise of bountiful harvests fuelled her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential adventure, a test of her resilience and faith.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast, unknowable expanse held both terrifying beauty and immense danger;  uncharted gravitational fields, rogue asteroids, and the potential for encountering alien civilizations added a thrilling, unpredictable edge to her journey.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a testament to human courage and ingenuity.
