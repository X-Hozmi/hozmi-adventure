
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each crest scaled, each river forded, brought them closer to the unknown – bandits, wild beasts, and treacherous terrain all stood between her and salvation.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the indomitable human spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable worlds for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms were commonplace hazards, but the thrill of discovery, the sheer scale of the cosmos, fueled her and her crew.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble with fate, but the promise of a new beginning propelled them forward, across the unimaginable distances between the stars.
