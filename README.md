
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless; days bled into weeks, marked only by the shifting landscapes – dense forests giving way to sun-baked hills, the constant threat of bandits a shadow clinging to their heels.  Each sunrise brought a renewed hope of reaching their destination, a testament to the unwavering faith fueling their arduous trek across the medieval world.  Every stumble of the mule, every ache in his bones, only served to amplify the thrill of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out the viewport of her starship, the swirling nebula of Xylos painting the blackness with vibrant hues.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey that dwarfed even the wildest medieval expeditions in scale.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reminder of the staggering technological might allowing her to traverse interstellar distances.  Yet, the sense of adventure, the thrill of discovery facing uncharted territories filled with the potential of new life and breathtaking wonders, felt strikingly familiar to the tales of her ancestors’ medieval voyages.
