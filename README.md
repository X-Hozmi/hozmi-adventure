
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers must be forded, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of endurance for the knight and his small band of companions. Their journey is a tapestry woven with peril and the promise of glory, a classic medieval adventure etched against a backdrop of unforgiving landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for a dying colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps take her across unimaginable distances, past shimmering alien planets and through asteroid fields teeming with danger.  Communication with Earth is sporadic, and the vastness of space amplifies the feeling of isolation. But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a crew of loyal companions, presses onward, fueled by the knowledge that billions of lives depend on her success – a futuristic adventure unfolding amongst the breathtaking wonders and terrifying unknowns of the cosmos.
