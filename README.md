
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the wind.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, fuelled by sibling love, spurred her onward, a tiny spark against the vast, indifferent wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the planet Kepler-186f, a jewel hidden amongst a tapestry of swirling nebulas and uncharted star systems.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic engine failure, while pirate raids and unpredictable asteroid fields were constant threats.  But the call of exploration, the promise of discovery and the potential to reunite a scattered people, propelled her forward through the inky black, a tiny vessel against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
