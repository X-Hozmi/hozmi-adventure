
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling village and a tyrannical lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – or disaster. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on this perilous journey across the kingdoms, a journey fueled by a fierce will to survive.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the grasp of rogue gravitational wells was a daily challenge.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  With a crew of hardened explorers and advanced technology at her command, she faced the vastness of space with a mix of excitement and apprehension, the weight of galactic destiny resting on her shoulders.
