
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a worn map depicting a barely-legible route to the rumored city of Eldoria, and the hope of finding her missing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down her spine, a reminder of the dangers lurking in this wild, untamed world – bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, fueled her onward.

Centuries later,  Captain Jaxx navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a low, steady thrum.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet teeming with bioluminescent flora and hostile, insectoid creatures.  The vastness of space held its own perils - rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the potential reward – a power source that could solve Earth's energy crisis – outweighed the risks, spurring Jaxx and her crew to push the boundaries of known space, braving the unknown for the sake of humanity's future.
