
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the rutted track, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The journey across the King's Road was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges and landscapes, a tapestry woven with both hardship and breathtaking beauty.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle of a thousand dying stars.  Interplanetary travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of the cosmos still held a humbling power.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through unmapped territories, a risky gamble with potentially devastating rewards.  The thrill of discovery, the chilling silence of space, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown alien lifeforms made each jump through the void an exhilarating, terrifying adventure.
