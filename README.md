
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped securely behind him – a tempting prize for the bandits that plagued the King's Road.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.  He was alone, save for his loyal but aging hound, relying on his wits and the worn map clutched in his frost-bitten hand to navigate the treacherous landscape and reach the fortified city of Aethelburg before nightfall.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril; unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure loomed large.  But the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the cosmos and expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy – was a powerful motivator, pushing her and her crew relentlessly towards the unknown.
