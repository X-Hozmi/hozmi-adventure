
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless wheat fields in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of King Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  But the whispers of Zerzura, of unimaginable riches and ancient power, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Companions had fallen, supplies dwindled, yet the lure of the unknown kept him pushing onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the rumored Xylossian Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy said to be hidden on a previously uncharted planet within the nebula's heart.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll, a hostile insectoid race, tested her skills to their limits.  Faster-than-light jumps were risky, and the loneliness of space, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of her comms, was a constant companion. Yet, the potential reward, the chance to reshape galactic power, spurred her on through the endless void.
