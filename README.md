
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, suspicious villagers, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  But the whispered tales of Eldoria's healing waters fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a desperate humanity.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the routine.  But the possibility of finding a new Eden, a planet teeming with life and potential, spurred her on, her heart filled with a hope as boundless as the cosmos itself.
