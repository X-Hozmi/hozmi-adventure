
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised autumn sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or the chilling threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements.  Survival itself was a quest, a constant negotiation with a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula shimmering with colours unseen on Earth. His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Sol.  The journey was a symphony of warp drives and hyperspace jumps, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the ever-present hum of the ship's engines.  The cosmos offered boundless wonder – alien landscapes, strange new lifeforms – but also held the peril of rogue asteroids, hostile space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of traversing the infinite expanse of the galaxy.
