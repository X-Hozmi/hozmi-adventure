
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward. The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine, not from the chill autumn air, but from the whispered tales of brigands and mythical beasts that haunted these woods.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  The journey was fraught with peril – treacherous terrain, hostile encounters, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the hope of salvation spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, a decades-long odyssey, tested the crew's resilience as they navigated asteroid fields, repaired damaged warp drives, and weathered cosmic storms.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Reginald's medieval trek, the vastness of space presented a different kind of terror: the isolating loneliness of the void, the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel, and the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown.
