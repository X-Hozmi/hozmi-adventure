
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Tuscan landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's future, a desperate journey to escape the encroaching plague and find a rumored haven across the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, but the hope of a new beginning spurred her onward through the darkening forests and across treacherous mountain passes.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the vastness of the cosmos a constant reminder of their vulnerability.  But the promise of a unified galaxy, free from the endless cycle of interplanetary conflict, fueled her courage and pushed her ever further into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
