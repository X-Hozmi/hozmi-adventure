
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal landscape in hues of blood orange and amethyst.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the cure for her brother’s plague.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere obstacles in her determined stride; each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueling her journey across a vast and unforgiving land.  The whispers of adventure were a siren song, promising both peril and the potential for salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with the possibility of life.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were just part of the routine for a seasoned galactic courier.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, was a constant companion, a reminder of both the fragility and the infinite potential of existence.
