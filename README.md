
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward. The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through him, a constant reminder of the dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the unknown – that lurked in the shadows of his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of cosmic dust and distant galaxies unfolding outside her viewport.  The journey was fraught with peril; asteroid fields, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure were just some of the challenges she faced in her quest to find a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
