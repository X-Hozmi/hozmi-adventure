The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, a stark contrast to the biting winds he'd endured crossing the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone hidden in the forgotten kingdom of Eldoria, had tested him to his limits.

Though faster than any medieval trek, the interstellar voyage demanded a different kind of resilience, a constant vigilance against the unpredictable dangers of space and the loneliness of the void.
