
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a jagged silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of a forgotten monastery nestled somewhere in the Spanish plains.  Each creak of the saddle, each chilling wind, fueled the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the perilous beauty of medieval travel – a journey measured not in miles, but in the resilience of spirit and the kindness (or cruelty) of strangers encountered along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The shimmering gas clouds painted vibrant hues across the viewport, a breathtaking spectacle that belied the daunting task ahead: traversing the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a promise of faster-than-light travel, but the potential for encountering unmapped gravitational anomalies or hostile alien civilizations kept her nerves taut.  Exploration of the cosmos was a far cry from medieval treks, but the spirit of adventure, that relentless pull towards the unknown, remained unchanged.
