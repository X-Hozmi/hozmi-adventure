
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Gareth, his armour gleaming dully beneath the harsh sun, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-infested forests, and across rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, the threat of disease, and the ever-present hunger gnawing at his belly.  Yet, the thought of fulfilling his duty, of playing a part in the larger tapestry of his kingdom, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull shimmering under the violet light of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of explored space, a journey spanning lightyears and unimaginable cosmic distances.  Facing the perils of nebulae, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown space anomalies, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held dangers far beyond anything a medieval knight could comprehend; yet, like Gareth, she pressed on, driven by a sense of purpose and the hope of a successful return.
