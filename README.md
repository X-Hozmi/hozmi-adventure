
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a few healing herbs, and the map – a faded parchment promising riches and adventure in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain, but the whisper of buried treasure and the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward.  The unknown held promise, and the road, however treacherous, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rell stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate fleets were merely Tuesday for Razor, but the allure of unlocking interstellar shortcuts – of charting new routes through unmapped galaxies – kept his heart pounding.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring ocean of stars, held the greatest adventure of all.
