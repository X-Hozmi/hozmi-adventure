
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track winding through the unforgiving French countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to the air.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his weary body and emboldened his spirit for this arduous, medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and corporate espionage threatening her mission.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held dangers far beyond anything Reginald could have imagined, but Eva, armed with advanced technology and unwavering determination, pressed on, her journey a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery in the far reaches of the cosmos.
