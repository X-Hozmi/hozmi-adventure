
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – navigating murky forests, bartering with suspicious villagers, and outwitting the relentless patrols of a rival kingdom.  His only companions are his loyal sword, his dwindling supplies, and the unwavering hope of reaching his destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate a legendary lost colony rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering cryptic alien signals are all in a day's work.  The loneliness of interstellar space is a constant companion, but the thrill of discovery and the promise of a new era for humanity fuel her unwavering determination.
