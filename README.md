
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel and rustle in the scrubland brought the possibility of bandits, starvation, or worse. Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast, indifferent darkness of the medieval world.  She would face any peril, endure any hardship, for her brother's life.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant cosmic tapestry woven from gas and stardust. His mission: a perilous cargo run across multiple galaxies, carrying vital bio-engineered seeds to a colony struggling for survival on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the tentacles of space pirates was routine, the vastness of space both beautiful and terrifying. Each jump through hyperspace held the promise of fortune, or the cold, silent oblivion of the void.  The galaxy was his playground, a canvas painted in the breathtaking colors of nebulae and the deadly darkness of unknown threats.
