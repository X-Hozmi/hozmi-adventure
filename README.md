
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown stretched before her like the endless horizon.  Survival depended not only on her strength but her wit, her ability to navigate by the stars and to trust the kindness – or at least the indifference – of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The void between stars was a silent, indifferent ocean, filled with the potential for pirates, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling emptiness of space.  Success hung on the delicate balance of hyperdrive calculations, the reliability of her aging ship, and the unwavering courage of her crew, facing not just the vastness of space, but the crushing weight of loneliness in the face of unimaginable distances.
