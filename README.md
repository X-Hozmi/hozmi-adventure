The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village he’d just fled.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery on the far side of the Black Forest, a sanctuary said to hold the cure.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease. His journey was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice against fate itself.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek starship slicing through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  The vastness of space, speckled with glittering constellations and the ghostly echoes of dead stars, held both awe and danger.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and deciphering ancient alien technology were just a few of the challenges awaiting her crew. The survival of a forgotten people rested on their shoulders, a weight as heavy as the cosmos itself.
