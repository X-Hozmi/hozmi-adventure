
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plains stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from the plague-ridden village she'd left behind.  Each creak of the saddle, each howl of the wind, was a challenge, a testament to the relentless struggle for survival that defined travel in this era. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort, a stark contrast to the breathtaking, alien beauty surrounding him.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself – the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, remained a timeless constant that echoed the spirit of Elara's medieval trek across continents.
