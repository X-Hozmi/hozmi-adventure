
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the oppressive heat of the French countryside.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very landscape itself, unforgiving and vast, threatened to swallow him whole. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the grim reality of his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The vast emptiness of space, peppered with glittering stars and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, tested her skills and courage.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own unique dangers, and the potential for navigational errors or engine malfunctions loomed large. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, fueled her onward, a modern-day knight errant charting a course across the cosmos.
