
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the parched earth, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling campfires, was proving more arduous than any tale had prepared her for.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve at every turn, yet the lure of Zerzura, and the untold riches and knowledge it promised, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new obstacle to overcome.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking, yet terrifying, panorama.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and enduring the psychological strain of months spent light-years from home demanded unwavering courage and precision.  The potential rewards, however, outweighed the risks – a new era of galactic exploration lay within reach.
