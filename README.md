
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of apprehension.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the trials that lay between him and his desperate hope.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: a deep-space survey for habitable planets, a vital step in humanity's interstellar expansion.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glow of nebulae and the silent hum of the ship's engines, held its own brand of terror.  Cosmic radiation, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms made this journey as perilous, in its own way, as any medieval knight's perilous trek across the land.
