
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill autumn wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape of the English Midlands, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards promised in his whispered tales of the crusades.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the growing unease.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked him, a constant reminder of the perilous nature of his journey across the land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith, ambition, and a desperate yearning for something more than the life he knew.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was the only sound louder than the frantic thump of Captain Eva Rostova's heart.  Navigating the treacherous Xylos Nebula, a swirling chaos of cosmic dust and radiation, was a gamble, but the potential rewards – a legendary artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – were too enticing to ignore.  Eva, her crew a motley assortment of hardened explorers and hopeful dreamers, gripped the controls, their journey a high-stakes dance with oblivion, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of the unknown across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
