Rumors of a lost city, overflowing with gold and ancient magic, fueled his journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the thrilling, terrifying gamble.
