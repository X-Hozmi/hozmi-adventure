
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent of pack mules and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brings the threat of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fuels our relentless march.  We face scorching deserts, icy mountain passes, and the constant shadow of disease, but the promise of adventure, of discovering what lies beyond the horizon, keeps our spirits – barely – afloat.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship the size of a small city, cuts through the inky void, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light years from Earth.  We navigate asteroid fields that shimmer like celestial jewels, dodge rogue black holes that threaten to swallow us whole, and endure the relentless monotony of hyperspace.  But the quest to discover new worlds, to expand the boundaries of human knowledge and experience, is a siren song that pulls us ever onward, promising unimaginable wonders and the thrilling risk of the unknown.
