Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from Constantinople to Damascus.  His journey had already taken him through sun-baked deserts, across treacherous mountain passes patrolled by bandits, and into the shadowed depths of ancient forests.

Her crew, a motley band of xeno-biologists and astrophysicists, held their breath, anticipating the challenges and wonders that awaited them in a galaxy far, far away.  The unknown stretched before them, a vast and breathtaking expanse ripe with discovery and danger.
