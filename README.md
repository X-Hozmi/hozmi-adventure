
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map promising untold riches in the far east, bounced against his back.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, sharpened his senses, reminding him of the perils – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation – that lay between him and his destiny.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance and will, but the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of exotic lands and unimaginable wealth, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Thomas's medieval trek, Eva faced perils of a different kind – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving vastness of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to chart new worlds and expand human knowledge, propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the cosmic sea.
