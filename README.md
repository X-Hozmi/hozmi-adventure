
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseilles, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun tunics.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Pyrenees, then through the sun-baked plains of Castile, dodging bandits and navigating treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – a ford swollen by recent rains, a hostile lord demanding tribute, the ever-present threat of disease. But with every league traversed, our resolve hardened, fueled by the whispered tales of faraway lands and the unwavering camaraderie forged on this arduous path.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormhole currents, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Each jump across the star-strewn canvas was a leap into the unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and the unquenchable thirst for discovery.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a promise far exceeding anything the medieval world could offer.
