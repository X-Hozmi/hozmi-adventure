Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience.  But the whispered promises of Eldoria – a city of shimmering spires and untold riches – fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy storms, Eva faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Yet, the vastness of space held a similar allure: the promise of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, a yearning to push beyond the boundaries of the known universe, fueling her journey among the stars.
