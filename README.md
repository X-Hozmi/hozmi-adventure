
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with its own challenges – unpredictable wormholes, solar flares threatening to fry the ship's systems, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel. But the allure of discovering new worlds, charting unmapped galaxies, and potentially finding life beyond Earth far outweighed the risks for this intrepid explorer.
