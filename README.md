He pressed on, fueled by a stubborn hope and the whispers of legend.


Thousands of light years from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.

But the journey wasn't without peril; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets loomed large in the vast emptiness of space.  The allure of discovery, however, outweighed the risks, drawing them ever closer to the unknown wonders that lay beyond the stars.
