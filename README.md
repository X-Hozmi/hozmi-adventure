
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a chipped map, its directions barely legible after weeks of relentless travel.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, was a reminder of her perilous journey eastward, a quest to reach the legendary Silk Road markets, a gamble fueled by whispered tales of unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable dangers.  Bandits, harsh winters, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a leap of faith across vast interstellar distances. Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned spacers, relied on her expertise to navigate the treacherous currents of space, their mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  The thrill of exploration, however, was tempered by the ever-present danger – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the gnawing isolation of the cosmos.
