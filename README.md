
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a chance to escape the shadow of a vengeful Baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and unexpected discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey east, a pilgrimage fueled by desperation and a fierce will to survive.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of her starship's engines a stark contrast to the vibrant cosmic tapestry surrounding her.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, a whisper of a civilization swallowed by the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  With hyperdrive engaged, she leaped across light-years, dodging asteroid fields and the occasional pirate squadron, her journey a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge across the unforgiving void.
