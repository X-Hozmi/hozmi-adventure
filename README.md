
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or the insidious bite of plague. Yet, the promise of Constantinople, a city of shimmering domes and untold riches, fuels our relentless journey. The unknown dangers are dwarfed by the allure of the legendary Silk Road, a path paved with both peril and possibility.


Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek, silver vessel, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes that warp spacetime is routine for Captain Eva Rostova and her seasoned crew.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets, a quest far more perilous than any medieval journey, yet propelled by the same human drive – the insatiable thirst for discovery and the courageous pursuit of what lies beyond the known.
