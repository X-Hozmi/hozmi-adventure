
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, her mule struggling under the weight of their meager supplies.  Rumors of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and rumored to hold the secrets of the ancients, spurred her onward.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled her relentless pursuit.  Every sunrise brought the promise of new sights, new dangers, and the unwavering hope of discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f system.  The vast emptiness of space was punctuated by the ethereal beauty of celestial bodies, each a potential hazard or a breathtaking marvel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space debris was a constant test of skill, while the loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at the crew's resolve.  But the promise of finding habitable worlds, of charting new territories in the unmapped galaxies, pushed them ever forward, making the dangers and discomforts pale in comparison to the boundless potential awaiting them beyond the stars.
