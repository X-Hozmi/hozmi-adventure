
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford icy rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts a constant companion.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – a crumbling bridge, a sudden storm, or the lurking suspicion of a rival caravan.  Our journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Zerzura, is a test of endurance, resourcefulness, and unwavering hope.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The sleek starship *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the grandeur of a nebula.  Our mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, seeking habitable worlds for a burgeoning human civilization.  We jump between star systems, braving asteroid fields and navigating gravitational anomalies, the vast emptiness of space both beautiful and terrifying. The thrill of discovery, the potential for finding new life, fuels our intrepid journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
