
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s small caravan struggled onward.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a testament to the relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and rumors of plague-ridden villages spurred them onward.  Their destination: the fabled city of Samarkand, a whisper of silks and spices, a promise of unimaginable wealth – or certain ruin.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of precarious hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a deep, resonant song.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Arm of Orion, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Alien storms raged, gravity wells threatened to crush their vessel, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, hostile species loomed large.  But the allure of discovery, the siren call of the unknown, pushed them further into the cosmic void, each jump a gamble, each star a potential grave or a gateway to breathtaking new worlds.
