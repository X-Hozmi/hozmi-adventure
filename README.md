
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cart piled high with meager supplies our only companion beside the ever-present fear of bandits and disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers demanding perilous crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. We bartered with suspicious villagers, slept under a sky ablaze with unfamiliar stars, and tasted the bitter sweetness of freedom amidst the constant peril.  The whispered legends of the Silk Road, a path of both unimaginable wealth and unimaginable danger, fueled our weary steps.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship groaning under the weight of its centuries-long voyage, is our home.  We, the children of those who dared to cross the gulf between galaxies, navigate asteroid fields and navigate the treacherous currents of spacetime.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a pale blue dot promising a new beginning, a new Eden—but one guarded by untold dangers and mysteries that await us on alien soil.
