
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, fording raging rivers swollen by spring rains, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, spurred her onward.  The scent of pine and the distant cry of a hawk were small comforts against the vast, unforgiving landscape, but they fueled her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though vastly different from Elara's, held the same sense of perilous adventure.  Instead of bandits, he faced asteroid fields and solar flares; instead of rivers, he navigated cosmic currents.  But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories and potentially finding new life, was a beacon guiding him through the inky blackness of space.
