
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadows, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, a relic said to hold unimaginable power, spurred him on.  Each creak of the saddle, each crunch of gravel under his steed’s hooves, marked another step closer to his destiny, or perhaps, his doom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Cosmic rays bombarded the hull, and the constant threat of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational forces kept her crew on edge.  But the potential rewards – interstellar exploration and the unlocking of the universe’s deepest secrets – far outweighed the risks.
