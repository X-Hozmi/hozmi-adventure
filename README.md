
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, yet the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred him ever onwards, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe. Each creak of his saddle, each splash through a stream, marked another step towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking vistas of celestial wonders, but also the chilling emptiness of space, and the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unknown alien entities.  The vastness of the cosmos was both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a gamble with the very fabric of existence itself.
