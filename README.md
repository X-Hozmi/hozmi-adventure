
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving peaks of the Pyrenees.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril – in equal measure. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were companions on this arduous journey across the known world.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the long-abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star lightyears from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day’s work for this seasoned interstellar explorer.  The vastness of space held endless possibilities, but also terrifying unknowns, as Eva pushed the boundaries of human exploration across the galaxy.
