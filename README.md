
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient texts and untold riches, had drawn her from her village, a perilous journey across unforgiving landscapes and through bandit-infested forests. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of potential discovery, or the chilling whisper of danger.  The journey was as much a test of her spirit as her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The hyperspace jump had been turbulent, throwing her crew against the safety restraints, but the thrill of charting unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy outweighed any risk.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life forms unlike any encountered before, a prize worthy of the immense distances and the perilous cosmic storms they had braved.  The universe was their playground, and exploration their lifeblood.
