
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a few dried figs, a worn map stained with mud and sweat, and the hope of reaching her brother in Avignon before winter's icy grip claimed the land.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the lure of reunion spurred her onward, the rough-hewn path her only guide across the medieval tapestry of kingdoms and conflict.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while the vast emptiness between stars held unseen dangers.  But Eva, hardened by years of exploration, pressed on, driven by the same human spirit that had propelled Elara across the medieval world – a thirst for discovery and the unwavering hope of finding something extraordinary beyond the known.
