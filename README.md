
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, fuelled her onward, each hardship a step closer to her destiny.  She carried with her only a worn map, a trusty sword, and a heart filled with unwavering courage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate raiders was commonplace; the real challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic transmissions from the vanished colony.  With a seasoned crew and advanced technology at her disposal, Ryla knew the odds were stacked in her favor, but the vastness of space, and the unknowns it held, still instilled a healthy dose of fear and excitement in her experienced heart.
