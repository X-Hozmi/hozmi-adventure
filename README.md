
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance.  Her journey had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the promise of the papal court, and the chance to find her long-lost brother, fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and a new test of her courage and resilience.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand was her only guide through the unpredictable terrain of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Jackson piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey stretched across light years, demanding constant vigilance against rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships.  Jax, however, was not deterred; the vast expanse of space was his playground, and the mysteries it held, his irresistible calling.
