
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown hedgerows, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria, and the desperate hope in his heart, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The journey spanned lightyears, fraught with the perils of asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  But the potential for rediscovering a lost civilization, and the unwavering belief in her crew's skills, propelled Elara towards the unknown, a galaxy far, far away.
