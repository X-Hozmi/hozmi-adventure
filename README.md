
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing all she owned.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death barely registered against the thrill of her journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Each creak of the saddle, each shared campfire with weary travelers, each breathtaking vista, fueled her spirit. This was no mere journey; it was a quest for redemption, a test of faith and endurance, a chapter etched into the vibrant tapestry of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours painting the viewport.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The dangers were not bandits or plague, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  Yet, the vastness, the unknown, and the potential for discovery sparked a fire in her heart, a hunger for the unimaginable only interstellar travel could satisfy.
