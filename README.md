
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track snaked through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Eldoria, seeking an alliance against the encroaching Saracen hordes.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were as perilous as any enemy army.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, but the glory of success, and the survival of his kingdom, fueled his weary steps.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, the warp drive sputtering under the strain of the unstable spacetime currents.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Terran Federation and the newly discovered Xylossian civilization.  Asteroids, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile species made the interstellar voyage a constant battle against the unforgiving vastness of space.  But the promise of intergalactic prosperity, and the expansion of human civilization, propelled her forward into the inky black.
