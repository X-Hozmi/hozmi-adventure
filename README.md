His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, the unwavering image of his sister's face, fueled his journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  He traveled through bustling market towns and desolate wastelands, his determination as strong as the steel of his sword.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates became commonplace as she traversed the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of celestial wonders, but the loneliness of space, the constant threat of malfunctioning equipment, and the unknown dangers lurking in the vast emptiness tested even her hardened spirit.  The fate of a lost civilization rested on her courage and skill, as she journeyed across the cosmic ocean.
