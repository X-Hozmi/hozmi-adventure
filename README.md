
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his journey across the treacherous, unforgiving terrain, a tapestry woven with peril and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of space anomalies were all in a day's work.  But the vast, inky expanse held a beauty that mirrored the dangers, and the potential to uncover the secrets of a long-lost civilization spurred Eva onward through the uncharted reaches of space.
