
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of bandits, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – wild beasts, rival knights, or the harsh realities of a unforgiving landscape.  His journey was a gamble against starvation, exhaustion, and the very will of fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming microbes to the newly colonized planet of Kepler-186f.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the occasional breathtaking vista of celestial wonders, was a constant companion. The threat wasn't bandits or wild animals but rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present danger of system failures light-years from any rescue.  The universe, vast and indifferent, tested her skill, courage, and resilience with every jump through hyperspace.
