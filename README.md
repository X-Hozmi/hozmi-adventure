
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and into the shadowed depths of ancient, forgotten forests.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – skirmishes with rival knights, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present gnawing uncertainty of whether he would ever reach his destination. The journey was arduous, a test of both body and spirit, but the allure of the unknown fueled his relentless pursuit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day's work.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas of unimaginable beauty, alongside terrifying encounters with unknown celestial phenomena and alien lifeforms. The journey was a testament to human resilience and ingenuity, a gamble on the possibility of finding life – or perhaps, the end of their own.
