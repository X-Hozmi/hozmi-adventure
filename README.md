The ancient map, its edges frayed and brittle, promised a forgotten city hidden amidst towering sand dunes, a city rumored to hold the secret to eternal life.

Anya knew the dangers of the unknown, the treacherous wormholes and unpredictable gravitational forces, but she was determined to unravel the secrets of the cosmos, one star system at a time.
