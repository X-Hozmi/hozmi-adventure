
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fleeting respite before another day of perilous travel towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Xylan civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the dangers were no less real – asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself posed constant threats.  Eva and her crew faced the vast emptiness of space, a cosmic ocean teeming with wonders and dangers, their courage and skill the only things standing between them and oblivion.
