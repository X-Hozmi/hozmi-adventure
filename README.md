
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a road, snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and ancient forests, the scent of pine and damp earth heavy in the air.  His quest: to reach the distant city of  Alexandria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  But the hope of salvation spurred him on, a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a mesmerizing tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, both awed and intimidated her.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant vigilance against unforeseen celestial events tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  Yet, the promise of discovering new life and expanding humanity's reach into the cosmos fueled her unwavering determination, a journey as perilous as any medieval knight's, but across a canvas far grander in scale.
