
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, a legendary barrier between his homeland and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumours of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic fuelled his journey, outweighing the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the harsh, unforgiving landscape.

Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar unity.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars was commonplace.  The true danger, however, lay in the unknown alien lifeforms that lurked in the unexplored sectors, their intentions as inscrutable as the vast, glittering expanse of the cosmos itself.
