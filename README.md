
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate plains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, with each sunrise came a renewed sense of purpose, a flicker of hope that fueled her relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, charting a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony was a daily challenge, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  But the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, and the potential rewards outweighed the risks, driving Comet and his crew ever onward towards the galactic frontier.
