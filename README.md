
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s ragged band crested the hill, their horses' hooves sinking into the parched earth.  Before them stretched the unforgiving expanse of the Whispering Wastes, a legend whispered in hushed tones throughout the kingdom.  Their quest – to recover the lost Orb of Aethelred – led them across treacherous mountain passes, through shadowed forests teeming with brigands, and across rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each day brought new perils: starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of ambush, yet the glint of the rumored Orb fueled their weary hearts.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting her cockpit window.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Their journey took them across light years of empty space, dodging asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and facing the existential dread of the void itself.  But the possibility of unlocking galactic exploration, of connecting with a potentially new civilization, made the unimaginable risks worthwhile.
