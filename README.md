
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I trudge across the snow-dusted plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier between me and my destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemical mastery.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of untold riches and knowledge, keeps my weary legs moving.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we jump to warp speed.  The swirling nebula outside my viewport is a breathtaking spectacle, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across the Andromeda Galaxy centuries ago.  Facing unknown alien species, malfunctioning technology, and the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space, this journey is as perilous as any medieval expedition, yet the potential rewards – contact with a long-lost civilization – make the risk worthwhile.
