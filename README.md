
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in the dust of a thousand miles, pushed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on our backs as we navigated the treacherous, overgrown tracks of the Breton countryside.  Each creak of our overloaded wagon, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers of apprehension down our spines.  Robbers, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend in the path, a constant reminder of the perils faced on this journey to the Holy Land, a quest for redemption and fortune intertwined.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our roadmap.  The crimson dust of Kepler-186f swirled around the landing struts of the *Stardust Drifter* as we prepared for our next leg of the journey.  This wasn't a pilgrimage, but an exploration – a search for habitable worlds amidst the glittering chaos of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the universe, but the vastness remained daunting, each jump a leap of faith across the unimaginable distances between star systems.  The thrill of discovery warred with the lonely isolation of the void.
