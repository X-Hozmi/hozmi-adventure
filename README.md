The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King, was fraught with peril, but the thought of the rewards, and the glory awaiting a successful knight, spurred him on.  He pressed onward, his heart pounding a rhythm against his ribs, a prayer on his lips for safe passage.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a month long even at near-light speed, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the crackle of comms chatter.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars and the swirling gas clouds, held a beauty and a terror all its own. But Eva, seasoned veteran of countless interstellar voyages, felt a familiar thrill – the intoxicating blend of risk and possibility that defined the life of a galactic explorer.
