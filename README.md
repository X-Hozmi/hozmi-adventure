
The creaking of the wagon wheels was a constant companion, a rhythmic counterpoint to the wind whistling through the gaps in the ancient oak forests.  Elias, his face grimy from weeks on the road, squinted at the setting sun, the fiery orb mirroring the burning ambition in his heart.  He was bound for the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a land of untold riches and magical artifacts.  Every bump in the road, every ford across a rushing river, was a challenge, a step closer to the legendary city and the adventure that awaited.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant foes, but the lure of the unknown propelled him onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a far cry from the groan of wagon wheels. Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of colours unimaginable to medieval travellers. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with its own perils.  Uncharted wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failures were the dangers she faced, not bandits or starvation. Yet, the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and charting a course into the unmapped cosmos, fuelled her just as fiercely as the medieval adventurer's dreams had propelled Elias.
