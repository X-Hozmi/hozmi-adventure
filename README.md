
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village promises respite, but the whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Forest keep her ever vigilant.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for danger or discovery, turning her journey from a simple pilgrimage into a thrilling test of courage and resilience across the uncharted landscapes of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  Ahead lie the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a tapestry of swirling gases and unexplored planets.  While the dangers are different – cosmic storms, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of engine failure – the thrill of the unknown remains.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite expanse, driven by the same insatiable human desire to explore the farthest corners of the universe.
