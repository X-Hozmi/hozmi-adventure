
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the late afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a swirling brown cloud marking their passage across the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey, a perilous pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had already claimed several companions to disease and bandit attacks.  Reginald clutched the worn map, its edges frayed and stained with sweat and rain, the promise of Jerusalem a fragile hope against the backdrop of a harsh, unpredictable world. Each sunrise brought new challenges - treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the constant threat of human predators.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life – the spirit of adventure remained the same: a relentless push against the unknown, fuelled by a thirst for discovery and a courageous heart willing to brave the infinite.
