
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a healing balm for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of Ys, and the hope it represented, spurred him forward, each sunrise renewing his resolve amidst the unpredictable dangers of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a cosmic anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the complex web of wormholes demanded precision and courage.  Unlike the medieval journeys of old, hers was a lonely venture amongst the vast, indifferent expanse of space, the cold vacuum a constant reminder of the immense distances and unpredictable dangers inherent in interstellar travel.
