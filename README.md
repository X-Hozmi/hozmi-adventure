
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's writ burned a hole in his pocket, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city far to the east.  His journey was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the malice of men.  He carried not only the King's message, but the weight of a kingdom's hope on his weary shoulders.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  The dangers were of a different order – gravitational anomalies threatening to rip the ship apart, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant gnawing anxiety of being so impossibly far from home. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of uncharted systems, fueled her spirit.  Every jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, every new planet a thrilling adventure.
