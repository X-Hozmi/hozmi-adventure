
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the grueling rhythm of travel – the creak of saddle leather, the rhythmic thud of hooves, the ever-present threat of bandits and blizzards.  Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, but also the grim reality of a journey that tested his courage, his endurance, and the very limits of his will.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of subspace communications and the tense silence of navigating asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even her seasoned experience, a stark reminder of the infinite challenges and boundless wonders that awaited her at the edge of known reality.
