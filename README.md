
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's armour as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the threat of drowning, and the ever-present fear of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead, a tapestry woven with hardship, resilience, and the faint, unwavering hope of reaching his destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the ethereal glow of a nebula.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, a journey measured not in leagues but light-years.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrifying beauty, punctuated by the blinding flash of distant novas and the silent, creeping dread of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations. Yet, fueled by human curiosity and a thirst for the unknown, Eva pressed onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking, terrifying infinity of the cosmos.
