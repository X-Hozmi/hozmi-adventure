
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery hidden high in the Pyrenees, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each whispered rumor of bandits in the dark forests, fueled the thrill of her perilous journey.  The road was a tapestry of vibrant life and looming danger, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of her starship's engines a stark contrast to the cosmic ballet unfolding before her.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems. Each hyperspace jump, each tense encounter with space pirates lurking in asteroid fields, each breathtaking view of alien planets, was a gamble against the infinite vastness of space. The cosmos was her canvas, a thrilling and terrifying playground for a lone explorer.
