
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara's small band of travelers pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored holy city of Eldoria, had already claimed two horses and tested their resolve to the breaking point.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation were their daily companions.  Yet, the shimmering promise of Eldoria, whispered in hushed tones across taverns and campfires, fueled their weary steps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-earned rest under the vast, indifferent sky.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the veil of nebulae, its hyperdrive humming a song of distant worlds.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Arm of Xylos, a region teeming with unmapped planets and rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic storms raged, alien lifeforms threatened, and the constant pressure of deep space travel tested both the ship and its crew.  But the allure of discovery, the tantalizing possibility of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets, drove them ever onward, toward the edge of known space and into the heart of the unknown.
