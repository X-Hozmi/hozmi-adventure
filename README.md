
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary steed onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by goblins and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Eldoria and retrieve the stolen Sunstone, a task fraught with peril, from bandits and treacherous terrain to the unpredictable whims of nature.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, both exhilarating and terrifying.  Survival itself was the ultimate prize.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with dangers far beyond the medieval knight's wildest nightmares.  Warp storms threatened to tear her ship apart, alien leviathans lurked in the void, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders added to the pressure.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover the fate of a lost civilization, fueled her relentless drive across the cosmos.
