
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered legends, guides her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each snapping twig, holds the potential for bandit ambush or the sudden, unforgiving bite of winter.  Yet, the lure of hope, as strong as the unforgiving terrain, pushes her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields is routine, but the unknown always lurks – a rogue black hole, a hostile alien civilization, or the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any known outpost.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos planet, rumored to contain a source of energy that could save her dying world.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the potential reward, like Eldoria before it, fuels her courage and keeps her engines humming.
