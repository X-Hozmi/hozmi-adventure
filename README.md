
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadow of ancient, brooding forests.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the unknown fueled their resolve, a potent mix of faith and the thrill of the open road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace.  The vast emptiness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held far greater dangers than any medieval bandit, but the promise of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries, spurred Eva onward – a modern knight errant charting a course among the stars.
