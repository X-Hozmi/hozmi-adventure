
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Shrine of St. Elara, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of the Whispering Woods, a place whispered to be haunted by ancient evils.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the wild – forging their bond and testing their courage in ways no courtly life could ever prepare them for.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known systems, relied on their advanced technology and unwavering camaraderie to navigate the cosmic expanse, each jump a gamble against the vastness of space and the unknown terrors it held.
