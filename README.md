
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, or the sickness itself.  But the hope of salvation spurred him on, across muddy tracks and treacherous mountain passes, a solitary figure against the immense, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the loneliness of traversing the inky blackness, light years from any known civilization.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, fueled her journey across the vast expanse of space, a tiny ship against the unimaginable immensity of the cosmos.
