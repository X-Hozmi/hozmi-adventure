
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the rhythmic thud of hooves on hard earth, the sting of sand in his eyes, and the ever-present threat of bandits and starvation. Each sunrise offered a new challenge, a new obstacle to overcome in this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him not only his sword but also the hope of glory, a promise whispered by the wind and the stars.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust painting the cockpit in hues of alien beauty.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable space currents and hostile alien lifeforms, the loneliness of interstellar travel a heavy weight. But Elara, hardened by years spent charting the unmapped reaches of space, pressed on, her heart filled with the hope of finding survivors, a beacon in the vast, uncaring darkness.
