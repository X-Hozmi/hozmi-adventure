
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air. Her worn map, more tattered than accurate, guided her towards the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving desert threatened dehydration and delirium at every turn. Yet, the whispers of Zerzura’s legendary riches and the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and breathtaking landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Althea's warp drive a constant companion.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with strange and potentially hostile lifeforms.  The vastness of space, the shimmering constellations, and the ever-present risk of encountering rogue asteroids or unforeseen gravitational anomalies, made each jump to hyperspace a gamble, a thrilling dance with the unknown amidst the cosmic ballet of stars and galaxies.
