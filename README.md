
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and a meager supply of water; it contained a map, rumored to lead to a lost monastery said to hold the secret to a miraculous healing balm.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey, but the promise of healing for her ailing brother spurred her onward, a single determined figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare crystalline element from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, vital for powering the intergalactic federation's new warp drive.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and facing the harsh realities of alien environments were commonplace hazards. But for Nova, the thrill of exploration outweighed the danger, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a testament to humanity's relentless push across the cosmos.
