
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the already fading light.  Their journey, a perilous trek to the distant kingdom of Eldoria, was fraught with danger – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim them, and the ever-present specter of famine shadowed their every step.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a desperate scramble for shelter, but the lure of Eldoria's rumored riches and the thrill of the unknown fueled their weary bodies and steadfast spirits.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, a months-long odyssey through the inky blackness punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant star clusters and the eerie silence of interstellar space, was a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of discovery.  The potential dangers – unforeseen gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – were a constant companion, yet the promise of finding new life, new worlds, outweighed any fear.
