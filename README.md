
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her small band of mercenaries, a motley crew bound by shared hardship and the promise of gold, pressed onward toward Avignon. Rumors of a hidden Templar treasure, buried centuries ago, fueled their journey, a siren song tempting them through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes. Each sunset brought a new peril, each sunrise a renewed hope of discovering fortune – or meeting a violent end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The mission: to locate and retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Facing asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of system failure, Rexx and his crew risked everything, propelled by the urgent need to secure their galaxy's future and the thrill of exploring the unknown.
