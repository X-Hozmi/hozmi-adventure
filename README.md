
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aragon, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it holds the hope of finding her long-lost brother, a whisper of a rumour leading her across treacherous mountain passes and through lawless forests.  Each night spent under a canopy of stars brings new challenges – bandits, starvation, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown, but the thrill of discovery fuels her onward.  The ancient trade routes, a tapestry of human endeavor and hardship, are her guide.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, navigates asteroid fields and wormholes, their destination a newly discovered planet rumored to harbour sentient life.  The vast emptiness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating; the thrill of charting unmapped territories and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries outweighs the risks of encountering hostile alien species or catastrophic equipment failure.  The cosmos is their canvas, and the Stardust Drifter, their brush.
