
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the creeping despair of the journey itself.  The promise of Eldoria, however fantastical, fueled his determination against the harsh realities of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its swirling colours a breathtaking but deceptive backdrop to the perilous journey ahead.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the complexities of hyperspace were child's play compared to the political maneuvering and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on interstellar trade routes. The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile position amidst the galaxy.
