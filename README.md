
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires, whispered about in hushed tones by weary travelers, fueled his relentless journey across the ravaged land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, she relied on her trusty AI, Zephyr, and the courage of her crew.  The vast, unexplored expanse of the cosmos held both unimaginable wonders and deadly threats, but the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the colony's mystery, propelled them ever onward across the galactic expanse.
