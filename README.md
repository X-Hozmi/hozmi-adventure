
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the skeletal peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient healing knowledge, fueled her perilous journey across the treacherous lands, a journey fraught with bandits, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each day brought new challenges, testing her resilience and spirit, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a hypnotic distraction from the complex calculations required for a successful jump to the Andromeda galaxy.  Ahead lay the unexplored Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor sentient life unlike any encountered before.  The risks were colossal – unpredictable gravitational currents, uncharted wormholes, and the ever-present danger of pirate raids – but the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, outweighed every fear.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, fueled the crew’s relentless pursuit of the unknown.
