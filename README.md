The rumors of a legendary artifact, rumored to possess unimaginable power, had lured him from his castle, driving him across the wild, untamed lands. Danger lurked around every corner, from ferocious beasts to bandits and rival knights. But Alistair was determined, driven by the thrill of the unknown and the allure of the artifact, a relic of a forgotten age.

Zara's heart thrummed with a mix of fear and excitement, knowing the risks, but driven by an insatiable curiosity for the mysteries that awaited them on the far side of the cosmos.
