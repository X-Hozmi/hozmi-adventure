
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule train as it snaked across the sun-baked plains.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a heartbeat in the vast, silent landscape.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the desert itself, a merciless mistress, threatened dehydration and delirium.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura's untold riches and the promise of adventure fueled their weary steps, pushing them ever onward toward the horizon's shimmering mirage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet void.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid field of Xylos was child's play compared to the political minefield of the Galactic Federation. Her mission: to secure a rare mineral from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The risks were colossal – alien life, hostile factions, and the ever-present danger of system collapse – but the potential reward, a new era of interstellar exploration, burned brighter than any nebula.
