
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward. The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless expanse of the French countryside, a stark contrast to the chill wind whistling through the mountain passes just days before.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, pushed her onward despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Each creak of the saddle, each clop of hooves, marked another step closer to her uncertain destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the groaning of the starship 'Stardust Drifter' a familiar lullaby as they jumped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  His mission: to secure a rare mineral vital to the survival of his people.  The dangers were far different than those faced by Elara - hostile alien lifeforms, treacherous nebulae, and the ever-present threat of pirates prowling the interstellar lanes. Yet, the thirst for discovery, the unwavering determination to reach their goal, burned just as brightly in Rexx’s heart as it had in Elara’s.
