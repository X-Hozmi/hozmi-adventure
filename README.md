
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion against her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable terrain threatened to claim both her and her beast. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of discovery, propelled her onward, each perilous step a testament to her courage and unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have mastered faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, Ryla pushed the boundaries of human exploration, charting unmapped constellations and facing the existential dread of the vast, unforgiving cosmos.  The galaxy was her canvas, and her journey, a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity reaching for the stars.
