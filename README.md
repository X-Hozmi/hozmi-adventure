
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager meals in dusty villages, and enduring the suspicion of those who saw him as a stranger.  Yet, with every league covered, a thrilling sense of freedom and the promise of untold riches and exotic sights fuelled his weary bones.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  Facing down asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs, Elara and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration. The vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy stretched before them, a canvas of infinite possibilities and terrifying unknowns.
