
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered legends, guided her towards the mythical city of Ys, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected storms, and the ever-present threat of illness hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each arduous mile, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a defiant spirit against the limitations of her time and circumstance.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a silent path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems was a constant challenge. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization on the fringes of known space.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of oblivion, a gamble worth taking for the intrepid crew aboard the *Stardust Drifter*.
