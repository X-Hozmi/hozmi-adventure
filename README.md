
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Rumors of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient texts and untold riches, fueled her perilous journey.  Each creaking step brings her closer to the unknown, a constant companion the gnawing fear of bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unexplored, keeps her pushing onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart a course through unmapped galaxies, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, holds dangers beyond imagining – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  But Ryla, fueled by a sense of duty and a thirst for the unknown, steers her ship into the darkness, a lone explorer carrying the hopes of her species on her shoulders.
