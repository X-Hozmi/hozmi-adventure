
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were but small obstacles in her determined stride.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a renewed hope that fueled her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in the starship *Stardust*.  Their mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant K'tharr Empire, a journey spanning light-years and countless unexplored systems.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raids, and repairing damaged warp engines were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty alongside unimaginable peril, but the lure of the unknown and the promise of interstellar commerce spurred Jax and her crew onwards, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the uncharted wonders of the galaxy.
