
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his frame, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains, a mocking prelude to the perilous journey ahead.  He and his small band of companions, bound for the mythical city of Eldoria, navigated treacherous mountain passes, skirted bandit-infested forests, and braved the relentless sun, their determination fueled by whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of their pack animals, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and mortal danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, battling cosmic radiation and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, was a far cry from the challenges faced by medieval travelers. Yet, the spirit of adventure remained the same - a fearless plunge into the unknown, driven by the human thirst for discovery and the hope of finding something extraordinary amidst the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
