
The medieval era was a time of great adventure for those brave enough to venture beyond their village walls.  Travelling by foot, horseback, or by riverboat, they might encounter bandits, storms, and unfamiliar cultures.  Their goal might be trade, pilgrimage, or simply the thrill of the unknown, leading them to far-off lands and back, richer in experience and knowledge than they had ever dreamed.

In the distant future, the stars beckon with a promise of untold wonders.  Spacefaring adventurers traverse the cosmos in sleek starships, navigating nebulae and black holes to explore uncharted planets and discover ancient alien civilizations.  They encounter perilous cosmic storms and face the unknown with courage and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of human exploration and uncovering the secrets of the universe.
