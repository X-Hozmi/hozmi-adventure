
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost Orb of Aethelred, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest, where whispers of ancient evils still lingered in the air. Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous terrain, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Survival was a daily victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Genesis planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril: unpredictable gravitational anomalies, encounters with hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failures in the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking galactic secrets, fueled her unwavering resolve.
