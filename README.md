
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was far from the romanticized tales of courtly life.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the grueling rhythm of horse and foot travel.  They braved treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers, and skirted bandit-infested forests, their meager supplies dwindling with each sunrise.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The rhythmic hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the soft glow of navigation consoles.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage could ever be, held its own perils: asteroid fields, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena, each a potential end to their ambitious voyage.
