
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Before her stretches the vast, unforgiving expanse of the plains, a journey of weeks to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the promise of adventure, and the potential for peril.  Her map, a faded parchment passed down through generations, is her only guide, leading her ever closer to a destiny both unknown and potentially life-altering.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust Drifter*, a vessel that leaps across galaxies in the blink of an eye.  Her current mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the silent hum of the hyperdrive masks the whispers of cosmic radiation and the potential threats lurking in the unexplored reaches of the cosmos.  Each jump across the void is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with riches beyond measure - or oblivion - as the possible reward.
