
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising riches in the fabled city of  Zaragoza.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the relentless sun threatened to bake her alive, but the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of lost treasures, spurred her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the dry grass, was a potential encounter, a test of her courage and resourcefulness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. Yet,  the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, the discovery of new worlds, and the promise of a future for her people fueled her journey across the cosmic sea.
