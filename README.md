
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys across the treacherous terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient knowledge and untold riches, had lured him from his quiet village life.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dense forest, fueled both his apprehension and his burning thirst for adventure; the unknown lay ahead, a tapestry woven with peril and the tantalizing promise of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, inky silence of space.  This was not a quest for gold or glory, but for the survival of humanity, a mission fraught with the dangers of uncharted systems and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.  Yet, for Eva, the thrill of exploring the unimaginable, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, was a reward greater than any earthly treasure.
