
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested her resolve.  Yet, the allure of the lost oasis, promising untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed vow to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, uncharted territory even for seasoned explorers.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets demanded unwavering focus and precision. The potential rewards, however – a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – made the harrowing journey worthwhile. The vast expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Ryla, like Elara before her, was driven by an unyielding thirst for discovery.
