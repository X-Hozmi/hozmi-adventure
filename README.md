
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring rains all tested his resolve.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless pursuit across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas, her destination a distant galaxy containing a rumored habitable planet.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was child's play compared to the political intrigue and intergalactic rivalries she faced.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held dangers far beyond anything Sir Reginald could have imagined.  Yet, fueled by the potential for discovery and the hope of finding a new home for humanity, Eva pressed onward, a lone adventurer charting a course through the cosmic sea.
