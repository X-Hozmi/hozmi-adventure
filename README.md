
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth’s retinue as they traverse the unforgiving landscape, their horses’ hooves kicking up stones on the sun-baked track.  The quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death that ravages their homeland.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Ys, of shimmering spires and healing waters, fuel their weary bodies and emboldened spirits, pushing them ever onward toward the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, measured in light-years, is a tapestry woven with the hum of warp drives, the crackling of subspace comms, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien lifeforms or unforeseen celestial anomalies.  While the physical hardships are different—radiation shielding, cryogenic sleep cycles, and the psychological toll of isolation—the spirit of adventure remains the same: a relentless pursuit of the unknown, fueled by curiosity and a thirst for discovery that transcends time and space.
