
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small prices to pay for the chance to uncover its secrets – a journey fueled by ancient maps, a thirst for adventure, and a desperate hope for fortune to ease her family's crippling poverty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The risks were immense – unpredictable wormholes, pirate raids from the Kryll syndicate, and the ever-present danger of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving vastness of space.  But the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and claiming a place in galactic history spurred him onwards, a lone star in the infinite darkness.
