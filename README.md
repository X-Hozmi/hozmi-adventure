
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of hardtack, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between me and the unknown.  Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, but the promise of the rumored lost city of Eldoria spurred me onward, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  My destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling nebulae and distant stars, both terrified and exhilarated me.  The risks were different now – radiation storms, gravitational anomalies, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – yet the thrill of discovery, the yearning to explore the uncharted reaches of the cosmos, burned just as fiercely as it had for those medieval adventurers who braved the forests and mountains of their world.
