
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, a cacophony of smells and shouts.  Now, weeks later, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hangs heavy as we trudge through the unforgiving French countryside.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, struggles onward towards the Holy Land.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing uncertainty of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of disease, yet the whispered promise of Jerusalem, and the thrill of the unknown, spurs us on.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive, a constant thrum against the backdrop of the star-strewn void.  We're weeks into our journey between galaxies, our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The crew, a diverse team of scientists and explorers, monitors the ship's systems with quiet diligence, the vast, uncaring expanse of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life, and the monumental ambition of our quest. The sheer scale of the journey, the promise of discovering alien life, and the challenges of navigating uncharted territories fuel our determination.
