Ahead lay the Pyrenees, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the whispered promise of a life free from the plague's shadow spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the encroaching darkness.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and uncertainty, but also with the raw, thrilling beauty of a world largely unexplored.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the swirling nebula of the Andromeda galaxy a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous voyage.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr patrols, Eva and her crew faced challenges that dwarfed even the most daunting medieval quest.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested their courage and resilience, pushing them to the limits of human endurance in a quest that would determine the fate of their fledgling galactic federation.
