
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-covered plains, a stark contrast to the bustling markets I'd left behind in Prague.  Ahead lay the mythical city of K'tharr, whispered about in hushed tones by merchants and scholars alike, rumored to hold secrets lost to time.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers, and evading bandits who lurked in the shadows.  Survival depended on wits, courage, and a healthy dose of luck.


A thousand years hence, the stars themselves were my highway. The Althea, a sleek starship boasting engines that bent spacetime, cut through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace centuries ago.  The vast distances, the unpredictable nebulae, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids all posed constant danger.  But the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, eclipsed the peril.  Every jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble on a future yet unwritten.
