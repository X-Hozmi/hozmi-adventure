
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track as I urged my weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled the air, a stark contrast to the tales of exotic spices and shimmering silks whispered in the taverns of Rouen. My quest? To find the lost city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Black Forest, a journey fraught with peril from brigands, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, each sunset a gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we jumped between galaxies, the vast emptiness punctuated only by the occasional nebula, a cosmic brushstroke across the black canvas.  My mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos cluster, a region teeming with unexplored planets, each promising untold riches or catastrophic danger.  The risks were different now – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the potential hostility of alien civilizations – but the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, remained as potent as ever.
