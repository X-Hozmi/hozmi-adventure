
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Behind us lay weeks of perilous journeys: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging to sheer cliffs, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of El Dorado, a city of unimaginable riches hidden deep within the Amazon, fueled our onward march, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath, was a testament to the relentless pursuit of our impossible dream.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our guide.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, sliced through the inky void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a kaleidoscope of nebulae, breathtaking vistas of celestial bodies swirling in cosmic ballets, and the constant hum of the Althea's engines, a lullaby against the terrifying vastness of space.  But the promise of a new era of interstellar exploration, a future beyond our wildest imaginings, made the dangers of warp-jumps and uncharted space worthwhile.
