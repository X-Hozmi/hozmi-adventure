
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the relentless sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Ahead lay the vast, unknown expanse of the Whispering Woods, a perilous journey to reach her ailing brother in the distant kingdom of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this medieval pilgrimage, testing her strength and resolve with each passing mile.  Yet, the hope of reunion fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining bio-engineered algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates were commonplace hazards on this interstellar voyage, a far cry from the simpler dangers of the past.  But the weight of responsibility, the knowledge that countless lives depended on his successful delivery, spurred him on through the vast, unforgiving beauty of the cosmos.
