
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel bumping against her thigh.  The map, a faded parchment clutched in her hand, promised riches and adventure beyond the next mountain range – a lost city rumored to hold secrets older than Christendom itself.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting a course across unmapped territories, and the whispered legends that fueled her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, the Milky Way a breathtaking tapestry outside his viewport.  His mission: to traverse the Andromeda galaxy, charting newly discovered wormholes and seeking out habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien races, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself – but the spirit of adventure remained the same: a yearning to push the boundaries of the known, to explore the vast, uncharted cosmos, and to return with tales that would inspire generations to come.
