
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He’d left the familiar comfort of his village weeks ago, spurred by whispers of a lost city brimming with ancient secrets, somewhere beyond the Whisperwind Mountains. Each day brought new challenges: treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown wilderness. But the lure of adventure, the possibility of uncovering forgotten knowledge, burned brighter than any hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement vanished without a trace decades ago.  The vast emptiness of space, the threat of unpredictable stellar phenomena, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien civilizations presented a different kind of peril, but the thrill of exploration, the hope of finding answers to a profound mystery, propelled them forward across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
