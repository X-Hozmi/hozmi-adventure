
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crested the hill.  The vast, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine stretched before them, a tapestry of ochre and gold punctuated by the occasional wind-whipped tree.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint-Seraphine, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the hope that burned in her heart, fueling each weary step across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson light of its dying sun.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling the oppressive solitude of interstellar travel were all part of a day's work for a seasoned spacer like Nova. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, and the promise of untold riches kept her engine humming across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
