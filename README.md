
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel contained not gold, but seeds – seeds of a rumored miracle crop that could save her village from starvation.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for banditry, disease, or worse.  Yet, the hope of survival, the chance to return a hero, spurred her onward through the unforgiving landscape, past crumbling castles and across churning rivers, a solitary figure against the vast and perilous medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Nird, a perilous journey across light-years and through treacherous asteroid fields.  His crew, a motley band of seasoned spacefarers, faced down alien predators, navigated gravitational anomalies, and outwitted rival corporations all in pursuit of this invaluable resource.  The vast, uncharted reaches of space were their battlefield, and the universe itself, their adventure.
