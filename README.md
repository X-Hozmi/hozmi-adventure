Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under the overcast sky, gripped his sword hilt, ever vigilant.  This journey across the kingdom, a quest to recover the stolen relic of St. Elmo, was fraught with peril, testing not only his strength but his resolve against the harsh elements and the even harsher hearts of men. Every sunrise held the promise of new challenges, from treacherous mountain passes to the unsettling silence of deserted villages.

A thousand parsecs lay between Captain Eva Rostova and her destination, the Xylos system, a shimmering jewel across the galactic arm.

But the discovery of a lost civilization on Xylos, one whispered to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying homeworld, fueled her every action.  The vastness of space felt both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the scale of her mission.
