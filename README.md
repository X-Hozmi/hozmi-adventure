
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the dusty plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new trials – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless expanse.  But the lure of Zerzura, the promise of a legend fulfilled, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by the cosmic void decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's cutting-edge technology.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, presented a constant threat, making each jump between galaxies a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
