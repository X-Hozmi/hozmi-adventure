
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Alora, had already claimed two horses and tested their resolve against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating by the stars to bartering for meager sustenance in dust-choked villages.  The legendary shrine, they hoped, held the cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland, and their desperate quest fueled their weary legs.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanite crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  Asteroids the size of moons loomed in their path, and pirate ships, sleek and deadly, lurked in the shadows between star systems.  But the allure of fortune and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of known space kept Eva and her crew focused on their course, their ship a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.
