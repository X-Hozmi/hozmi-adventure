
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested her endurance daily, and whispers of plague stalked her every step. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown pushed her further, the promise of spiritual redemption and personal discovery outweighing the hardships.  The medieval world was a tapestry woven with danger and beauty, and she, a humble thread, was weaving her own story across its vast expanse.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Ronson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission:  to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new trade routes and habitable planets for a burgeoning interstellar federation.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  But Razor, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown, pressed onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the heart of the cosmos, a testament to human ambition and the relentless pursuit of adventure across the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
