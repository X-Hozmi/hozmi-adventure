
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward, pushing her through treacherous mountain passes and across desolate plains, a lone adventurer against the vastness of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the Andromeda galaxy.  Ahead lay uncharted territories teeming with alien lifeforms both benevolent and hostile.  Her mission: a scientific expedition to collect samples from a newly discovered planet believed to hold the key to interstellar travel.  Unlike Elara's journey, Eva’s relied on advanced technology, but the vastness of space posed a different kind of challenge, an isolation punctuated by the constant hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown dangers in the cosmic expanse.
