
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts – bandits, disease, and the unforgiving landscape all threaten our journey. Yet, the lure of the East, the whisper of silks and spices, and the promise of untold riches fuels our onward march, each creak of a wagon wheel a testament to our unwavering resolve in this grand medieval adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of space.  Each jump to warp speed is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The quest for a legendary lost civilization on the planet Xylos, a world shrouded in myth and rumored to hold unimaginable technological advancements, drives our crew onward.  The vastness of the cosmos is a daunting prospect, but the promise of discovery outweighs any fear.
