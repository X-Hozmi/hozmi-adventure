
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood – a grim reminder of the bandit raid they'd barely escaped.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, a perilous path to the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a constant reminder of the risks she faced in her desperate quest across a land teeming with danger and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel had opened the galaxy, yet the dangers were no less real.  Pirate raids, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes all presented constant threats.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unknown, a gamble against the vastness and the indifference of space.
