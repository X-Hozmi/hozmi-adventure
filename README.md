
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her loyal hound, Jasper, panting at her heels.  Their journey to the rumored lost city of Zerzura is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed canyons, treacherous rivers must be forded, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of endurance, but the whispered legends of Zerzura, and the promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge, fuel their relentless push onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, a sleek vessel slicing through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The vast distances are dwarfed only by the unimaginable dangers lurking in the void – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  But Ryla, driven by the insatiable human thirst for discovery, steers her crew towards the unmapped territories, charting a course into the unknown with unwavering courage and a healthy dose of fear.
