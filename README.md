
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a newly-colonized planet struggling to sustain life.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was a daily routine, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of her isolation.  But the knowledge that her cargo held the seeds of a new civilization, a beacon of hope for humanity's expansion across the stars, fuelled her relentless journey through the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
