
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth range looming before them.  Their journey from the King's court to the distant Sultanate had been fraught with peril – bandits ambushing their supply train, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of untold riches and the whispered promise of ancient magic spurred them onward, each weary step a testament to their unwavering resolve in the face of the medieval world's unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Alien encounters, volatile stellar phenomena, and the ever-present risk of system failure were everyday challenges for this intrepid crew, their journey a testament to humanity's relentless drive for exploration beyond the confines of their solar system.
