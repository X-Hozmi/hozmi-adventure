
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in the shadowed forests, the ever-present threat of disease in crowded villages, and the unpredictable temper of the rivers were just some of the challenges facing him.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, each sunset a silent prayer for survival as he traversed the vast, untamed landscape of medieval Europe, driven by a hope for a better life beyond the familiar.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through a nebula of swirling crimson gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of rogue gravitational forces were everyday hazards.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held its own brand of terrifying unknowns, but the promise of discovery fueled Eva's journey, a voyage across the galactic expanse for a future humanity yet dreamed of.
