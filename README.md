
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the relentless sun beating down on his chainmail.  His journey from the windswept highlands of Scotland to the sun-drenched vineyards of France was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked him like a wraith. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory, forging him into a man as resilient as the steel of his sword.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic wonders and deadly radiation, stretched endlessly before her.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies across the Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage measured not in days or weeks but in years. While the dangers differed - rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders - the thrill of exploration, the pushing of boundaries, echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved the unknown lands long ago.
