
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his mount onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Albion, a stark contrast to the bustling market towns left behind. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril from brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast distance yet to travel. His only companions were his loyal steed and the unwavering hope that fuelled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars tested her piloting skills and the ship's resilience to its limits.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the immense scale of her mission and the fragility of life in the face of the cosmos.  The success of this expedition rested on her shoulders, a weight as heavy as the stars themselves.
