
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each mountain pass presented a new challenge – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Saragossa, the hope of healing, fueled her onward, transforming every hardship into a step closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ry" Kepler piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with unmapped gravitational anomalies and the ever-present danger of pirate incursions.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes. Each jump to lightspeed was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown, rewarded only by the breathtaking beauty of distant suns and the unwavering pursuit of discovery.
