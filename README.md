
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each day brought new challenges:  bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous bogs threatening to swallow man and beast whole, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge, spurred him onwards, a flicker of hope against the daunting landscape.  He traveled with only his loyal squire, Thomas, and the memories of his family, a powerful engine in this arduous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, held its own perils.  Cosmic radiation threatened the ship's integrity, unpredictable asteroid fields demanded precise navigation, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space pressed heavily on the crew.  But Eva, a veteran of countless deep-space missions, held firm. The promise of discovering a new home for humanity, a chance to rewrite the history of humankind, was a beacon brighter than any star.
