His quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a jewel said to hold the very light of the kingdom.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts all lay ahead, but the glory of reclaiming the stone, and the promise of the King's favour, fueled his tireless journey across the land. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory, forging Reginald into a legend in the making.

Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, as it jumped across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, a region rumored to contain a rare element crucial to sustaining life on her dying homeworld.  Navigating treacherous nebulae, evading pirate raiders who lurked in the shadowy corners of space, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic storms were all part of the perilous journey. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a constant test of skill and courage, but the fate of her people rested on her success.
