
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate hope against the bleak reality of her homeland’s famine, a test of her courage and resilience in a world unforgiving to the weak.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive screaming as they jumped between galaxies.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to possess a power source capable of ending the intergalactic war.  The journey was fraught with peril: pirate raids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of the K'tharr Empire.  But Rexx, hardened by years of interstellar skirmishes, pressed onward, driven by a desperate need to secure a future for his people, a future bought with the risk of unimaginable loss.
