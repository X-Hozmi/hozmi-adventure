
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of bustling markets and shadowed forests he'd traversed.  His quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a legendary artifact said to hold the power of the very sun itself.  Each sunrise brought fresh dangers – bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled his journey, a potent elixir against fatigue and fear.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense distances they were conquering.  Unlike the medieval knights before her, Eva faced perils of a different kind – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on interstellar trade routes.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, was a beacon guiding her through the inky black of space.
