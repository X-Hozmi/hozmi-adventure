
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three packhorses laden with meager supplies, crested the windswept hill.  Before them lay a tapestry of emerald valleys and dark, brooding forests, the route to the mythical city of Eldoria stretching out like a challenge whispered on the wind.  Each day brought new trials: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of Eldoria, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and potent magic, fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' a sleek vessel capable of folding space, towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, navigated asteroid fields and wormholes, facing down cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of rogue AI. The promise of discovering new civilizations, planets teeming with life unimagined, and unlocking the mysteries of the universe pushed them onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
