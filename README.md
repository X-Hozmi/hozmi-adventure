
The year is 1347.  Dust coats my worn leather jerkin as I urge my weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead, the rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient texts and untold riches, beckon like a siren's call.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease stalk the road, testing the limits of my endurance and the loyalty of my companions.  Will we find glory, or only graves in this unforgiving land?


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive lulls me into a restless sleep as the *Stardust Drifter* hurtles through the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The shimmering nebulae outside the viewport are a breathtaking spectacle, but the real adventure lies in the unknown.  Will the Xylosian civilization be benevolent or hostile?  Will we uncover the secrets of faster-than-light travel, or become another footnote in the annals of interstellar exploration, lost amongst the countless stars?  The gamble is immense, the potential rewards… unimaginable.
