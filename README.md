
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each arduous mile, the thrill of adventure coursed through her veins, a potent cocktail of fear and exhilaration fueled by the promise of reaching her sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the swirling nebulae outside his starship a kaleidoscope of unimaginable colours. His mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos galaxy, a treacherous expanse rumored to hold both unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable dangers.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made every jump a gamble.  For Rexx, however, the unknown was a siren's call, a promise of glory and discovery that eclipsed any personal risk.
