
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of bread, and a rusty sword – felt inadequate against the vast unknown. Yet, the promise of the fabled Dragon's Tooth mountain, said to hold a cure for my ailing sister, spurred me onward, each step a gamble against the perils of the medieval world.

Conversely, in the 27th century, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we jumped between star systems.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of nebulae, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery that lay beyond the known galaxy, dwarfed the risks, and the crew pressed on, our hopes pinned on reaching a new frontier.
