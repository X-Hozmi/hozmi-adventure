
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her leather armor.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope fueled her journey, turning every hardship into a testament to her determination.  The whispered stories of Zerzura, of shimmering oasis and ancient wisdom, spurred her onward through the unforgiving landscape of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Navigating through nebulae and asteroid fields, she faced the constant threat of cosmic radiation and unknown alien entities.  But the weight of her people's survival, and the faint signal echoing from the distant colony, propelled her starship forward. Each jump through hyperspace brought her closer to the potential salvation of her world, a salvation hidden amidst the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
