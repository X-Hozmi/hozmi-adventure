Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a legend whispered in hushed tones around crackling campfires.  Bandits, harsh weather, and treacherous terrain were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the allure of uncovering forgotten secrets, the thrill of the unknown, fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges and the hope of discovering something extraordinary.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the backdrop of a thousand burning suns.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were daily occurrences, but the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored galaxies, and the promise of uncovering groundbreaking scientific discoveries spurred her forward, even in the face of unimaginable distances and perils.
