
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks a stark contrast to the sun-drenched valleys below.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King's court.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were constant companions on her perilous journey, testing her resilience at every turn, but the thought of her people spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her grit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the aggressive space pirates of the Kryll Syndicate was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown – the potential for undiscovered life forms, volatile planetary conditions, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space.  The allure of discovery, the promise of new resources, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories fueled his daring expedition across the galaxy.
