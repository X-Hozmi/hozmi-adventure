
The year is 1348.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, turning the journey into a constant battle against both the unforgiving landscape and the gnawing fear that gnawed at her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent color as his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research outpost on Xylos, a planet rumored to be teeming with hostile, bio-engineered creatures.  The journey was routine, but the destination held a chilling uncertainty, a gamble with fate that only the bravest – or the most desperate – dared to take.
