
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Aragon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Eadmund, a journey that had already claimed three of his companions to bandits, fever, and the unforgiving wilderness.  Each sunrise brought the looming shadow of starvation and ambush, each sunset the chilling whisper of failure. Yet, the glint of the distant mountains, rumored to hold the relic's resting place, fueled his relentless march.


Centuries hence, Captain Elara Reyes navigated the Xylos Nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny mote against the backdrop of swirling gas giants and incandescent stars.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos Prime, a signal from which had faintly reached Earth after decades of silence.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, each a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate raiders.  But Elara, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, held fast to hope, her gaze fixed on the celestial map charting a path through the uncharted voids to a potential new home, or perhaps a grave.
