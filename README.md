
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the parched plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as his small band pressed onward, their meager supplies dwindling with each league.  Rumors of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and jewels, fueled their perilous journey, tempting them through treacherous mountain passes and across rivers teeming with unseen dangers.  Each night, huddled around a sputtering fire, they shared stories of bravery and loss, their hope as fragile as the flickering flames.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of Kryll pirates, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and her own unwavering determination.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying threats, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble on their survival and the future of humanity.
