
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and disease stalked the crowded towns.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for supplies in unfamiliar dialects, and facing the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the exotic East, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and wonders, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony for humanity.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, a vast ocean of interstellar space punctuated by the occasional jump through a wormhole.  The risks were different, but no less daunting:  malfunctioning hyperdrives, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation. Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting unknown worlds and expanding human civilization, fueled her unwavering resolve.
