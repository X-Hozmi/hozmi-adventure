
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a perilous journey across the Spine of the World mountains promising both untold riches and certain death.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation stalked his every step, but the whispers of Eldoria's magical artifacts fueled his courage.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat or a sign of the fantastical wonders that lay just beyond the next ridge.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna, and guarded by a hostile alien civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and outsmarting bureaucratic red tape were all in a day's work for Eva, but the lure of the Keplerian energy, potentially capable of solving Earth's energy crisis, made the unimaginable risks worthwhile. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, offered a different kind of adventure, one that traded bandits for alien weaponry, and mountains for nebulae.
