
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mocking his weary steed.  Weeks had bled into months since he left his homeland, a quest for the mythical Sunstone driving him onward.  He'd faced bandits, braved treacherous mountain passes, and bartered with suspicious merchants, all for a glimmer of the legendary gem's power.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast distance still to travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant, comforting thrum against the infinite blackness outside.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a whisper of a civilization swallowed by the cosmic expanse.  Years stretched into decades during the interstellar voyage, punctuated by the repairs of micrometeor damage and the routine calibrations of the warp engines.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space offered breathtaking beauty, a stark counterpoint to the gnawing loneliness of deep-space travel.
