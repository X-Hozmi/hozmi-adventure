The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the coast I'd left behind weeks ago.  My quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for my ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the hope that fueled my weary journey across the unforgiving landscape of the medieval world.


Conversely,  the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we leaped across the vast chasm of interstellar space.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport, each a cosmic masterpiece, were a stark reminder of the immeasurable distances we traversed. My mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. While the challenges were different – navigating asteroid fields, repairing critical systems, and the ever-present threat of unknown space-borne anomalies – the driving force remained the same:  the insatiable human desire to explore the unknown, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
