
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices, a fortune to be delivered to the bustling port city of Venice, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, disease stalked the travellers, and the very terrain – treacherous mountains and rushing rivers – threatened to swallow him whole.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, a new brush with fate in this grand adventure across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable power rumored to reside on a remote, uncharted planet.  Faster-than-light travel was still a marvel, and the dangers were just as real, if not more so:  rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failures.  This intergalactic voyage pushed the boundaries of human exploration, demanding skill, courage, and unwavering hope in the face of the unknown.
