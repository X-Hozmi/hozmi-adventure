
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy lanes of York, a seemingly endless string of  cart ruts and rutted tracks stretching before us.  Each sunrise brought a new vista: rolling hills giving way to dense forests, then craggy mountains that clawed at the sky.  We faced down brigands in shadowed valleys, bartered for meager supplies in dusty villages clinging to the edges of civilization, and slept under a canopy of stars, the silence broken only by the howl of wolves. Every step was a gamble, every mile a triumph against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship, carries us across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from our own.  Days melt into weeks, marked only by the changing nebulae outside our viewport and the rhythmic hum of the hyperdrive.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet promising untold discoveries.  The dangers are different now—solar flares, gravitational anomalies, and the unknown alien lifeforms that might await us—but the thrill of exploration, the intoxicating allure of the uncharted, remains the same unwavering force driving us forward.
