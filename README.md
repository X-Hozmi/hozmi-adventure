
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous – towering castles perched on jagged peaks, dark forests whispering with unseen dangers, and rivers swollen with spring melt. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.  Yet, the glint of hope, fuelled by the potential salvation of his people, kept him moving forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and battling the ever-present threat of space pirates, she relied on her wits, her crew's loyalty, and the cutting-edge technology of her vessel. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying – a constant reminder of the immensity of her task and the fragility of life amongst the stars.
