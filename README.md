
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a King's ransom in spices, a perilous cargo that demanded a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk cry, heightened the sense of adventure, a thrilling gamble against the unknown, a test of her courage and skill.  Her destination, the bustling port city of Constantinople, felt as distant and fantastical as a dream.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating through asteroid fields and nebulas, she and her crew faced dangers far beyond bandits and disease – rogue planets, hostile alien life forms, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace. The destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The thrill of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of uncharted worlds, and the sheer audacity of interstellar exploration fuelled their quest, a journey that dwarfed even the most ambitious medieval expedition.
