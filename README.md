
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky Breton landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the smooth, well-trodden path of the wealthy.  She'd faced bandits in the shadowed forests, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and bartered for meager meals in crumbling villages.  Each hardship was a testament to her unwavering spirit, a step closer to her sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a breathtaking cosmic ballet of purples, pinks and golds, were a far cry from the harsh realities of intergalactic travel.  Warp jumps between galaxies were treacherous, fraught with the risk of spatial anomalies and pirate attacks. Yet, Ryla, driven by the promise of a legendary lost artifact on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, pressed onward, her resolve as unwavering as Elara's had been centuries before, a testament to the enduring human spirit of exploration.
