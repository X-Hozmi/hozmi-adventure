
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara's caravan lumbered onward, its wheels groaning a mournful song against the rutted track.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone city rumored to hold the cure for a devastating plague, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease hung heavier than the dust clouds kicked up by their weary beasts.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the human cruelty that mirrored its harshness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, orbiting a dying red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates were routine, but the true danger lay in the unstable wormhole they were forced to traverse – a shortcut that threatened to tear their ship apart. The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own brand of adventure, as perilous and exhilarating as any medieval quest.
