
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the English countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and salvation – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the plague itself forming a tapestry of adventure woven into the very fabric of his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace;  the true adventure lay in the unknown – the possibility of discovering new life, encountering alien civilizations, or perhaps uncovering secrets that could reshape the understanding of the universe itself.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with stars, was both a terrifying and thrilling frontier.
