
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with the camaraderie of fellow travelers, the fear of bandit raids, and the awe-inspiring vastness of the unexplored landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of his ambition, kept him pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly across the lightyears.  The journey was measured not in days, but in parsecs, each jump a gamble against unpredictable space-time anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of rediscovering lost human heritage, a chance to unravel the mysteries of a vanished civilization, fueled her resolve as she navigated the cosmic ocean, a lone explorer charting the uncharted territories of the universe.
