
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit lords lurked in the shadowed forests,  disease stalked the crowded towns, and the sheer distance across the continent stretched before him like an insurmountable obstacle. Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the exotic East, the promise of riches and adventure, fueled his weary legs and spurred him onward.


Centuries later, Elara stood on the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*, the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy shimmering before her.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets lightyears apart.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but navigating the unpredictable wormholes and avoiding pirate fleets made each jump a gamble.  The alien landscapes of each world – volcanic moons, ice planets with bioluminescent flora, and gravity-defying nebulae – promised both wonder and danger. Elara, a seasoned explorer, knew the vastness of space held mysteries far greater than any medieval kingdom ever could.
