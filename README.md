
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road clung to everything, coating his throat with grit as he navigated the treacherous passes of the Pyrenees.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, whispered rumors of war echoed from distant villages, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, propelled him forward, each creak of saddle leather a testament to his unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Navigation was a constant battle against stellar anomalies and unpredictable gravitational forces.  The threat of pirate raiders and malfunctioning warp drives was a familiar companion, yet the promise of discovery, of establishing a new human foothold amongst the stars, outweighed every peril.  The journey was arduous, but the cosmos beckoned.
