
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope that the whispered legends might prove true.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope*, lost amongst the uncharted star clusters near the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space was a different kind of wilderness, one filled with gravitational anomalies, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But fueled by hope and advanced technology, Elara navigated the cosmic expanse, her every jump a gamble, her ultimate goal the safe return of lost souls to a waiting galaxy.
