
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry or worse – the plague whispered on the wind like a phantom.  Her quest: to reach Avignon, bearing a vital message for the Pope, a journey fraught with peril, where every sunrise brought the uncertain promise of survival, and every nightfall the looming threat of the unknown.  The rough-hewn roads were her only guide, the stars her only comfort in the vast, dangerous expanse of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a region teeming with alien lifeforms, both benevolent and hostile.  Faster-than-light travel masked the true length of their journey, but the isolation was profound.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulas and celestial bodies, held wonders beyond imagining, but also harbored threats far more insidious than any medieval bandit.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the enigmatic expanse of the unexplored universe.
