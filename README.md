
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travellers, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mimicking the swirling anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, sparks a fresh wave of apprehension – bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving desert itself are constant threats. Yet, the lure of Samarkand's silks, spices, and untold riches fuels our onward journey, a gamble against the capriciousness of fate and the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky black, its hyperdrive a low hum against the silence of interstellar space.  Captain Elara Jax navigates by the faint glimmers of distant nebulae, her course charted through wormholes and perilous asteroid fields towards Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, rogue space pirates, and the unknown vastness of the galaxy – the thrill of the unknown, the siren call of discovery, echoes the same primal urge that drove medieval adventurers across the lands.  The only difference is the scale: this is not a journey across a continent, but across the cosmos.
