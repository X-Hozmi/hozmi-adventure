
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under the pale sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through a forest thick with ancient oaks, each twist and turn promising both peril and reward.  He carried a King's writ, a mission to secure a vital alliance, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the possibility of encountering a new kingdom, a new culture, a new challenge – or a new grave.  The adventure was perilous, yet the lure of the unknown propelled him forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a previously unmapped sector of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational pulls, and facing the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms,  Eva embraced the challenge. The vastness of space, however terrifying, offered the greatest adventure imaginable, a journey to find a new home amongst the stars.
