
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, haunted forests teeming with brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, propelled him forward, each sunrise a promise of new dangers and unexpected allies along the arduous path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, the ship a fragile speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  Ahead lay uncharted star systems, perilous asteroid fields, and the chilling possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  But the weight of responsibility, the hope of rescue, and the endless expanse of the cosmos fueled her onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the boundless unknown.
