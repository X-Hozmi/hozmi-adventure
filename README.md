
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack, but the desperate hope fueled his onward journey across the treacherous landscape.  He travelled through dark forests, past crumbling castles, and across unforgiving mountains, relying on the kindness of strangers and the strength of his own resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate ships that preyed on intergalactic trade routes, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms demanded unwavering skill and courage.  Yet, the thought of the colonists' desperate need, of the life she could save, pushed her onward through the inky blackness between stars, a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the vast unknown.
