
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But Elara pressed on, her spirit fueled by hope and the whispered legends of lost cities and ancient magic. The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a search for salvation.


Thousands of years later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  Navigation involved charting wormholes and dodging asteroid fields, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. But the allure of unlocking faster-than-light travel, and the potential to unlock the secrets of the galaxy, spurred Ryla and her crew onward, defying the cosmic odds in their pursuit of progress.
