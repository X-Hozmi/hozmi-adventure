
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, bounced against her hip.  This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far more perilous than any tale the wandering minstrels spun. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous trek across the continent. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated the treacherous nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of countless distant suns. Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The journey was fraught with danger, from rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, but the allure of Aethel and the hope it represented fueled her onward.
