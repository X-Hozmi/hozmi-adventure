
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the desolate landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking step of his horse, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the insidious touch of disease itself.  The journey was a gamble with death, a tapestry woven with hardship, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess a revolutionary energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vast, unforgiving expanse of space held far greater dangers than any medieval landscape.  The cosmic expanse promised unimaginable riches, but also held the potential for catastrophic failure, a lonely death amongst the silent stars.
