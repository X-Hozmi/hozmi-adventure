
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the sickness itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a gamble against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The vastness of space held its own perils – treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the universe's secrets, fuelled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
