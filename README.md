
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with forgotten magic, fueled her journey, a perilous trek through bandit-infested valleys and scorching deserts. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for adventure – or death.  The promise of discovery, however, eclipsed her fears, driving her onward towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy. His mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere, a megastructure capable of harnessing the energy of an entire star.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the dazzling brilliance of distant suns and the chilling darkness of unexplored regions, was a thrilling and terrifying landscape.  Each jump through hyperspace risked catastrophic failure, but the allure of the unknown, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, spurred him on.
