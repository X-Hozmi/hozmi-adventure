
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the dense forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, yet the burning hope of safety fueled her relentless stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching at the breathtaking spectacle of iridescent gases.  This wasn't a journey of mere survival, but of exploration; a mission to chart unmapped galaxies and seek out new habitable worlds for humanity's expanding reach.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, from navigating asteroid fields to the unpredictable behavior of wormholes.  Yet, for Eva, the greatest adventure wasn't conquering the physical challenges of interstellar travel, but the thrilling unknown that lay beyond the reach of known stars.
