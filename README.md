
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to immortality.  Each sunrise brought the peril of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, with every creaking step of his faithful beast, the lure of the unknown propelled him further, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of his journey.  The treasure sought was not just gold, but a lifetime lived beyond the limits of mortality.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, but the cosmos held dangers far beyond any medieval bandit: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling possibility of encountering something beyond human comprehension.  The weight of responsibility for her crew and the desperate hope of finding survivors fueled her, driving her across the vast, star-dusted canvas of the galaxy in a journey far more perilous, yet undeniably thrilling, than any tale of medieval exploration.
