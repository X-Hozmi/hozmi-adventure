
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous Alpine passes, her worn map clutched tight in her gloved hand.  The biting wind whips at her cloak, a stark contrast to the warmth of the sun-baked plains she left behind.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, holds the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of famine are constant companions on this perilous journey across the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, speckled with distant suns and swirling cosmic dust, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Advanced sensors constantly scan for asteroid fields and unfamiliar energy signatures, while the crew navigates treacherous wormholes and uncharted star systems.  The future holds untold wonders, but the journey between the stars demands courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.
