
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains, her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Forest do little to deter her quest for the legendary Sunstone.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat, but the promise of adventure, of uncovering ancient secrets, fuels her journey across the unforgiving landscape.  She travels with a small band of companions, each with their own skills and motivations, bound together by the allure of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Navigation charts pulse with holographic constellations, guiding her through nebulae and past dying suns.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers are far removed from bandits and forests; cosmic storms and rogue asteroids threaten to shatter her ship, while the vast, unknowable expanse of space presses in on her crew. But the promise of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of the universe, surpasses any fear.
