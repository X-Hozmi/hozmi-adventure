
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he navigates the treacherous, rutted track across the Black Forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the tension.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on his arduous journey, testing his courage and resilience as he pushes further into the unknown.  The promise of Eldoria, however, fuels his relentless march.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines of time and distance, but the dangers remain: rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien civilizations. The vast emptiness of space, however, is countered by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, reminding Eva of the immense scale of the universe and the thrilling, lonely majesty of her exploration.
