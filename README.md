
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the unforgiving plains, her meager pack heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs.  The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the already treacherous landscape into a shimmering mirage.  Her quest – to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother – felt as distant and unattainable as the shimmering peaks on the horizon.  Each creaking step was a gamble, a test against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the wild.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with fear, hope, and the grit of a woman determined to overcome impossible odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the threat of pirate fleets a constant shadow.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fueled her unwavering spirit, pushing her and her crew ever onward into the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
