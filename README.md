
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in fiery hues. Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and the parchment map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient healing secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse, yet the allure of the unknown propelled her forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Zydonian cruisers was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of intergalactic permits and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies. Yet, the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest mysteries spurred him onward, a solitary voyager amidst the infinite canvas of space.
