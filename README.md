
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, the scent of pine and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held her only possessions: a chipped map, a well-thumbed prayer book, and a meager supply of dried figs.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the mountains, and the whispers of a plague ravaged the lands she was crossing.  Yet, the promise of the fabled city of  Zarahemla, a jewel hidden beyond the peaks, fueled her onward, a beacon against the encroaching darkness. Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, a new challenge to her courage and resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The ship's AI, a wryly sarcastic program named HAL-E, warned of approaching asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, their trajectory a tightrope walk across the cosmic void.  Eva, hardened by years of navigating the galaxy's treacherous currents, relied on her intuition and the faint signals from the distant planet, a gamble that could either catapult humanity into a new era or leave her lost amongst the stars.
