
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band urged their mounts onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving steppe. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of ancient magic, spurred them onwards, their determination hardening with every mile.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and contending with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work.  But the thought of bringing life to a barren world, of expanding humanity's reach amongst the stars, fueled her courage and kept her hand steady on the controls.
