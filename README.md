
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for supplies in dusty villages, and dodging the suspicious glances of those who suspected him of harboring more than just a thirst for adventure. His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to the enduring human spirit in a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate raids.  Advanced technology offered a modicum of protection, but the vastness of space, the loneliness of interstellar travel, and the unknown dangers lurking in the darkness still held a primal fear.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, fueled by the hope of finding those lost colonists and unlocking the galaxy's deepest secrets.
