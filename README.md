
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her mule, laden with meager supplies, plodded onward, the distant, jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Rumours of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, spurred her on, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience – a true medieval adventure forged in grit and determination.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos illuminating the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with unpredictable warp storms and hostile alien encounters.  Jaxx gripped the controls, his heart pounding with anticipation and a healthy dose of fear; the vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to humanity’s ambition and a constant reminder of the precariousness of interstellar travel.
