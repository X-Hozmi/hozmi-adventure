
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles swallowed since leaving Canterbury.  The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a stark contrast to the rumours whispered around crackling fires – rumours of bandit kings in the Black Forest, of enchanted rivers, and of a lost city glittering with gold beyond the mountains.  My meagre supplies dwindled, but the thrill of the unknown, the pull of the legend, kept me moving westward, towards a destiny I couldn't yet fathom.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a new star in the tapestry of my adventure.


A thousand years hence, the Althea's hyperdrive hummed a steady, reassuring song as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside, a canvas of cosmic colours, paled in comparison to the thrill coursing through my veins.  We were explorers, charting unmapped territories among the stars, risking everything for a glimpse of the unknown. Each jump was a gamble, each planet a potential paradise or peril, but the universe beckoned, promising untold wonders and the chance to rewrite the history books of humankind, one daring leap at a time.
