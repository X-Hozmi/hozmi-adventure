
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant sultan.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk overhead, held the thrill and peril of the unknown. Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on her arduous journey, testing her courage and resilience with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a remote planet, a task fraught with the dangers of alien encounters and unpredictable spatial anomalies.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent, demanded unwavering skill and nerves of steel, a far cry from the dusty trails of Elara's time, but no less an adventure.
