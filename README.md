
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, to deliver a vital message to the Papal court, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, whispered tales of the Black Death clung to the air like a shroud, and the rough terrain tested both her resilience and her mount's.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a potent cocktail of fear and determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial bodies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raids from the Kryll Syndicate, and dealing with the persistent hum of the ship’s failing hyperdrive were all part of a typical interstellar voyage. Yet, the promise of discovery fueled her, a potent antidote to the lonely expanse of the cosmos.
