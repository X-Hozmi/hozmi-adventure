
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, testing her courage and resilience with each passing league.  Yet, the whispers of healing, carried on the wind, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula shimmering with impossible colors. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates was a daily struggle, demanding precise piloting and quick thinking.  But the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the mystery of Xylos's disappearance, kept her engines humming and her spirit soaring amongst the stars.
