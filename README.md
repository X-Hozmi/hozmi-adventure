
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the battlefield he'd left behind.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each flash of steel from a passing knight, held the promise of peril, but the hope of salvation spurred him on, a beacon guiding his journey across the treacherous landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The nebula outside shimmered in a thousand hues, a breathtaking vista that belied the perilous jump to the Xylos system.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from a newly discovered planet, a sample that could hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Cosmic rays crackled on the hull, a constant reminder of the vast, unpredictable nature of space.  But the promise of scientific advancement, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted cosmos, outweighed any fear.
