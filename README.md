
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, fording raging rivers, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the unwavering faith and the thrill of the journey itself fueled their resolve, pushing them ever closer to their sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the inherent dangers remained – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the chilling possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered both terrifying beauty and a boundless opportunity for discovery, testing the limits of human courage and ingenuity.
