
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital strains of wheat promised to revive a famine-stricken village.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rumors of a monstrous beast guarding a mountain pass fueled her nights with fear. Yet, the hope in her heart, a flickering flame against the vastness of the unknown, pushed her onward, each creak of her saddle a testament to her journey’s arduous beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the ice planet of Nird, a world veiled in swirling storms and rumored to house a powerful energy source.  The dangers were not earthly beasts, but rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirates, infamous for their ruthlessness and advanced weaponry.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable terror and untold wonders, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
