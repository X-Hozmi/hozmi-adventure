
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's pardon, a forged one at that, clutched tight in his saddlebag,  his only protection against the endless dangers of the road: bandits lurking in shadowed forests,  hostile lords demanding tolls, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-earned rest under a sky strewn with indifferent stars, a testament to the immense journey that lay between him and the promised sanctuary of the distant coast.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.   The hum of the hyperdrive masked the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel, a constant companion to the intrepid explorers charting the unmapped reaches of the galaxy. The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the risks—the unpredictable asteroid fields, the potential for encountering hostile alien civilizations, the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any help.  Her mission was a gamble, but the potential reward, a new home for humanity, was worth the unimaginable odds.
