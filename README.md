
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, far from the ravaged fields of her homeland. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both fear and the exhilarating thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on this journey across the continent, a pilgrimage fueled by desperation and a stubborn refusal to surrender to fate.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its sleek hull shimmering with captured starlight.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos system was child’s play compared to the political maelstrom awaiting her on the distant planet of Aethel.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but also endless dangers - pirate raids, rogue AI, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters. Yet, the promise of rare minerals and the allure of unexplored worlds spurred her onward, a lone voyager charting a course through the infinite tapestry of space.
