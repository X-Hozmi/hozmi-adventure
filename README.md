
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees shimmering in the afternoon sun. Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of finding her brother in the distant city of Avignon.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the whisper of adventure, the promise of reunion, kept her spurred onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with perils; asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels all loomed. But Ava, fuelled by the thrill of exploration and the ambition of charting new frontiers, navigated the vast expanse of the cosmos, her heart pounding with the exhilarating rhythm of interstellar adventure.
