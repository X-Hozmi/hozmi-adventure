
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, pressed onward. The parchment clutched in his gauntlet promised riches beyond imagining, hidden somewhere in the treacherous Black Forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of the unknown lurked around every bend in the ancient track.  His journey was a tapestry woven with peril and the tantalizing thread of hope, a true medieval adventure across uncharted lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and contending with the unpredictable whims of warp-drive technology were all in a day's work for a galaxy-hopping adventurer like Eva, whose journey represented a very different, but equally perilous, quest for new frontiers.
