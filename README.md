
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy City, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce supplies in isolated villages, and constantly guarding against the unpredictable whims of nature and the even more unpredictable nature of men.  Their quest was not for gold or glory, but for faith and redemption, earned through hardship and tested by the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light-years of interstellar space.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't just a physical one; it was a test of engineering, resilience, and the human spirit's boundless curiosity.  Facing asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravitational wells, and contending with the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic phenomena, Elara and her crew pressed on, driven by the hope of discovery and the promise of a new beginning among the distant stars.
