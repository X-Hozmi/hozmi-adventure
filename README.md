
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the fire in her heart, fueled by the need to save her people, pushed her onward through the relentless sun and chilling nights.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, had been fraught with peril; asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of a new beginning, a chance to escape the overcrowded, resource-depleted Earth, fueled her crew's unwavering determination. The vast emptiness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, yet the promise of a new dawn propelled them forward.
