
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Bruges, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps, a path fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the promise of breathtaking vistas – sun-drenched valleys, majestic peaks piercing the clouds – but also the gnawing fear of the unknown, the constant need to rely on the strength of our companions and the unpredictable whims of fate. We sought not gold, but knowledge, hoping to find the lost library of Alexandria rumored to be hidden somewhere in the Eastern empire.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway. The Althea, a sleek starship shimmering under a nebula's vibrant hues, carried us across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos planet, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond even the capabilities of our advanced technology. Each jump through hyperspace brought with it a thrilling gamble, the possibility of encountering unforeseen celestial events or hostile alien races. Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the cosmos, fueled our courage and propelled us further into the uncharted territories of space.
