
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – and the thrill of the unknown, a journey testing her courage and resilience as much as her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Kestrel navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The mission: a perilous extraction from a volatile mining colony on the planet Kepler-186f, light years from Earth.  Facing asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure, Nova's adventure was one of cutting-edge technology and calculated risk, a dance between human ingenuity and the awesome, unpredictable power of the cosmos.
