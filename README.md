
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the unknown fueled his determination, pushing him further into the heart of the unexplored wilderness.  The rough-hewn map clutched in his hand, stained with sweat and rain, was his only guide.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting the cockpit in an ethereal glow. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a potential haven or a deadly trap.  But the spirit of exploration, echoing through generations of starfarers, burned bright within her, urging her to press on into the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
