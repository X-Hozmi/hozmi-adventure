
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone Shrine, had already tested their mettle against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a ford to cross, a forest to navigate, a crumbling castle to avoid. Their pack animals, weary but resolute, carried their meager supplies, a constant reminder of the fragility of life on this unforgiving journey.  The whispered legends of the shrine fueled their determination, promising power and healing if only they could reach their destination.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way, her crew a diverse team bound together by a shared thirst for discovery.  Their mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole network, potentially unlocking faster-than-light travel across unimaginable distances.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding hostile alien patrols, and battling the relentless wear and tear of interstellar travel were commonplace hazards. Yet, the promise of uncovering new worlds, new civilizations, and the very edge of the universe propelled them forward, their course set against the breathtaking backdrop of a million shimmering stars.
