
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Gareth, his armour clanking with every step, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land was proving far more treacherous than any battlefield.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any Saracen.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim satisfaction of having survived another day in this relentless test of endurance and will.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, yet the journey between galaxies was far from effortless.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, evading pirate factions lurking in the shadowed reaches of space, and the constant threat of engine failure tested her crew's skills and courage to their limits.  The reward, however – a legendary artifact hidden on a remote planet – made the unimaginable risks worthwhile.
