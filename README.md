
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies – it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the ever-present danger: bandits, wild beasts, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown stretched before her like the endless trail itself.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with peril and purpose, a testament to the human spirit's enduring quest for salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar immortality.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Razor felt the familiar thrill of the void – a dance with death among the stars.  This was not just a scientific expedition; it was a gamble on humanity's future, a voyage into the unfathomable depths of space, where the reward, like the risk, knew no bounds.
