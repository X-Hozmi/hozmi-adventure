
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the scent of pine and damp earth filling her lungs.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in hushed tones at taverns across the land.  Her journey had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain trails, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of gold promised by Zerzura, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled her onward, each sunrise a new chapter in her perilous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine for Ryla, yet the thrill of exploration never waned.  Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of discovery – new life, strange landscapes, and the unending mysteries of the cosmos.
