
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward through the harsh, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to establish a vital hyperspace relay station on the edge of unexplored territory.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable effects of warp drive were commonplace hazards.  The loneliness of deep space pressed upon her crew, a stark contrast to the bustling spaceports they occasionally visited, yet the allure of discovery and the promise of a new era for humankind fueled their tireless journey across the cosmos.
