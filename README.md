
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling emptiness of the vast unknown.  Her journey was a desperate gamble, a race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* sliced through the nebula, its engines humming a low, powerful song.  Beyond the viewport stretched a breathtaking vista of swirling gases and distant galaxies, each a potential destination, each a potential discovery.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space held its own terrors, from rogue asteroids to unforeseen cosmic phenomena, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration, outweighed all fear.
