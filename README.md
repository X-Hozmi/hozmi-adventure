
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold healing powers, had taken her through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and through whispering forests where ancient magic still lingered.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience, fueling her onward toward her uncertain, but deeply hoped-for, destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane-rich planet of Kepler-186f, a journey fraught with the perils of unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any known civilization.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, was a constant companion on this perilous, intergalactic expedition.
