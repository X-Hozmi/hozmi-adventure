
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the dusty road a fiery orange.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagon, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry or worse.  We pressed on, driven by the legend of a lost city rumored to hold unimaginable treasures – a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, where a stumble could mean starvation, and a wrong turn, death.  Our only companions were the whispering wind and the ever-present threat of the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The sleek, chrome hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' sliced through the inky void, its destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebulae outside the cockpit, navigated through asteroid fields and wormholes, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of interstellar space.  The thrill of discovery fueled her crew, but the weight of responsibility – the potential for disaster lurking in the unexplored corners of the galaxy – kept them ever vigilant.
