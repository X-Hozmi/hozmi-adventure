
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped compass, a few dried figs, and a map older than her grandfather.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Ys, whispered to be lost beneath the waves, a pilgrimage fueled by both desperate hope and a thirst for the unknown. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor obstacles on her quest for a legendary healing herb, a gamble against the encroaching darkness of the plague.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts were flickering projections, alien nebulae painted vibrant tapestries across the viewport.  The danger wasn't brigands or disease, but unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of encountering technologies beyond human comprehension.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of a future unbound by the limitations of space and time, spurred Ryla onward.
