
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a perilous path to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the whispered promise of unimaginable riches and lost knowledge fuels her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields is commonplace, but the thrill of exploration never fades.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of bridging the vast chasm between galaxies.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the scale of her adventure and the immense risks involved in this grand interstellar quest.
