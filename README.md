
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the crisp autumn air.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from over; whispers of a lost city, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward despite the lurking dangers – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each winding path, each towering peak, represented a challenge overcome, a testament to her courage and resilience in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust Drifter* cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes was commonplace, a daily dance with the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to harbor a life-sustaining element vital to humanity’s survival.   The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril than Elara's mountains, but the lure of discovery, the promise of a future secured, propelled Ryla and her crew ever onward through the inky black.
