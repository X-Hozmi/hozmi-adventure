
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful baron and a promise whispered on the wind of a monastery hidden somewhere beyond the treacherous Black Forest. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril, from brigands to wild animals, but the relentless rhythm of her journey fueled her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy, rumored to exist on a remote, uncharted planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of dying stars was child's play compared to the potential political ramifications of such a discovery, but the thrill of exploration, of venturing into the unknown expanse of the galaxy, far outweighed any risk.
