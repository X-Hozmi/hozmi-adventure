
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation – and unexpected discovery, the kindness of a stranger, the breathtaking vista from a windswept hilltop. The journey itself was as crucial as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova'  Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with the dangers of spatial anomalies and pirate raids, but the allure of finding a new home for her people,  a lost civilization's secrets, and unexplored planets teeming with alien life, far outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space held a promise of wonder, as boundless and perilous as the medieval world's.
