
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, each weary mile a testament to her resilience and the unwavering faith that guided her steps.  The medieval world was a tapestry of breathtaking beauty and unimaginable hardship, woven together by the thread of relentless adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the opportunistic raids of space pirates were just another Tuesday for Rexx. The vastness of space held both incredible wonder and terrifying unknowns.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, but the promise of discovery, of finding new life and new worlds, fueled his insatiable thirst for adventure among the stars.
