The sun beat down on the travelers, a motley crew of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, each with their own reasons for venturing beyond the safety of their village walls.

With their hearts filled with curiosity and a thirst for the unknown, they embarked on a journey that would forever alter their understanding of the universe and their place within it.
