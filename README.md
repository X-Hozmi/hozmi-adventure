
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step of her mount was a gamble against bandits, treacherous paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The journey was a tapestry woven with breathtaking vistas, chilling encounters, and the unwavering determination fueling her every stride.

Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to a newly discovered planet, a world teeming with potential but also rife with unpredictable cosmic phenomena.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll Empire, she relied on her crew's skill and the cutting-edge technology of the *Stardust* to reach their destination, facing dangers far beyond the limitations of any medieval journey.
