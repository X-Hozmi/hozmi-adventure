
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the fading sunlight, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through a dense forest, shadows lengthening into menacing claws. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed land stretching before him, filled with bandits, beasts, and the unknown.  Survival depended not just on his sword arm but on his cunning and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace. Advanced technology offered a measure of safety, but the vastness of space, the crushing loneliness, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters made this interstellar voyage as daunting and unpredictable as any medieval expedition.
