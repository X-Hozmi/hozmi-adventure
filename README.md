
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the lost scroll of El Cid, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both rider and beast tumbling into the abyss, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion.  But the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends, fueled her onward, a relentless pulse against the rhythm of the mule's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Sparks' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent crystal from the uncharted planet of Aethel, a jewel said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense; hostile alien life forms, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders stalked the star lanes. Yet, the vastness of space, the promise of discovery, and the allure of scientific advancement pushed Valerius and her crew deeper into the cosmic unknown, their hearts pounding with a different kind of medieval-esque bravery.
