
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Their destination: the fabled city of Constantinople, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Every creak of the cart wheels, every rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for adventure – or disaster – as their journey unfolded amidst the brutality and beauty of a medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst colossal cosmic wonders.  He was on a decades-long mission to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking with the ever-present risk of encountering unknown sentient life, hostile space anomalies, and the relentless strain of interstellar travel.  Each jump through hyperspace offered the exhilarating thrill of discovery, punctuated by the quiet fear of the unknown depths of space.
