
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a chipped map, its edges frayed from countless miles traversed, leading her towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her quest, a perilous journey fueled by whispers of ancient magic and untold riches.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the bittersweet beauty of a hard-won day's travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  His mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of Xylanium to the distant Kepler-186f colony, a planet teeming with life but desperately short on resources.  Hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of space pirates made this intergalactic trade run far more dangerous than any medieval caravan route.  Yet, the thrill of exploring the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant stars, kept Razor pushing ever onward, toward the next destination in his unending cosmic odyssey.
