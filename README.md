
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the last surviving manuscript of a lost alchemist, a text rumored to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were merely obstacles on her perilous journey to the monastery at Cluny, her only hope of deciphering the arcane text and achieving her desperate goal. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, testing her resilience and pushing her closer to her ultimate fate.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the newly constructed hyperspace gate, a component stranded on the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with hostile Kryll creatures and unpredictable weather patterns.  The journey wasn't simply a matter of spatial displacement; it was a calculated dance through gravitational fields, asteroid belts, and the ever-present danger of encountering pirate factions.  The stakes were high, not just for the galaxy's future, but for Ryla's own survival.
