
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Eadmund, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the constant threat of wild animals. But the promise of divine grace, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, their weary bodies fueled by hope and a shared thirst for adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across a dozen planets in three different galaxies.  Navigation was treacherous, requiring precise calculations and a keen eye for celestial anomalies.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the void.  But the possibility of finding the lost colonists, of uncovering their fate, kept the crew of the 'Stardust Wanderer' pushing forward, their courage tempered by the vast, unforgiving beauty of the cosmos.
