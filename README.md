
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a King's writ, a precarious mission across the treacherous highlands separating kingdoms.  Bandit raids, impassable rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the unknown perils of the road.  The reward, the King's favour and potentially a fortune, felt increasingly distant with each passing league.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a perilous voyage through unmapped wormholes and asteroid fields.  The ship’s AI, HALIX, hummed with warnings of gravitational anomalies and potential encounters with unknown lifeforms.  While lacking the immediate, visceral dangers of Thomas's medieval trek, Eva faced her own brand of existential dread; the vastness of space, the isolation, and the sheer improbability of rescue if something went wrong.
