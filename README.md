
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Yet, the lure of salvation fueled her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast, indifferent darkness of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, his starship cutting a silent path through swirling cosmic dust.  His mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining crystals to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and pirate incursions a constant threat.  But the weight of responsibility, the hope entrusted to him by millions light-years away, propelled him forward, a lone voyager charting a course through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
