
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies, chafes against her shoulders, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Each creak of her saddlebag holds the promise of discovery, of encountering forgotten cities and mythical creatures, but also the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present uncertainty of the unknown trails leading her towards the fabled city of Zerzura.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating by constellations unknown to Earth's cartographers, her crew charts a course through nebulae painted in vibrant colours unseen on any terrestrial canvas. The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby against the vast emptiness, a comforting counterpoint to the thrill of exploring uncharted worlds brimming with alien life, both breathtaking and potentially deadly.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the infinite possibilities and unimaginable dangers of the cosmos.
