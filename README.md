
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his mule laden with meager supplies.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brings new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, outweighs the hardships.  Each sunrise fuels his determination to conquer the vast expanse that separates him from his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Warp drives hum, gravity shifts unsettlingly, and the vast, unknowable emptiness of space presses in.  But Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, faces the void with unwavering courage, driven by the hope of rescue and the unwavering belief in humanity's capacity to overcome even the most daunting challenges of the cosmos.
