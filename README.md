
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the mountains. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey, but the lure of a better future fuels her unwavering spirit, each step a testament to her courage and resilience.  She dreams of green fields, a far cry from the drought-stricken village she left behind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a dwindling human population.  Navigating nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids is commonplace, but the true adventure lies in the uncharted territories.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where alien civilizations, both benevolent and hostile, might await. The weight of humanity's future rests on her shoulders, a burden she carries with the unwavering determination of a pioneer forging a path among the stars.
