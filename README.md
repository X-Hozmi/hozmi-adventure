
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping at my cloak as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each step was a gamble against frostbite and bandits, the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria a flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving darkness.  My meager supplies dwindled with every crest conquered, but the whispers of Eldoria's untold riches and ancient magic spurred me onward, a solitary figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars blurred into streaks of light outside my viewport as we jumped towards the Xylos system, a perilous journey across uncharted space.  The risk of encountering rogue asteroids or, worse, hostile Xylossian warships, was ever-present, but the lure of the legendary Crystal Nebula and its potential for revolutionary energy sources outweighed the danger.  My crew, a ragtag band of explorers, held fast, our hope a bright flame against the endless black.
