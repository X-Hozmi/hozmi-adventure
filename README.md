
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges:  fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous passes guarded by wolves larger than any I’d ever seen, and bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages clinging to the mountainside.  The destination?  The mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  The journey was far more perilous than the tales had suggested, but the thrill of the unknown, the constant test of survival, kept me pushing onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the vast, star-dusted void.  My destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, though far less physically demanding than my medieval ancestor’s, held a different kind of terror – the isolating vastness of space, the constant threat of system malfunctions, and the unknown dangers lurking on a planet teeming with life utterly unlike our own.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of encountering a civilization unlike any humanity had ever known, ignited a similar spark of adventure, a burning desire to push the boundaries of the known universe.
