
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the unforgiving terrain, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin. Her journey from Canterbury to Rome was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance, but the burning hope of finding her brother fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the vastness of the medieval world.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offered fleeting comfort, a momentary reprieve before the endless road stretched ahead once more.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to chart unmapped galaxies and search for habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vast distances between star systems were a constant challenge, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and cosmic storms. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the sheer wonder of encountering alien life forms and landscapes beyond human comprehension, drove her and her crew onwards, pushing the boundaries of exploration into the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
