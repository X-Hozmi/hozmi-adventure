
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown fueled his weary steps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista of rugged beauty, a new test of his resilience on this arduous pilgrimage across the heart of Europe and into the mysterious East.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations in conventional drives.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and wrestling with the capricious whims of hyperspace were commonplace hazards. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the hope of discovering new life and unlocking the universe's mysteries, outweighed the risks, driving Elara and her crew ever deeper into the cosmic ocean,  toward the uncharted expanse of a galaxy far, far away.
