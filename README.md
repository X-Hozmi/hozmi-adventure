
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward. The dust of the King's Road swirled behind them, a hazy brown tail marking their passage across the blistered landscape of Aquitaine.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring rains, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest, where whispers of bandits and wilder beasts kept even the bravest knight on edge.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of the hyperdrive, the crackle of comms chatter, and the ever-present threat of space debris.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets tested her skill and nerve, but the lure of discovery, the hope of finding life beyond Earth, propelled her forward, a tiny ship against the immensity of the cosmos.
