
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, a far cry from the manicured gardens of his lord’s manor.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Jude, rumored to be hidden within the treacherous Black Mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and adventure, a symphony of anticipation for what lay beyond the next bend in the trail.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself were all potential foes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare isotope vital to sustaining life on her colonized world.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unknown planets was a daily challenge.  The vast, inky expanse of space held both wonder and unimaginable danger,  a stark contrast to the familiar green fields of her home.  Communication with Earth was intermittent, and the burden of her responsibility weighed heavily as she pushed the limits of human exploration into the uncharted depths of the galaxy.
