
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the far more terrifying prospect of the Black Death. Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery at the mountain's peak, was fueled by a desperate hope and a stubborn will, pushing her further into the untamed wilderness where legends and reality blurred. The journey tested her spirit and body, a constant battle against the elements and the ever-present danger lurking just beyond the next bend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace, but the allure of the unknown, the chance to uncover a civilization unlike any before, outweighed the risk.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the boundless possibilities that lay hidden amongst the stars.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a thrilling gamble in the grand cosmic lottery.
