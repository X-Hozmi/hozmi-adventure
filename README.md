
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Carcassonne.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of life on this arduous journey. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages, all while relying on her wits and the unwavering loyalty of her trusty steed.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, and potentially hostile, life forms.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, fraught with the possibility of encountering spatial anomalies or pirate fleets.  Days blurred into weeks under the constant hum of the ship's engines, punctuated by the hiss of oxygen recyclers and the crackling static of long-range comms.  The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and terror, as Ryla navigated the cosmic currents toward her distant, icy objective.
