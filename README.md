
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, precious seed – the last of its kind, said to bloom only in the mythical valley of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are mere inconveniences compared to the mission that fuels her relentless journey; a quest whispered only amongst the elders, a quest for survival itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion as she navigates asteroid fields and nebulae of breathtaking beauty, the vastness of space both terrifying and awe-inspiring.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, face the challenges of alien environments, technological malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, driven by a shared desire to expand humanity's reach across the galaxy, to chart new worlds and find a new home among the stars.
