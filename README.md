The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering mountains loomed in the distance, their peaks shrouded in mist, while the immediate path was littered with the bones of less fortunate travelers.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, fueled a potent mix of fear and exhilaration.
