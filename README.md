
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the holy city a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.  The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the raw beauty of the untamed world made the hardship worthwhile.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a marathon, not a sprint, spanning generations of crew.  While cryo-sleep mitigated the passage of time, the challenges were immense – navigating asteroid fields, repairing critical systems amidst the void's unforgiving expanse, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and hostile alien civilizations. Yet the promise of discovery, the allure of new worlds and their potential, fuelled the crew's dedication. The vastness of space, though daunting, held a majesty that mirrored the medieval traveler's awe before the untamed earth.
