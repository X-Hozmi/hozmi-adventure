
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired mare onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones at taverns across the land.  He carried with him little more than a worn map, a waterskin dwindling faster than his hope, and a fierce determination to uncover the truth behind the legend – a truth that might bring him fortune, or death in the unforgiving desert.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of the wind, felt like a challenge, a testament to the raw, untamed adventure of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to establish contact with the Xylos civilization on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy – a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  While lacking the immediate physical perils of Thomas's journey, Elara faced the constant threat of warp-core failure, hostile alien encounters, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the breathtaking vistas of nebulas and distant galaxies fueled her drive, making her journey a cosmic adventure of equal magnitude.
