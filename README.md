
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  He carried only a worn map, a few meager coins, and the unwavering hope that fueled his arduous journey across the treacherous landscapes of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and treacherous wormholes was a daily routine, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of their isolation.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders and the shared camaraderie of her crew spurred them onward, a testament to humanity's indomitable spirit pushing the boundaries of interstellar exploration.
