
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll – a map promising the legendary Sunstone hidden within a forgotten monastery nestled high in the Alps.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandit attack or worse – the whispers of the Black Death stalked the land as relentlessly as Elara stalked her prize.  Every mile was a gamble, a test of endurance against both nature and man.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth, was fraught with perils unseen by medieval travelers: asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids from the Kryll Syndicate.  Jax, fuelled by the hope of finding a new home for humanity, held fast to her course, each hyperspace jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
