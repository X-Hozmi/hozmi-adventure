
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse, a sturdy grey mare named Storm, picked its way through the treacherous pass.  Their journey from York to Constantinople was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara pressed onward, driven by the whispered promise of silks, spices, and the legendary lost city of Zerzura, a quest fuelled by ancient maps and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of a thousand suns.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a calculated risk, a mission to retrieve a vital energy source before the K'tharr Empire could claim it for themselves.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested the crew's skills and courage.  But Eva, fueled by unwavering loyalty and a deep sense of responsibility, steered her ship toward the unknown, knowing the fate of her people rested on her shoulders.
