
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the Black Forest, its shadowy depths whispering tales of brigands and mythical beasts.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him. His quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Lord Elmsworth – was a race against time and the elements, a true test of endurance and courage in a world where every journey held the potential for peril and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through a nebula shimmering with impossible colours. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reminder of the vast distances separating humanity from its next frontier.  While danger still lurked – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – the scale of the adventure transcended anything imaginable in the medieval age.  It was a journey not just across space, but into the very unknown.
