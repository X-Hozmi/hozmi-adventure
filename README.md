Dust billowed behind them as the small caravan snaked its way across the unforgiving plains, the distant jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the scale of her adventure, a journey that could bring either untold scientific discovery or complete annihilation.
