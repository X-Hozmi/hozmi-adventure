
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creaking wagon wheel and the braying of her stubborn mount marked another mile closer to the rumored city of Eldoria, a mythical place whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward fueled her onward, one treacherous step at a time.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter' as it jumped through hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind. His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last remaining samples of the Xylanian flower, a plant capable of reversing the effects of the Kryll plague that ravaged his homeworld.  The cosmos held infinite wonders, but also infinite dangers; asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable whims of warp travel were constant companions.  The journey promised riches beyond measure, but the risk of failure – and annihilation – hung heavy in the air.
