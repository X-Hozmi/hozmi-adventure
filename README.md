
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked its way across the dusty Provençal plains, then into the unforgiving foothills of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred us onward, fueled by whispered tales of exotic spices and ancient cities beyond the horizon.


Centuries later, the star drive hummed a low, constant thrum as our vessel, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Cygnus X-1 region demanded unwavering focus and precision, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of space-time.   The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet promising untold wonders and the possibility of discovering life beyond our own.  The vastness of space, terrifying yet breathtaking, dwarfed our concerns as we embarked on this, the greatest adventure humankind had yet undertaken.
