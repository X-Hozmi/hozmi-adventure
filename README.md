
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track wound through the dense Black Forest, shadows lengthening as twilight descended.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland –  was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by desperate prayer and the unwavering loyalty of his squire, pushed him further into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, whispers of their advanced technology a beacon in the vast emptiness. Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, wormhole instability a constant worry.  But Eva, steeled by years of intergalactic exploration, faced the cosmic unknown with unwavering determination, her crew's lives and the fate of a civilization resting on her skill and courage.
