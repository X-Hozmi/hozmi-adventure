
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward through the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Warp jumps risked tearing the ship apart, asteroid fields were a constant threat, and the vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the cold, distant starlight, tested the crew's endurance.  But the hope of finding the colonists, and the thrill of galactic exploration, fueled their relentless journey across the cosmos.
