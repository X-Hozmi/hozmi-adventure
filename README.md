
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of a legendary lost city nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her fear and her unwavering determination. Bandits, starvation, and the treacherous terrain itself were constant threats, but the lure of the unknown was stronger than any peril.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's shimmering veil.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey had already taken years, each jump across the vast interstellar gulf fraught with the risk of encountering rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, or hostile alien patrols.  But the potential rewards - unlocking galactic exploration and securing humanity's future amongst the stars - made the perilous voyage worthwhile.  The cosmos was a vast and unforgiving ocean, but Ryla, like Elara before her, was ready to navigate its treacherous currents.
