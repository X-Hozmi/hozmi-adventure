
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she crests the windswept hill, the vast, untamed landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – precious seeds of a new, drought-resistant grain, destined for a monastery far across the kingdom.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of illness are but a few of the perils that stand between her and her goal, each day a gamble against the unforgiving elements and the unpredictable nature of man.  Her journey is a testament to human resilience, a pilgrimage fueled by hope and the quiet dignity of purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, a rumored nexus of untold galactic power.  Warp jumps through treacherous wormholes, encounters with unknown sentient life forms, and the constant hum of the ship's engines are the daily reality for Ryla and her crew.  The vast distances and unimaginable wonders of space dwarf even the grandest medieval expeditions, making each interstellar voyage a thrilling odyssey into the uncharted territories of the universe.
