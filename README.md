
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cacophony of hawkers and the stench of unwashed bodies fading behind us as we set off east.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the rhythmic clop of our horses' hooves on cobblestone and dirt tracks. We traversed rolling hills, crossed treacherous rivers on rickety bridges, and navigated forests thick with bandits and whispering secrets.  Each sunset brought a new village, a new face, a new story; each sunrise, a renewed sense of wonder at the vastness of the world still stretching before us.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the silence between stars.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions light years from Earth.  The journey was less about the physical exertion and more a test of endurance against the confines of metal and recycled air.  We spent weeks navigating asteroid fields, the void outside a stark reminder of our vulnerability.  But even amidst the cold, calculated precision of interstellar travel, a potent sense of adventure thrived, fueled by the possibility of discovering a new home amongst the shimmering constellations.
