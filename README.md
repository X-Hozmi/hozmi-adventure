
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plateau.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious grains she hoped to deliver to a famine-stricken village far across the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, and the threat of bandits, wild animals, or the unpredictable wrath of nature itself.  Survival, and the fulfillment of her mission, were the ultimate rewards of this arduous journey.


Thousands of years later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow painting his starship's hull.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Xylos system, a perilous journey across uncharted sectors teeming with alien lifeforms, both benign and hostile.  Faster-than-light travel brought them across galaxies in mere weeks, but the constant vigilance required to avoid pirate fleets and navigate treacherous asteroid fields made each voyage a test of skill, courage, and unwavering resolve.
