
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the only sound the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space was a different kind of challenge – the constant hum of the ship's engines, the silent, watchful presence of the cosmos, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant vigilance against unknown celestial phenomena were a daily reality for Eva and her crew, their courage fuelled by the hope of discovering a new home for humanity among the stars.
