
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits, pushing them further into the unknown.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas, her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril; asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown spacefaring civilizations.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the cosmos, pressed on, driven by the scientific imperative to find new worlds and the insatiable human hunger for discovery. The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a beauty and allure that eclipsed any earthly adventure.
