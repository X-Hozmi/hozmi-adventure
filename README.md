
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of exotic spices and shimmering silks from the East.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across swollen rivers, and into the shadowy forests where whispers of bandits and mythical beasts kept even the bravest knights on edge.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, and each nightfall the gnawing uncertainty of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle of swirling colours and distant galaxies, held both wonder and peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all part of the routine.  The promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her unwavering determination across the infinite expanse.
