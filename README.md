
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun glinting off her worn chainmail.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a swamp whispered to be guarded by malevolent spirits and riddled with brigands.  Her quest – to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague – felt as daunting as the endless expanse of swamp and forest.  Every rustle of leaves, every shadow cast by the ancient trees, held the potential for danger, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic map of the Andromeda Galaxy shimmering around them.  Their jump drive was failing, stranding the *Stardust* light years from their destination, the fabled planet Xylos, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic radiation crackled outside the ship, a constant threat, while the dwindling oxygen supply added a chilling urgency to their plight.  Survival itself was an adventure, a fight against the unforgiving vastness of space.
