
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or treacherous terrain.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart, fueled by sibling love, spurred her onward into the unknown, a solitary figure against the vast, breathtaking, and perilous beauty of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rourke piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his destination a distant galaxy holding the fabled Kryll crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Zydonian Empire,  each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.  The vastness of space, filled with wonder and danger in equal measure, was his playground, a thrilling arena of exploration and risk unlike anything known in the dusty tales of old Earth.
