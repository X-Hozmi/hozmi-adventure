
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, to retrieve the lost relic of Saint Jude, has led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest, where whispers of brigands and malevolent spirits chilled him more than the biting wind. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unfamiliar trails, bartering for meager supplies in hostile villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for any sign of pursuit or ambush.  Survival, let alone success, felt like a daily miracle.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing warp drive malfunctions was commonplace.  The vast distances and alien landscapes held far more danger than any medieval forest, but the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, and the camaraderie of her crew fueled her onward. The universe, boundless and breathtakingly beautiful, was their playground, yet each jump into hyperspace was a gamble against the unknown.
