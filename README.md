The sun beat down on the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, the air thick with the scent of pine and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Her worn map, a patchwork of hastily scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the rumored lost monastery said to hold the key to her family's salvation.

The vastness of space, a stark contrast to the limited horizons of medieval travel, presented its own unique challenges and thrills; the unknown beckoned, promising either glorious discovery or catastrophic failure.
