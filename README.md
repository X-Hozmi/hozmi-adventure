
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh elements themselves.  The journey was arduous, testing her resolve at every turn, but the hope for her brother's life fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula's swirling colours, the colossal starships of the Galactic Federation a mere pinprick against the canvas of space. His mission: a perilous exploration of the Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, Jax piloted his vessel, a lone explorer braving the vast unknown. The risks were unimaginable – alien encounters, rogue celestial bodies, the crushing weight of isolation – yet the potential reward of unlocking interstellar travel propelled him forward, a pioneer charting the course for humanity's future among the stars.
