
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I pressed onward, the biting wind a constant companion on my journey across the unforgiving steppes.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista of rolling hills and towering mountains, punctuated by the occasional ramshackle village offering meager respite and often dubious hospitality.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were my unwelcome shadow, but the lure of the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis in the vast desert, pushed me relentlessly onward.  My pack, burdened with supplies and hope, was as much a part of me as my own limbs.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we leap across the Andromeda galaxy, a swirling nebula painting breathtaking colours across my viewport.  Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk across the treacherous cosmic currents, but the reward is the exploration of planets teeming with untold wonders and bizarre, beautiful lifeforms.  The dangers are different now – volatile atmospheres, hostile alien species, the ever-present threat of engine failure – but the thrill of discovery, the yearning to chart the uncharted, remains the same timeless human impulse.
