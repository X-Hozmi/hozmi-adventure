
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague devastating his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and exposure.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria, a beacon of hope in a dying world, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a remote colony on the edge of known space.  Unlike Gareth's journey, hers was punctuated by the hum of advanced technology rather than the creak of saddle leather.  Yet, the sense of adventure was just as potent.  The vast emptiness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel, and the potential encounters with unknown alien lifeforms presented a different, but equally thrilling, challenge to the brave captain and her crew.
