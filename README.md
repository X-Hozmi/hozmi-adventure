
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whisper of Ys, and the desperate hope it offered, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the 'Stardust Wanderer' a tiny speck against the vast expanse of the cosmos. His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the Xylos Cluster, a region teeming with unmapped planets and the potential for untold riches (or annihilation).  The hum of the ship's engines was a constant companion, as was the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown, but the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery in the face of unimaginable scale, fuelled his relentless journey.
