
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rides, the relentless sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bleed into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, and navigating treacherous mountain passes. Each sunrise brings new dangers, but also the thrill of the unknown, the allure of a journey that might save his people, or claim his life. The path is fraught with peril, but the hope of Eldoria’s salvation fuels his weary bones.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but light-years.  Warp jumps carry her through swirling nebulas and past dying stars, each jump a gamble against unknown space anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of her own insignificance against the backdrop of the cosmos, yet fueling her determination to complete her mission and find the lost colonists.
