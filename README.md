
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a priceless map promising a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the secret to curing the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels the fear and the fierce determination driving her onward, a lone figure against the unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation are but minor obstacles in her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel are commonplace dangers, but the lure of uncovering Aethel’s fate, the hope of finding survivors, propels her through the inky void.  The vastness of space offers both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation in equal measure, a challenge only the bravest explorers dare to face.
