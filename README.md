
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, dust clinging to our roughspun tunics, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Each creak of our wagon wheels, each whinny from our exhausted horses, marked another mile closer to the rumored lost city of Ys.  We'd faced bandits, torrential downpours, and weeks of meager rations, but the whispers of untold riches and ancient magic kept our flickering hope alive, urging us ever forward into the deepening twilight. The road ahead remained shrouded in mystery, a tapestry woven with danger and the promise of discovery.

Conversely, centuries ahead, the stars themselves were our highway. The sleek, silver hull of the *Starseeker* cut through the inky blackness, the vibrant nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy a breathtaking spectacle from our viewport.  Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system and its rumored source of near-limitless energy.  We’d traversed wormholes that bent space and time, evaded asteroid fields that shimmered with deadly beauty, and faced the constant threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the vastness of the cosmos, the sheer scale of our journey, instilled in us not fear, but a profound sense of awe and the unyielding determination to reach our destination, no matter the cost.
