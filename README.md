
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking footstep was a gamble against crumbling rock and lurking bandits, the endless expanse of the sun-baked landscape a constant test of endurance and will.  The whispers of mythical creatures and haunted forests only fueled her determination, a fire in her belly burning brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of a dying star painting streaks across the viewport of his starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal hinting at their survival flickering weakly across the vast gulf of space.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, the risk of spatial anomalies a constant threat, but the hope of finding his ancestors, lost generations ago, propelled him onward.  The galaxy stretched before him, a tapestry woven with wonders and dangers equally vast.
