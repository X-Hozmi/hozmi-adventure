
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in fiery hues.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog from a distant village, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for peril – bandits, disease, or simply the unforgiving elements.  Yet, the whispered legends of the monastery, and the desperate hope in her heart, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter', a nebula of swirling purple and gold a breathtaking backdrop to their journey.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, comforting presence, a stark contrast to the raw, unpredictable dangers of medieval travel. Yet, the vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows between stars.  The stakes were higher, the journey longer, but the promise of discovery burned as bright as any medieval legend.
