
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a forced marriage.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse, the relentless pursuit of her unwanted betrothed.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of freedom spurred her onward, across rivers, through forests, and over treacherous mountain passes.  Her destination was a whispered legend – a hidden monastery offering sanctuary.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The journey was fraught with peril, not from bandits or wild beasts, but from unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  The galaxy was a vast and unforgiving expanse, but Jax, driven by scientific curiosity and the promise of a groundbreaking discovery, pushed onward, his trusty AI co-pilot his only companion in the infinite darkness between the stars.
