
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate gamble against the encroaching famine.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or the unknown wonders and terrors of lands beyond her village.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of Samarkand, a shimmer on the horizon, kept her pushing forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered on the bridge, displaying the perilous asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies they must navigate.  The vastness of space held a thrilling allure, but the mission was treacherous; malfunctioning engines, rogue space debris, and the ever-present threat of uncharted cosmic phenomena were constant reminders of the dangers of interstellar travel.  Yet, the pursuit of life beyond Earth fueled her resolve.
