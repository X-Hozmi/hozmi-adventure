
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns – tales of silks and spices in far-off Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each ford across a rushing stream, was a step further into the unknown, a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  His quest, to find a rumored lost city, felt as vast and daunting as the sprawling landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby, a comforting counterpoint to the breathtaking panorama of swirling gas and distant, uncharted stars. Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a colony struggling on the edge of known space.  The dangers were different now –  solar flares, pirate raiders in sleek, black ships, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet the thrill of exploration, of pushing humanity’s boundaries, burned just as brightly within her as it had in Thomas’s heart, a timeless echo across the ages.
