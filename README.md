
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a King's writ, a promise of gold and pardon for a crime he barely remembered committing, tucked inside his oilskin pouch.  His journey to the distant city of Prague was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the whispers of plague stalked him like a wraith.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a prayer for survival.

A thousand years hence, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula of iridescent dust. Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, whispered to contain a planet teeming with a life-sustaining mineral.  The journey across the Milky Way was arduous, demanding precise navigation through asteroid fields and the constant vigilance against space pirates.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of fear than Thomas’s – a lonely, echoing silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling static of distant stars.
