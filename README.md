
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a testament to countless revisions, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unknown stretches of uncharted territory ahead.  The allure of the rumored lost city of Zerzura, whispered in hushed tones in taverns across the land, propelled her onward, despite the ever-present threat of peril.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, yet the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive was a familiar comfort in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  His mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, said to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The charts were ancient, their coordinates unreliable, the dangers – radiation storms, pirate fleets, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar space – undeniable. Yet, the potential reward dwarfed the risk, driving Jax ever closer to the edge of known reality.
