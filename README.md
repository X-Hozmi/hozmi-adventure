
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging their homeland.  Days blurred into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun beating down upon them, and the ever-present fear of ambush in the shadow of looming, unforgiving mountains.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of the journey, but the hope of salvation spurred them on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond known charted space, a potential refuge for a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps tested her skills and the resilience of her crew.  The vast, inky blackness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation, a constant reminder of the monumental task before them and the precariousness of their journey across the cosmic ocean.
