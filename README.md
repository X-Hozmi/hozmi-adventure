
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the salty tang of the sea clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps, a passage fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our meager supplies – dried meats, hardtack, and a few precious flasks of wine – were all that stood between us and the unforgiving wilderness.  Our destination: the fabled city of Constantinople, a shimmering jewel promised by whispered legends and tattered maps, a place of untold riches and exotic wonders.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, our starship, hummed a low, steady thrum as it pierced the void between galaxies.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  We carried with us not just supplies, but hopes and dreams of discovery –  new worlds to chart, alien species to encounter, and the ever-present thrill of the unmapped cosmos. The endless blackness, punctuated by distant nebulae and the glittering tapestry of constellations, held the allure and danger of any great adventure.
