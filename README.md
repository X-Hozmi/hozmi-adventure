
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, pushing him to brave the harsh realities of medieval travel.  He was a solitary figure against a vast and indifferent world, his journey a testament to human resilience and the power of a single man's unwavering purpose.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking cosmic display.  Unlike Sir Kaelan's arduous land journey, her voyage spanned lightyears, traversing the vast distances between planets and even galaxies.  While dangers differed – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life – the underlying spirit remained the same: a relentless pursuit of the unknown, driven by the insatiable human thirst for exploration and discovery. The cosmos was her battlefield, and the stars, her guide.
