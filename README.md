
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped waterskin and a map, its edges frayed from countless journeys.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague followed her like a phantom.  But the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the secrets of forgotten alchemy, pushed her onward, each creak of her mule's saddle a rhythmic beat against the vast, uncertain landscape.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula of Xylos, its engines humming a song only she could hear.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient crystalline life.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the grasp of the Kryll pirates, a ruthless interstellar cartel, was a daily affair.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking wonders, but every jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering the unknown, the uncharted, and the utterly terrifying.  The galaxy was her playground, and its dangers, her challenge.
