
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her cloak pulled tight against the chill, urged her weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered to hold ancient magic and untold riches.  Her journey had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of the distant sun reflecting off a snow-capped peak fueled her onward, a promise of adventure and a chance to escape the poverty of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through swirling cosmic dust.  The mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Wormholes, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present danger of pirate raiders made interstellar travel a constant gamble.  But the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of Aethel's disappearance, propelled Ryla forward across the vast emptiness of space, a journey far more perilous, yet no less thrilling, than any medieval quest.
