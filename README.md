
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried across a continent fractured by war and famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, spoke of unseen dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising a path to salvation, spurred her onward. This was no mere journey; it was a pilgrimage fueled by courage and unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Serpent's Kiss*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal xenofauna.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the challenges remained – hostile alien patrols, treacherous asteroid fields, and the constant threat of engine failure in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential reward – the survival of a dying colony – justified the risk.
