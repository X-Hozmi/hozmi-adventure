
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes, our path fraught with the ever-present threat of bandits and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – fording raging rivers, bartering with suspicious villagers, and dodging the ever-present shadow of the plague that stalks the land.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of untold riches and exotic spices, fuels our onward journey.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship crisscrossing the Andromeda galaxy, carries its human cargo towards a new home amongst the nebulae.  We navigate asteroid fields, grapple with the unpredictable forces of wormholes, and brave the unknown dangers lurking in unexplored star systems.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic abyss, yet the hope of finding a habitable world, a new Eden amidst the infinite expanse of space, propels us forward. The vastness of the cosmos is a breathtaking but terrifying prospect.
