
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the tattered map, its ink bleeding from the relentless rain, charting a perilous route to the mythical city of Zerzura.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles facing him, but the whispers of untold riches and forgotten magic spurred him on.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a test of his endurance and resolve in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable spacetime anomalies that could rip a ship apart.  But Elara, hardened by years of interstellar travel, relied on her instincts and the advanced technology of her vessel, pushing the boundaries of human exploration across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
