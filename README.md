
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril. Bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested her resilience.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the sacred city spurred her on, a beacon in the vast, unknown expanse of medieval Europe.  The whispers of legends and the promise of spiritual enlightenment fueled her steps, making even the hardest days bearable.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  His mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding new worlds and new life, pushed him onward.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
