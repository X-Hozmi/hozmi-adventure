
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the secrets of ancient healing.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of the monastery, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the nebula's iridescent glow.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of subspace storms.  While the comfort of her advanced technology differed drastically from Elara's arduous journey, the same intrepid spirit burned within her.  The vastness of space, though different in scale, offered the same intoxicating blend of danger and discovery that had driven explorers for millennia.
