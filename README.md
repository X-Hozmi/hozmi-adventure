
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the skeletal peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled her onward, a tiny ember against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  The vastness of space, speckled with glittering constellations and shrouded in the eerie silence of the void, held a different kind of danger.  Asteroid fields threatened to pulverize her ship, and the alien landscapes of uncharted planets held untold mysteries, both beautiful and terrifying.  Yet, the pull of the unknown, the lure of discovery, propelled her forward, a solitary explorer charting humanity's future among the stars.
