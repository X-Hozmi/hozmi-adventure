
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onwards, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the whisper of ancient legends and the promise of spiritual renewal a potent elixir against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her ship's controls.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of traversing unimaginable distances, battling cosmic storms, and navigating the treacherous gravitational pulls of black holes.  The thrill of discovery, the unknown challenges of uncharted space, fuelled her ambition, making the loneliness of interstellar travel a small price to pay for the grand adventure unfolding before her.
