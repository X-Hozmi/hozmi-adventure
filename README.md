
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He'd traded his meager inheritance for a mule laden with spices and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered of potential danger – bandits, disease, the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the vast and unpredictable landscape, kept him pressing on, a lone figure against the backdrop of a medieval world brimming with both peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense power and inherent risks of interstellar voyage.  Beyond the viewport, galaxies spun in a dizzying ballet of light and color, a breathtaking spectacle that belied the constant vigilance required to navigate treacherous asteroid fields and avoid the attention of less-than-friendly alien races. The future, like the medieval past, demanded courage, resilience, and a thirst for the unknown.
