
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant shimmer in the hazy afternoon.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just meager rations; it contains the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message across the war-torn French countryside.  Bandits, feuding lords, and the ever-present threat of disease lurk around every bend in the treacherous path ahead, testing her courage and resilience with each passing league.  This journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, is a far cry from the quiet life she once knew.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst colossal gas giants. His mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the dangers are no less real – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, tests his skills and fortitude as he pushes the boundaries of human exploration, seeking a new dawn for mankind amidst the infinite darkness of space.
