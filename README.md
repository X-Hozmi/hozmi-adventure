
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the treacherous mountain passes tested both man and beast.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unfamiliar terrain, scavenging for meager sustenance, and always, the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and monasteries, spurred them on, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a cosmic anomaly decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable spatial distortions was a daily reality.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, faced not only the harsh realities of interstellar travel but also the internal pressures of a desperate search for survivors against the backdrop of a vast, unforgiving cosmos.  The discovery, or the failure to find, would determine the fate of generations.
