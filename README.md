
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn tunic.  Her small band of companions, a grizzled knight, a wizened herbalist, and a surprisingly nimble thief, pressed on, their eyes fixed on the distant, shimmering mirage that might, just might, be the Oasis of Whispering Sands.  Ahead lay dangers untold: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city, and the promise of untold riches, spurred them onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated the swirling nebula, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic dust and incandescent gas. Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey was perilous, fraught with asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien species. But the potential reward – the ability to traverse the cosmos with ease – made the inherent danger a mere footnote in the grand adventure.
