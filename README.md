
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – seeds for a new life, a new beginning far from the plague-ridden village she fled.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat, a reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that roam these lands.  Her journey is perilous, but the hope of a future beyond the horizon fuels her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport are a breathtaking, if slightly terrifying, spectacle. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers are different now – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – but the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, burns just as brightly in Ryla’s heart as it did in Elara's.
