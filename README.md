
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – seeds of hope for a ravaged village far to the east.  Bandits, blizzards, and starvation stalked her every step, but the promise of life fueled her onward, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a hard-won victory.  The vast, unforgiving landscape tested her resilience, transforming her from a simple farmer's daughter into a hardened traveler, her spirit as rugged as the terrain itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula's iridescent veil.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Xylos galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling unpredictable wormholes were mere inconveniences compared to the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of cosmic wonders – nebulas painted across the black canvas, rings of ice swirling around distant gas giants – filled Ryla with a sense of awe, reminding her of the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the known universe, a far cry from the known confines of Earth.
