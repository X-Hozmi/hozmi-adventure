
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sprawl of Carcassonne a distant, shimmering mirage in the afternoon sun.  Her worn leather satchel held not just supplies, but a king's ransom in promises: a lost heir to reunite with his family, a stolen relic to be recovered, and a treacherous mountain pass to be crossed. Each step was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature, yet the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a knight errant in a world teeming with both peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, navigating the treacherous asteroid field.  The shimmering nebula of Xylos painted the viewport in breathtaking colours, a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required to pilot the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling space rocks. His mission: to deliver vital resources to a distant colony teetering on the brink of collapse. The vastness of space, the constant threat of cosmic radiation and pirate attacks, and the unknown dangers of uncharted systems were all part of the price of galactic trade.  But the rewards – and the sheer awe-inspiring wonder of it all – made it worthwhile.
