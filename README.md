
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a rumored lost city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from Constantinople to Damascus.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting a course across unmapped lands and discovering secrets buried for centuries. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, new landscapes, and the possibility of unearthing history itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold a key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies were all in a day's work for a galaxy-hopping adventurer like Rexx.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of challenge – one of cosmic proportions – but the allure of discovery, the sheer exhilaration of pushing the boundaries of known space, burned just as brightly as the distant suns that painted the blackness with vibrant hues.
