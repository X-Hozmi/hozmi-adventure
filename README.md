
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the known world, each sunrise bringing fresh challenges and testing the limits of her courage and resilience.  The whispers of the city spurred her onward, a beacon in a vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas. His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the interstellar distances remained immense, punctuated by the eerie silence of deep space and the occasional perilous encounter with rogue asteroids or unpredictable wormholes.  The hope of reuniting with his people fueled his journey, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the vast, unknowable expanse of the universe.
