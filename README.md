
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged highlands as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through treacherous passes, promising both peril and untold riches.  Ahead lay the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets older than time itself –  a city only reached by braving bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or a swift and brutal end.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her sleek starship.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a gamble, a one-way ticket to a potentially hostile alien world rumored to possess the coveted Xylos Crystals.   Faster-than-light travel brought its own challenges –  navigation through unstable wormholes, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar space. Yet, the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, burned brighter than any star.
