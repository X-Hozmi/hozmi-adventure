
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted with a vital message for the King.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rumors of a plague sweeping the north added a chilling urgency to her journey. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, was a potential threat, a test of her courage and resilience on this perilous pilgrimage across a continent teeming with both beauty and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate incursions across the galactic expanse was commonplace; the vastness of space held its own set of terrifying unknowns.  But Ryla, fueled by the promise of new life and discovery, pressed onward, a lone explorer charting a course through the cosmic ocean, her ship a tiny vessel against the immensity of the universe.
