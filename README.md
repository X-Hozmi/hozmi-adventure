
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their battered packhorses strained under the weight of supplies, their journey a desperate race against the encroaching winter and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the whispered rumours of a fearsome beast guarding a legendary lost city.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to a sacred shrine, tested their courage, their loyalty, and their very endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and flickering from a dying world.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the comforting hum of the ship's engines and the occasional burst of starlight, held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Warp drives, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders created a challenge vastly different from that faced by medieval travelers, but the spirit of adventure, the burning need to explore the unknown, remained the same.
