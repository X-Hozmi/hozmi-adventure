
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel, containing a single, precious map, felt heavy against her side.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of the Black Death clung to the air like a shroud.  Her quest to reach the mythical city of Ys, a legend spoken of in hushed tones, was a treacherous gamble, but the whispered promise of ancient knowledge and untold riches spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the silent tension in the cockpit; the vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held countless unknowns.  Pirate incursions, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were just some of the perils she faced in her relentless pursuit of a new home for humanity.
