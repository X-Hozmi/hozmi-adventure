
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his weary limbs and hardened his resolve. The vast, unpredictable landscape stretched before him, a tapestry woven with both peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the inky blackness between galaxies. Her mission: to chart the unmapped Andromeda system, seeking habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  The vast distances were punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the chilling emptiness of interstellar space.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for disaster – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to shape humanity's future, burned brighter than any fear. The cosmos, a breathtaking ocean of stars, awaited exploration.
