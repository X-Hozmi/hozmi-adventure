
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested her endurance daily, and the whispers of plague in nearby villages fueled her anxieties. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose pushed her forward, the promise of spiritual solace and the thrill of the unknown outweighing the inherent dangers of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora. The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held a constant hum of danger.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters made every jump through hyperspace a gamble.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach beyond the familiar stars, propelled her and her crew across the unimaginable distances, conquering the cosmos one light-year at a time.
