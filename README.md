
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World, a jagged mountain range separating her homeland from the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each pass offered new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed ravines, sudden storms that threatened to sweep her from the narrow paths, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the whispers of Zerzura's untold riches, its shimmering oasis amidst unforgiving desert, fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any star in the inky night sky.  She carried with her not just meager supplies, but the hopes of her entire village.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way was fraught with dangers far exceeding any mountain pass – gravitational anomalies that threatened to crush her ship, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on intergalactic trade routes.  Yet, the promise of discovering a new, habitable world, a planet teeming with resources and untold mysteries, spurred her onward, a beacon brighter than any sun.  The fate of her crew, and potentially billions, rested on her shoulders.
