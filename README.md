
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a whispered rumour of bandits in the next valley, the promise of rich silks in Damascus, the ever-present threat of disease and famine.  We navigate by the stars and the sun, our route dictated by ancient trade paths and the ever-shifting sands of political power.  Every night brings the crackling fire, the shared stories, and the uneasy sleep born of constant vigilance. This is adventure, raw and unforgiving, a dance between hope and fear across a vast and unpredictable land.


Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faces challenges far beyond those of the medieval traveler; navigating treacherous asteroid fields, repairing warp core breaches under the crushing pressure of deep space, and facing the unknown alien life forms that may lurk in uncharted nebulae.  The vast emptiness of space, while breathtaking, is also terrifyingly isolating, a reminder of humanity's fragile existence against the backdrop of an infinite, unforgiving cosmos.
