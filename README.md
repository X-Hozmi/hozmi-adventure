
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary from the encroaching plague.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each mile, Elara’s resolve hardened, fueled by a fierce determination to reach the rumored haven across the border. The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting kindness, a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rourke piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Cosmic anomalies threatened to tear the ship apart, and the weight of his crew's lives rested heavily on his shoulders.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to forge a new life amidst the stars, pushed him onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
