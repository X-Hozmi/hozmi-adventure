
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Kaelan's saddle as he guides his destrier across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the hope of salvation fuels his journey, pushing him ever onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light years.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering strange alien lifeforms, and battling the ever-present threat of malfunctioning warp drives are all in a day's work for Elara and her crew. The vastness of space holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, but the promise of rediscovering lost kin propels them across the cosmic sea.
