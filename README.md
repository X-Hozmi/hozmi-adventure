
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of the wind through the tall grass, whispered of potential dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown spurred him on, a relentless pull stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with the peril of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the colossal distances and unimaginable wonders awaiting her.  With a crew of seasoned explorers at her side, she faced the vast expanse of space, not with fear, but with a boundless curiosity, driven by the same adventurous spirit that had propelled knights across medieval battlefields.
