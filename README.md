
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wooden bridge, each whispering forest, held both the promise of healing and the threat of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching plague.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding colonies.  The vastness of space held both wonder and danger – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations.  The risks were immense, but the potential rewards, a new home for humankind, made the perilous journey worthwhile.
