
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked frame, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was brutal; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with torrential rains, and the relentless sun beat down with merciless intensity.  Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset the gnawing fear that Zerzura was nothing more than a myth.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, a sleek starship cutting through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was child's play compared to the political intrigue and potential betrayal she faced within her own crew.  The vastness of space, once a source of wonder, now felt like a suffocating cage, each jump to hyperspace a gamble with the fate of billions.
