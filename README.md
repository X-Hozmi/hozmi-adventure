
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the ancient map, its parchment brittle with age, depicting the fabled city of Zerzura, said to hold untold riches and secrets.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the gnawing hunger of the open road, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought the daunting beauty of a new landscape, yet also the grim reality of their perilous journey – a test of endurance and will as much as navigation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Alcubierre drive a constant thrum against the ship's hull.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a gamble against the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of wormhole transit.  Ahead lay unknown planetary systems, potential allies or deadly enemies, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding survivors, fueled her determination to push the boundaries of human exploration, a quest as bold and challenging as any medieval pilgrimage.
