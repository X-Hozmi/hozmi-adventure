
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered of in hushed tones amongst her people, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, the biting winds threatened frostbite, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her stomach.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, a city said to hold ancient knowledge and untold riches, spurred her onwards, each arduous mile a testament to her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant reminder of the vast distances separating her from her destination, Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harbouring life.  Though the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration, the yearning to discover the unknown, burned just as brightly in her heart as it had in Elara's.  The cosmos, like the medieval world, held both wonder and terrifying unknowns.
