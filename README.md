
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, a cacophony of sailors' shouts and the stench of fish mingling with the exotic spices arriving from the East.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of laden mules and weary travelers, wound its way across the sun-baked Provençal countryside, then into the shadow of the Alps.  Each day brought its own trials: bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. But with each sunrise came the promise of new vistas, new cultures, and the allure of the unknown, pushing us further towards the legendary city of Constantinople.


Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was equally fraught with peril.  Solar flares threatened to fry our navigational systems, asteroid fields presented a constant threat of collision, and the vast emptiness itself instilled a sense of profound isolation. Yet, the thought of discovering a new world, of walking on alien soil, fuelled our determination and made the risks worthwhile.
