
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Elara's small band of travelers pressed onward.  Their worn map, a testament to countless creases and stains, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains – a fabled city of gold rumored to lie hidden within its shadowed peaks.  Each creak of their pack animals, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both excitement and a primal fear of the unknown.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the harsh wilderness itself were their constant companions on this perilous journey across the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla adjusted her helmet, the swirling nebula outside a breathtaking sight.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a path through the void between galaxies, its destination the unexplored Kepler-186f system.  The mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding colonies.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the potential for hostile alien life – the thrill of exploration remained the same. The vastness of space, however, dwarfed even the wildest medieval dreams of adventure.
