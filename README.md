
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his weary body and spurred him onward through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional means.  Warp drives hummed, defying the vast emptiness of space as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, yet the potential discovery – a new civilization, a forgotten technology – propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
