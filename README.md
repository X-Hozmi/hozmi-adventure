The journey from Constantinople to the fabled city of Alexandria was fraught with peril; pirates lurked in the shadows, and storms could rise with the fury of a vengeful god.  Yet, for young Thomas, the journey was an adventure worth risking his life for.  He dreamed of the wonders of the East, of silks and spices, of bustling bazaars and pyramids that touched the sky.
