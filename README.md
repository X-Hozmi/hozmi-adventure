
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked track as Elara’s horse stumbled, its hooves sinking deep in the mire.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits were a constant threat, the relentless sun a cruel companion, and the ever-present fear of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the whispers of Zerzura’s untold riches and the promise of adventure fueled her onward, each weary step a testament to her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents between galaxies was a test of skill and nerve, but the potential rewards – a rare element found only on the planet Kepler-186f – outweighed the risks.  The crew, a motley band of explorers bound by ambition and a shared thirst for the unknown, braced themselves for the perilous landing, their eyes fixed on the distant, jewel-toned planet that held their future in its grasp.
