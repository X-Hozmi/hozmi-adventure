
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the sun-baked plains, the relentless sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, a city of untold riches and healing, spurred him onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate vessels was commonplace, but the real challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  A miscalculation could mean drifting for decades in the void, or worse – encountering the enigmatic entities that lurked in the deeper reaches of the galaxy.  Yet, the promise of new life and discovery fueled her courage, driving her ever further into the uncharted cosmos.
