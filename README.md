
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests whispered of ambushes, and rumors of the Black Death stalked the land like a phantom.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog sent a jolt of apprehension through him, yet the unwavering faith in his heart spurred him across the bleak landscape, a testament to human resilience in a time of hardship and uncertainty.  He yearned for the cathedral's sanctuary, a promise of peace after weeks spent battling the elements and his own fears.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic dust and swirling gas, both awed and humbled her.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Alien anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made this interstellar voyage far more perilous than any terrestrial expedition. But the hope of finding survivors, of forging a new link with humanity's past, fueled her determination to navigate the treacherous expanse of the galaxy.
