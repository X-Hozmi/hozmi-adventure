
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the Pope, a journey fraught with peril, where each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His only companions were his battered sword, his unwavering faith, and the gnawing hunger in his belly.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. This wasn't a quest for a relic, but for a new beginning, a chance to escape the dying embers of a resource-depleted homeworld.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the lurking threat of pirate syndicates presented a different kind of peril; one measured not in miles, but in parsecs, and where the price of failure was not death alone, but the extinction of humanity's hope.
