
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary mare across the unforgiving plains of Francia.  Ahead, the rumored lost city of Ys beckons, a siren song weaving through tales of ancient magic and untold riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrubland, holds the promise of discovery – or peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine are constant companions on this perilous journey, testing Elara's resilience and pushing her to the very limits of her endurance.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat considered impossible by many.  The vast emptiness of space holds a different kind of danger than the medieval plains; alien encounters, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the constant threat of system failure loom large. Yet, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries, the allure of unexplored worlds, fuels Jax's courage and pushes her ever onward into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
