
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue crested the pass, the stark peaks of the Pyrenees looming before them.  Their journey from Aquitaine to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the constant gnawing hunger in their bellies.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to navigating treacherous mountain trails; yet, the lure of Jerusalem, the whispered promises of faith and glory, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the roadmap for Captain Eva Rostova.  Her sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of space.  Unlike the perilous, uncertain travel of her medieval counterparts, Eva's journey was one of calculated risk and advanced technology. Yet, the thrill remained: the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the endless possibilities that lay hidden among the uncharted constellations fueled her adventure across the cosmos.
