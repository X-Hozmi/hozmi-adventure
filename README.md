
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-dusted plains as Elara’s small caravan trudged onward.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers threatened to sweep them away, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any man.  Each sunrise brought a new test of endurance, a fresh gamble against the unforgiving elements and the unpredictable nature of the land itself.  Yet, with every mile, the thrill of discovery fueled her onward, a potent elixir against despair.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to possess a technology capable of warping spacetime itself.  Warp jumps were risky, each a leap of faith into the unknown, with the possibility of encountering unpredictable gravitational anomalies or hostile alien lifeforms.  But the lure of the unknown, the potential to unravel a galaxy-spanning mystery, outweighed the risks for Rexx and his crew, driving them ever further into the heart of the unexplored expanse.
