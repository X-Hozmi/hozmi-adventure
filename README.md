
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he crests the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before him. His quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fuels his journey, pushing him onward towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant hum of the warp drive are the daily realities of her life.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, is a constant reminder of the monumental scale of her endeavor, and the potential rewards – and losses – that lie ahead.
