
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant King for aid against the encroaching famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each screech of a hawk overhead, was a pulse of anxiety in the heart of this solitary journey across a land rife with bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Survival wasn't guaranteed; only her resolve remained unwavering.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', pierced the nebula's iridescent glow.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless unmapped planets.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a hypnotic drone against the vast, star-dusted canvas outside.  Though technology shielded them from the harshest realities of space, the sense of isolation was palpable, a profound loneliness tempered only by the camaraderie of her crew and the thrill of discovery.  The unknown beckoned, promising both wonder and peril in equal measure.
