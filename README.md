His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's debilitating illness.  Robbers, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but minor inconveniences in his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the medieval kingdom.

The uncharted territories of space presented a different kind of wilderness, one filled with cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, but the lure of exploration and discovery fueled her every decision.
