
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and past villages ravaged by the plague.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in the shadows, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of their destination. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred them onwards, a potent mix of faith and sheer adventurous spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with peril;  uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of engine failure tested her crew to their limits. But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, the potential to rewrite the laws of interstellar travel, fueled their daring expedition across the cosmic void.
