
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys, a whispered legend amongst her people, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, the glint of the rumored sapphire river, and the promise of untold riches, fueled her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that could rewrite the known universe.  The stars themselves seemed to whisper warnings – gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the chilling silence of unexplored space – all tested the limits of his ship and his courage.  But the lure of the unknown, the chance to discover something never before seen by human eyes, propelled him further into the cosmic expanse.
