
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Kaelan’s lungs as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or monstrous beast.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and resilience, demanding both physical and mental fortitude, a testament to the unwavering bond between a brother and sister.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  While technology lessened the physical strain, the mental pressure was immense, requiring unwavering focus and rapid decision-making amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.  Her voyage was a leap into the unknown, a testament to human ambition and the relentless pursuit of discovery.
