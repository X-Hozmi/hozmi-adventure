
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the creak of leather and the rhythmic beat of hooves a counterpoint to the howling wind.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes blanketed in snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled his journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp jump.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and alien encounters that threatened her mission.  But the promise of reuniting a lost civilization, and the uncharted territories waiting to be discovered, spurred her onward into the limitless expanse of the cosmos.
