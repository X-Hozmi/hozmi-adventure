
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, spurred their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation pushed them further, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic system failure, alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the loneliness of interstellar travel pressed heavily on the crew.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to unravel a centuries-old mystery, propelled them forward, their adventure a thrilling gamble against the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.
