
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, guided his weary horse across the parched, dust-choked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the legendary Sunstone.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in his dogged pursuit of glory and the promise of untold riches.  Each sunrise brought the chilling realization of how far the journey still stretched before him, yet the lure of the unknown spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to possess advanced technology capable of ending the intergalactic war.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing warp drives were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space presented challenges that dwarfed even the most formidable medieval landscape, but the hope of peace fueled their daring expedition across the cosmic sea.
