
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was far from over.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of hope, fueled by her unwavering love for her brother, kept her determined steps moving westward, the rhythm of her horse's hooves a steady counterpoint to the wind's mournful song.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant test of skill and nerves.  But unlike the medieval traveler, Eva possessed the technological marvels of faster-than-light travel and advanced sensors.  Yet, the sense of isolation, the vastness of space, and the ever-present risk of catastrophic equipment failure instilled a similar bravery and determination, mirroring Elara's journey across a different, equally perilous landscape.
