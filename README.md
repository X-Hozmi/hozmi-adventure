
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the desperate hope in her heart fueled her onward, each step a gamble against the perilous wilderness and the encroaching night.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, cursing the quantum entanglement anomaly that had thrown his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, off course.  Instead of Kepler-186f, they were hurtling through the uncharted void between galaxies, a cold, black expanse where even the faintest starlight was a forgotten luxury.  Their oxygen supply dwindled, their navigation systems fried, but Rexx, a veteran of a hundred interstellar voyages, refused to surrender. Survival meant facing the unknown, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and perhaps, discovering something far more wondrous than their original destination.
