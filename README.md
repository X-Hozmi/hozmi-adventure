
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the trails were treacherous, and the nights were filled with the howling of wolves and the whispers of unseen dangers. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose spurred her on, the allure of the distant cathedral a beacon in the vast, untamed landscape.  She carried with her not only her meager possessions but also the hope of finding solace and redemption.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The breathtaking panorama of swirling nebulae and distant suns was a familiar sight, yet each jump held a unique thrill, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The dangers weren't wolves or bandits, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving expanse of space.  Yet, the potential reward – a future free from conflict – fueled her unwavering determination to navigate the cosmos and reach her destination.
