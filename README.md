
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the legendary lost city of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of healing the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril, a constant reminder of the bandits, wild beasts, and the very elements themselves that threatened his journey.  His survival depended not only on his sword arm, but his resilience and the kindness of strangers along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, demanded unwavering focus and the cutting edge technology of her starship.  Eva, however, was driven not by greed or glory, but by the hope of finding a new home for a dying Earth. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of a new beginning, but the cost of reaching it was immeasurable.
