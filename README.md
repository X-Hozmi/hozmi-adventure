
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery.  Each rocky mile was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature, but the whispered legends of the monastery's healing balm fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'roared' through the crimson nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'The Wanderer'.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Void Serpents was child's play compared to the political machinations back on Earth, but Rexx, a seasoned veteran, knew the greatest dangers weren't always the physical ones. The fate of humanity, it seemed, depended on a successful jump to the far side of the galaxy.
