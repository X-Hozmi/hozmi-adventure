
Sir Reginald, his chainmail glinting under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track snaked through a landscape of brooding forests and treacherous mountains, a far cry from the manicured gardens of his lord’s manor.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, fording icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of lost cities and forgotten magic, spurred him onwards, a knight errant on a quest both perilous and exhilarating.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the inky expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political minefields of intergalactic trade. Each jump through hyperspace brought the promise of new worlds, strange alien civilizations, and untold riches – but also the threat of pirates, warring empires, and the chilling unknown that lay beyond the reach of even the most advanced sensors.  The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, was her playground.
