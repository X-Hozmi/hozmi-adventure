The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – jagged peaks clawed at the sky, while deep ravines threatened to swallow man and beast whole.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing queen.

The vastness of the cosmos held both immense promise and terrifying uncertainty.
