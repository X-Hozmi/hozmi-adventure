
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged peaks as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of salvation fueled their weary steps, pushing them further into the unknown wilderness.  The scent of pine and the distant howl of wolves accompanied their arduous journey, a constant reminder of the raw, untamed beauty and danger of their medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, was a constant companion.  Each jump to hyperspace held a risk, yet the potential reward – a revolution in galactic exploration – made the gamble worthwhile.
