
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next horizon – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey whispered about in hushed tones, a destination promising both riches and ruin.  This was not a mere journey; it was a gamble against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, hard reality of interstellar travel.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising potential for human colonization. The vast distances between star systems meant years spent under the hum of the ship's engines, punctuated by the occasional thrill of navigating asteroid fields or the chilling silence of deep space.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the unknown, even if it meant facing unimaginable cosmic wonders – and horrors – along the way.
