
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the scent of pine and fear thick in the air.  Her journey from the bustling port city of Marseilles to the mythical Silk Road cities of the East was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease clung to the air like a shroud, and the ever-present threat of famine shadowed every sunrise. Yet, with each weary mile, her determination burned brighter, fuelled by whispers of fabled riches and a yearning to escape the stifling confines of her past.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal engine of the 'Stardust Drifter' humming a lullaby of ionized particles.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The journey was a tapestry woven from breathtaking cosmic landscapes and the constant, low thrum of potential catastrophe – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirates who preyed on unsuspecting explorers traversing the uncharted sectors of the galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
