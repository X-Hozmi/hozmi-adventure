
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the ravaged lands of France had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each day brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience.  He carried with him not only a battered sword but the hope of finding his lost brother, a hope that fuelled his weary steps towards the distant shores of England.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at warp speed.   The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns and the occasional asteroid field, was a different kind of hardship – the isolation, the constant threat of equipment failure, the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown. But Eva, like Reginald before her, pressed onward, driven by a purpose that transcended the immense distances that separated her from her destination.
