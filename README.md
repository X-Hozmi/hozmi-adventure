
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the breadth of Europe had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Ys, a city said to hold untold riches and magical artifacts, spurred him onward. The rough-hewn map clutched in his hand, stained with sweat and rain, was his only guide through the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare energy source vital to the survival of her fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigation across the vast interstellar distances was a constant challenge, relying on complex astrogation and the fickle whims of hyperspace jumps.  The risks were immense - encountering hostile alien lifeforms, navigational errors leading to uncharted regions, or even the catastrophic failure of the ship’s hyperdrive.  But the future of her people rested on her success.
