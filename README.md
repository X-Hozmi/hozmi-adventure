
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Aethelred, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and into the shadowy forests where outlaws lurked. Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter. Yet, the hope of reaching Aethelred, of making a difference in the looming conflict, fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigation through asteroid fields, evasive maneuvers against pirate raiders, and the constant threat of engine failure tested her skills and the resilience of her crew. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling brilliance of distant suns, both terrified and awed her, while the promise of discovery and the potential for salvation for the lost colonists drove her onward.
