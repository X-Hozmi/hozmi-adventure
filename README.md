
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's small company crested the hill, the sun beating down on their worn leather and chainmail.  Before them stretched the unforgiving expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-baked fields, gnarled forests whispering with unseen dangers, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient ruins. Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of saving their plague-stricken village.  Every mile was a battle against fatigue, hunger, and the unknown, a constant gamble against the unpredictable elements and the malevolence of man.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's chronometer ticking off parsecs instead of leagues. Their mission: a perilous survey of the newly discovered Xylos system, rumored to contain planets rich in the rare element, Xylium, essential for faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes were everyday hazards. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of terror – the chilling, absolute loneliness of being utterly lost amongst the unimaginable expanse of the cosmos.
