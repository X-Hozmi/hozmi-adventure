
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald’s worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary steed across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of a notorious brigand known only as “The Serpent.”  Each day brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile villages, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Yet, the glint of the setting sun on his ancestral sword spurs him onward, a promise of glory, or perhaps, a grim end, awaiting him at journey's end.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against dwindling oxygen and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Warp drives hum, stars streak across the viewport, and the weightless expanse of space offers both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation.  The fate of countless colonists rests on her shoulders, and the uncharted territories beyond hold the key to their survival – or their annihilation.
