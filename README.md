His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the burning hope in his heart fueled his journey, pushing him ever closer to his elusive goal, a journey across a land both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer*, a sleek starship navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.

Cosmic storms threatened to crush her vessel, while unknown alien encounters loomed as a constant, unpredictable danger.  But the promise of a new home for her people spurred her onward, into the uncharted darkness of the cosmos.
