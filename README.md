
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to Avignon, to plead her brother's case before the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death chilled her more than the autumn wind.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each mile a testament to her courage and the strength of her resolve.  She carried not only her brother's fate but the hopes of her entire village on her weary shoulders.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues of gas giants and distant galaxies painted a breathtaking canvas beyond her viewport, a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of the bridge.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The risks were immense – unknown alien species, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates – but Nova, with her unwavering spirit and seasoned crew, pressed on, driven by the promise of a future bathed in the light of countless suns.
