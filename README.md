
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the dense forests, and the harsh terrain tested both man and beast.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the distant horizon, fueled his unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, believed to have vanished into the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading hostile space pirates was a daily occurrence.  The vastness of space, a cold, unforgiving expanse, offered breathtaking vistas but also presented perils far beyond anything Thomas could have imagined. Yet, the hope of finding Aethel and uncovering the mysteries of their disappearance pushed Elara and her crew further into the cosmic unknown.
