
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in impoverished villages, testing their courage and resilience with every mile.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the planet Xylos, a world whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was less about physical hardship and more about navigating treacherous nebulae, dodging asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone vessels traversing the interstellar void. Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, demanding the highest level of skill and unwavering resolve.
