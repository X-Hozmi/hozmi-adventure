
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury to seek a cure for the squire’s ailing mother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the muddy roads threatened to swallow their weary mounts, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce supplies in remote villages, and enduring the relentless stares of those who viewed them with suspicion.  Yet, the unwavering hope for healing fueled their arduous trek across the land.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravity wells of unseen celestial bodies, and battling the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  The vast distances, the alien landscapes of uncharted planets, and the loneliness of deep space tested her limits. But the lure of discovery, the promise of uncovering the mysteries of the cosmos, propelled her onward, across the unfathomable expanse of galaxies.
