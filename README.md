
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey from York to Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating unfamiliar dialects, bartering for meager provisions, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers. The thrill of the unknown, however, far outweighed the hardship;  she chased a legend whispered in taverns – a lost city of gold, hidden somewhere beyond the vast steppes.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylan crystals, a source of limitless energy, scattered across distant galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and enduring the bone-jarring jumps between wormholes were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, the unimaginable beauty of alien worlds, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown life forms fuelled her insatiable thirst for exploration. The galaxy was her oyster, and she was determined to harvest its pearls.
