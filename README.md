
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in fiery hues.  His quest, a perilous journey to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Fiacre, had tested him beyond measure. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation had become commonplace. Yet, the glint of the distant abbey spire, his destination, spurred him onward, a beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of the cosmic dust clouds were breathtaking, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and the constant threat of warp-core malfunctions were all part of the routine.  But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering something extraordinary, fueled her drive across the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
