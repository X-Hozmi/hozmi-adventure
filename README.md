
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina and deliver a sacred relic, was a perilous journey through uncharted territories, rife with treacherous mountain passes, swirling mists concealing lurking dangers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The weight of her responsibility, and the vast, unknown distance ahead, filled her with a mixture of terror and exhilarating defiance.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation systems.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks but in light-years.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the occasional, ominous shadow of an asteroid field, tested the limits of human endurance and technology.  But the promise of discovery, and the hope of finding survivors, fueled her relentless journey across the cosmic sea.
