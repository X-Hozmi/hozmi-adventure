
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his armor caked in dried mud and sweat, urges his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the endless war ravaging the kingdom.  Days bleed into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, forays into dark forests teeming with unknown beasts, and the constant gnawing hunger in his belly.  Each sunrise brings the hope of progress, each sunset the chilling reality of the journey's relentless difficulty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of swirling crimson and gold. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars is commonplace.  The crew faces the constant threat of equipment malfunctions, resource depletion, and the ever-present unknown lurking in the vast, unexplored reaches of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding Xylos and their lost kin, fuels their tireless journey across the cosmos.
