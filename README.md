
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the dusty plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, guides her mule westward.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from Constantinople to Damascus.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and treacherous mountain passes stand between her and her goal; each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resourcefulness. The allure of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Conversely, centuries later, Captain Rexa commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a cluster of potentially habitable planets.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace are all in a day's work for Rexa and her crew.  The boundless expanse of the cosmos offers unparalleled adventure, but the risks are equally vast, and the rewards—the potential for discovery and colonization—are beyond imagining.
