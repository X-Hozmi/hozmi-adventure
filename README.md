
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each whispered prayer, each treacherous mountain pass represented a step closer to salvation, or perhaps, a swift end to her perilous journey.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this medieval odyssey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and coping with the unpredictable gravitational forces of alien systems were all in a day's work for a galactic courier, but the thrill of exploring the uncharted cosmos, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fueled his every daring maneuver.
