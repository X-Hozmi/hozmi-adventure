
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Before her stretches a seemingly endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of wheat fields and dark forests whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, is perilous, fraught with the ever-present dangers of bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Each day brings a new challenge, a new test of her resilience,  but the hope of reaching her destination fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a rare crystalline element from the uncharted planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be teeming with both unimaginable riches and deadly xenofauna.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines of distance, but the journey remains fraught with peril; asteroid fields, hostile space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself constantly threaten to end his voyage.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, holds the key to his success, or his ultimate demise.
