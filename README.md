
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Fiacre, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague stalked them like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new hardship; a crossing of a treacherous river, a desperate search for dwindling supplies, the ever-present fear of betrayal. Yet, the glint of the distant shrine, a beacon of hope against the unforgiving landscape, fuelled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vast emptiness of space was punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling of her comms system. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all part of the journey.  The vast distances and unknown dangers were immense, yet the possibility of finding her people, of reuniting a scattered civilization, made the cosmic voyage worthwhile.
