
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, bandit ambushes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He traveled with a small band of hardy companions, their camaraderie forged in the crucible of shared hardship, their hopes as vast as the unknown lands ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, yet the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, and unknown alien entities lurked in the inky blackness between stars.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, mirrored the boundless courage and unwavering determination of Eva and her crew.
