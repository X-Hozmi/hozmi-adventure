
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of her resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the faint hope of reaching her destination before winter's icy grip tightened its hold.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius steered his starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a delicate dance between celestial charts and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, the constant hum of the engines a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse.  The risks were different—cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, the potential for unknown alien encounters—but the thrill of discovery, the untamed frontier spirit, echoed the adventures of those medieval travelers, chasing their own elusive dreams across the limitless expanse, be it land or cosmos.
