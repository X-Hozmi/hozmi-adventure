
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Samarkand's wonders fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, Ryla and her crew faced dangers beyond imagination – sentient nebulae, hostile alien races, and the constant threat of warp core failure.  But the hope of finding Xylos, and the promise of a new home for her people, spurred them across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
