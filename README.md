
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to escape the encroaching plague.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  But with every sunrise, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by the unwavering belief that somewhere beyond the horizon lay a sanctuary, a new beginning.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the galactic canvas. His mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel masked the true length of their journey, but the isolation and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and unknown space anomalies created a different kind of hardship.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the crew's courage and resilience in a quest for survival across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
