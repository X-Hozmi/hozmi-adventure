
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a swamp whispered to swallow unwary travelers whole.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the reeds, fueled a mixture of terror and fierce determination – a testament to the courage required for medieval overland journeys.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, a far cry from the muddy trails of Elara's time.  But the stakes were just as high; Eva’s mission was to locate a new habitable world for a humanity teetering on the brink of extinction.  The cold, sterile beauty of space held a different kind of peril, but the drive to survive, to find a new home, burned as brightly as any medieval adventurer's hope.
