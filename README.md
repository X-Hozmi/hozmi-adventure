
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a worn map.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses. Bandits were a constant threat, the mountains themselves a labyrinth of treacherous paths.  But the whispered tales of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient healing secrets, fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any star in the inky night sky. The journey was brutal, a test of endurance against both nature and man, yet the promise of discovery spurred her relentlessly.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumoured haven for rare crystalline alloys vital to galactic trade.  Warp jumps were perilous, wormholes unpredictable, and pirate raids commonplace.  But the lure of untold riches and the thrill of charting the unknown were intoxicating, a siren song beckoning him across the vast emptiness between worlds.  The risks were colossal, but the potential reward far outweighed the fear.
