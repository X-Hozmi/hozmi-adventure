He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, depicting the perilous route to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the obstacles standing between him and the rumored riches and knowledge held within its walls.  Each creak of his saddle, each distant howl of a wolf, fueled the fire of his adventure, a desperate gamble against the odds for glory and survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The journey was fraught with peril; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravity wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships prowled the void between stars.  But Eva, a veteran of countless voyages, navigated the cosmos with unwavering determination, her eyes fixed on the distant emerald glow of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope in the endless black.
