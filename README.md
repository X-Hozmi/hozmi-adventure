
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of exotic spices and shimmering silks from the far East.  His quest: to find his estranged brother, rumored to have joined a caravan bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each jostle of the rough terrain, represented another step closer to the unknown, a gamble against bandits, disease, and the sheer unforgiving vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense power and equally immense risks inherent in interstellar travel.  Ahead lay the promise of discovery, of new life and civilizations, but also the ever-present danger of uncharted space, rogue asteroids, and the unknown entities that might lurk in the cosmic dark.
