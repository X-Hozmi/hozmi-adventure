
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his squire barely keeping pace, spurred his destrier across the windswept plains of France.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud and ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease tested their mettle.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of surviving another day in a land both beautiful and brutal.  Their destination lay far, a beacon of hope against the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Wanderer* a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the unexplored planet of Aethel, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile K'tharr warships, and enduring weeks of hyperspace jump fatigue, Elara and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers. The galaxy was their wilderness, its wonders and terrors equally boundless.
