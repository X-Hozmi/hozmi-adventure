
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, a path whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse, was a desperate bid to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing fear that hope itself might crumble before she reached her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant lullaby against the breathtaking cosmic backdrop. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold both untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  The vast expanse of space, while breathtaking, held the constant threat of asteroid fields, pirate raiders, and the unknown horrors lurking within uncharted galaxies.
