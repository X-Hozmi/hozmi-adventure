
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a perilous adventure. Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the forests whispered with unseen dangers, and the rumors of a monstrous beast lurking in the Black Mire fueled their anxieties. Each creak of their saddlebags, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for a thrilling, terrifying encounter – a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of travel in the medieval world.  They relied on their wits, their swords, and the kindness of strangers for survival, their destination a distant promise against the backdrop of a harsh and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent hues. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted planets.  While lacking the immediacy of medieval peril, her voyage held a different kind of danger: the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the threat of rogue asteroids, and the possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations.  Each jump to warp speed was a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of discovery or a graveyard of forgotten explorers.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was her constant companion on this epic, galactic odyssey.
