
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the mythical griffins said to guard the mountain passes.  Her meager supplies dwindled, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril; asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp-core malfunctions tested her skills and courage. But the promise of a new beginning for humanity, a chance to spread life across the galaxy, spurred her to push onward, a lone voyager charting a course through the inky black.
