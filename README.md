
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and the gnawing hunger in his belly.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, dense forests teeming with unknown dangers, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of his dreams, propelled him forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal detected after decades of silence.  Warp drives hummed, the stars a dizzying spectacle outside her viewport.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems became her daily routine.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, tested her limits.  But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fractured civilization, fuelled her unwavering determination to reach her destination.
