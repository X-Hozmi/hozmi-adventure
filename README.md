
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be home to witches and worse.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril – bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation lurked around every bend.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a prayer for survival, as Thomas ventured deeper into the heart of medieval Europe, relying on his wits and the kindness of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained: unpredictable gravitational anomalies, pirate fleets, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, uncharted cosmos.  Yet, for Eva, the thrill of exploration outweighed the fear, driving her relentlessly forward in her quest.
