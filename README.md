
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, felt a lifetime away, each league a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape and its inhabitants. Yet, the whispered tales of its riches, its silks and spices, fuelled our weary spirits and spurred us onward, a testament to the human desire for discovery even amidst hardship.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, our generation starship, leaped across the void between galaxies, each jump a calculated risk, a dance with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  We weren't bound by earthly limitations; our quest was for new worlds, for habitable planets teeming with unknown life. The thrill of discovery, the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and alien suns, far surpassed the dangers of unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile extraterrestrial encounters.  The universe was our oyster, and the boundless expanse beckoned us towards the infinite unknown.
