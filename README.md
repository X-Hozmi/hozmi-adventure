
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Duchy of Aquitaine was far from the tapestry-hung halls of her childhood.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the overgrown forest, held the potential for bandits, disease, or worse – the lingering whispers of the Black Death.  Yet, the quest for the lost grimoire, whispered to hold the secret to healing the land, fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  The swirling nebula outside the viewport painted a breathtaking, if somewhat hazardous, picture.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped Cygnus X-1 region, searching for a rumored habitable planet capable of sustaining the dwindling population of Xylos.  The vastness of space, unlike the limited geography of medieval Europe, held a different kind of peril; the silent emptiness threatening to swallow her whole, or the unpredictable anomalies lurking in the dark between stars.
