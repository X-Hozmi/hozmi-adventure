
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless steppe were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, each sunset the quiet contemplation of a journey that tested both body and soul.  He traveled with a small band of companions, their bonds forged in hardship and shared purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and establish contact with a potentially sentient species.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, each jump a leap of faith across vast interstellar distances.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, radiation storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – but the thrill of exploration, the irresistible pull of the unknown, remained a constant companion. The galaxy stretched before her, a canvas of uncharted wonders and perilous adventures.
