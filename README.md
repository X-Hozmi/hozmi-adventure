
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Eadric, was proving far more arduous than the legends suggested.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road tested their resolve daily.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching their destination, but also the grim reality of another day spent battling the unforgiving landscape and its dangers.  Their medieval adventure was a test of faith, courage, and endurance.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace on her interstellar voyages, but the ethereal beauty of the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and starlight, held a captivating allure even to a hardened spacefarer like Rostova. The galaxy stretched before her, an infinite expanse of adventure, danger, and untold wonders waiting to be discovered.
