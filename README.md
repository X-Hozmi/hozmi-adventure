
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend of unimaginable riches guarded by treacherous mountains and even more treacherous bandits.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.  The journey had already claimed the lives of several companions, yet the lure of Eldoria, and the whispered promise of glory, pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting drone against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, displaying the perilous asteroid fields and unpredictable gravitational currents that lay between her and her goal.  The stakes were high; the future of humanity might rest on the success of this mission, a thrilling burden shouldered by a woman who craved the stars.
