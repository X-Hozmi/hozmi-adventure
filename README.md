
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley collection of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-choked track, the stench of rain-soaked earth and decaying leaves heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought the promise of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to rest in the forgotten city of Eldoria, spurred us onward, a beacon against the encroaching twilight. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of discovery and the chilling possibility of death.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, our generation starship, hummed a low, resonant song as we navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours painting the bridge in ethereal hues.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of new worlds, alien civilizations, and untold riches fueled our relentless pursuit of the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f. The cosmos held wonders beyond imagination, but also dangers as vast and terrible as the galaxy itself.
