Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness, demanded more than courage; it demanded endurance against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming spores to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.

But the promise of life burgeoning on a new world, a future beyond the confines of Earth, outweighed every risk.
