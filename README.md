
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of rosemary and sweat thick in the air.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the weary travelers along the road.  Each sunrise brought the promise of breathtaking vistas and challenging terrain, from snow-capped Pyrenees to sun-drenched vineyards, a constant reminder of both the beauty and brutality of this medieval world.  Her destination felt as distant and mythical as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unmapped galaxies and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of swirling colours and celestial bodies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyper-jumps across light years brought unknown dangers - rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on vulnerable transports. Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting new worlds and potentially finding life beyond Earth, fueled her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the infinite cosmos.
