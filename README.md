
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley collection of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the dust-choked road in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Our quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of unimaginable power, spurred us relentlessly onward, each footstep a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving odds.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, hummed beneath my feet as we hurtled towards Xylos, a planet veiled in swirling nebulae, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels in the void, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of discovery.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble with the fabric of spacetime itself, but the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets made the risks worthwhile.
