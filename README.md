
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death loomed large. Yet, the hope of healing spurred her onward, a beacon against the bleak backdrop of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy was risky, a gamble to reach the rumored Xylossian healing crystals, the only substance capable of repairing her damaged bio-neural implant.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and dealing with fluctuating wormhole stability were all in a day's work for Nova, but the vastness of space, the potential for discovery and catastrophic failure, made every voyage a thrilling, perilous adventure.
