
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate moors, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest, to recover the stolen relic of St. Elara, led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadowy heart of a forgotten kingdom. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies, and outwitting both human and supernatural foes. The journey itself was a trial, testing his courage and resilience as much as his swordsmanship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems mid-jump were all part of a typical voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, demanded unwavering focus and a reliance on technology far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers. Yet, the sense of wonder and the thrill of exploration remained a constant, a shared legacy across the ages.
