
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate race against a shadow.  News of the Black Death’s advance preceded them like a phantom herald, painting every village they passed in the grim hues of fear.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, felt weighted with the uncertainty of survival as they traversed treacherous mountain passes and navigated the ever-present threat of banditry.  Their quest for salvation became a test of endurance, their faith a shield against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the battlefield. Captain Eva Rostova, helming the starship *Odyssey*, navigated the treacherous nebula of Xylos, dodging asteroid fields and dodging the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Hegemony.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal dance with probability, each jump a gamble against unpredictable spatial distortions.  Her crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, fought not for gold or glory, but for survival, their destinies woven into the vast tapestry of the cosmos.  The galaxy held untold wonders, but also unimaginable perils, and their journey to the Kepler-186f system was a desperate gamble for a new home amongst the stars.
