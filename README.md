
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the unforgiving sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a gritty curtain obscuring the already hazy horizon.  Their journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela – was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the challenges that lay ahead.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another league conquered, their faith and determination their only constant companions.

Conversely, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her ship a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Years had bled into months, months into weeks since leaving Earth, the familiar blue marble now a distant memory.  The hyperspace jump had been successful, but the destination – Kepler-186f – still lay light-years away.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers bound by a shared sense of wonder and ambition, faced challenges of a different sort:  navigating treacherous asteroid fields, repairing damaged warp drives, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  The journey to a new world was a gamble, but one they were willing to take.
