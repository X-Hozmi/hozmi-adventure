
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaked across the dusty plains.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, making them seem both impossibly close and infinitely far.  Every night, huddled around crackling fires, we shared stories of legendary cities, fearsome beasts, and the mystical power said to lie hidden in the heart of the unexplored north.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Stardust Wanderer* sliced through the inky blackness, its navigation systems charting a course through uncharted nebulae.  We were pioneers, charting new worlds, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  The alien landscapes that greeted us – vibrant, hostile, breathtakingly beautiful – were far removed from the medieval world’s limitations, but the thrill of discovery, the facing of the unknown, remained a constant in both eras.
