
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully in the afternoon sun, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering pines of the Black Forest, a far cry from the manicured gardens of his lord’s manor.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Eadbald from the clutches of a reclusive hermit rumored to possess dark magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, fueling the excitement of his perilous journey across the unknown landscape.  He carried with him not only his sword, but the hope of his kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising new sources of vital energy for a struggling Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space was as treacherous as any medieval forest.  But the thrill of discovery, the potential to unlock the mysteries of the cosmos, outweighed the constant danger.  With each jump to hyperspace, she felt the exhilaration of pushing boundaries, of charting a course into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
