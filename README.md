
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors that swirled around his destination – a fabled city whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown that pulled him ever closer to his goal, a quest fueled by whispered legends and a desperate hope for fortune.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion to Captain Eva Rostova.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant color as she navigated the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, her destination a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating in the lawless expanse between galaxies.  But the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers, a timeless human drive to push the boundaries of the known world, however vast that world might be.
