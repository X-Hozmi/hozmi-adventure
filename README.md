
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree had sent him on a perilous quest across the breadth of England and into the unknown wilds of Scotland, to retrieve a sacred relic said to hold the power to cure the plague that ravaged the land.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the challenges he faced in his desperate race against time. Each sunrise brought new dangers, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Warp drives hummed, dodging rogue asteroids and navigating treacherous gravitational fields.  Alien lifeforms, both benevolent and hostile, lurked in the inky blackness.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed on, driven by a promise made to the colony's desperate survivors, a testament to humanity's boundless courage in exploring the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
