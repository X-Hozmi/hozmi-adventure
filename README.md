
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising the legendary lost city of Zerzura, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each hawk circling overhead, held a potential threat: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of the plague. Yet, the allure of the unknown spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wanderer*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet within the Andromeda galaxy, a desperate search for humanity's survival amidst a dying Earth.  The jump to hyperspace was a terrifying lurch, followed by the endless, star-strewn expanse of the void.  Ryla faced not just the perils of space – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and malfunctioning systems – but the weight of her crew's hopes, and the daunting uncertainty of finding a new home amongst the infinite stars.
