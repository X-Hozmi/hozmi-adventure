
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a brown cloud trailing the small caravan as they traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to be hidden in the faraway kingdom of Eldoria, fueled their perilous journey, a beacon in the vast, uncertain expanse of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The jump to the Xylos system had been rough, the warp drive shuddering under the strain of traversing the galactic void. Ahead lay Xylos IV, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a discovery that could change the course of interstellar civilization.  But the Xylos system was known for its unpredictable nebulae and pirate factions; the journey, though technologically advanced, was far from safe.  The galaxy held its own dangers, just as treacherous as any medieval wilderness.
