
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against starvation and death.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of glory, propelled him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.  He rode towards the horizon, a tiny figure against the immense backdrop of a medieval world brimming with danger and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant K'tharr Hegemony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable jumpspace anomalies were child's play compared to the political maneuvering and potential sabotage that threatened her mission.  Each warp jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast and unpredictable expanse of interstellar space. The future beckoned, but it demanded courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck from those daring enough to explore it.
