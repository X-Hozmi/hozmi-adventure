
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-covered plains of Russia, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards of my home in Provence. This journey, a pilgrimage to the holy city of Kiev, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the grim possibility of never seeing home again. Yet, with every mile, my resolve hardened, fuelled by faith and the thrilling, terrifying allure of the unknown.

Conversely, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting drone against the inky blackness of the void.  Navigating the Andromeda Galaxy, a shimmering tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, was breathtaking, yet equally perilous.  Asteroid fields were dodged with practiced ease,  and the potential threat of pirate fleets—operating out of the lawless edges of known space—remained a constant worry.  My mission, to deliver a vital bio-engineered seed sample to a colony struggling for survival on Kepler-186f, was as important as it was daunting.  The vastness of space offered a majesty surpassing even the most epic terrestrial journeys; a terrifying and exhilarating symphony of light and darkness.
