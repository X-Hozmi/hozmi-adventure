
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of sickness.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a potent elixir against weariness and fear.  The whispers of ancient legends, the bustling life of medieval towns, and the sheer immensity of the landscape itself were rewards enough.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirates of the Crimson Syndicate was all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, speckled with unimaginable wonders and perilous unknowns, offered a different kind of adventure, one where the stakes were galactic and the rewards potentially world-altering. The journey was not merely about reaching a destination; it was about pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
