
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin chafing against her skin.  The King's decree, a frantic scrawl promising riches beyond imagining, had lured her from her quiet village life. Now, bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions on this perilous journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the grim reality of her isolation in a vast, unforgiving world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant, comforting drone against the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling like cosmic paint strokes across the viewport.  Her mission: to chart unexplored systems and locate potential habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – but the thrill of discovery, the allure of the uncharted, burned as brightly as ever in her heart.
