
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and treacherous mountain passes.  Bandits lurked in shadowy forests, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each day brought new challenges – a ford swollen by relentless rain, a crumbling bridge threatening to send them tumbling into the abyss, the gnawing hunger in their bellies.  Yet, the unwavering faith fueling their quest, coupled with the thrill of the unknown, kept them moving relentlessly towards their hallowed destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with strange and wondrous flora.  Warp jumps across vast distances of space were commonplace, yet each one presented its own unique risks – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks. The challenges were different, the scale immense, but the spirit of adventure, the hunger for discovery, burned just as brightly in Eva's heart as it had in Sir Kaelan's.  The cosmos, like the medieval world, offered endless possibilities, and she embraced them all.
