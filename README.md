
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting wind.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys before winter’s grip truly tightened, felt increasingly improbable with each fallen tree and treacherous ravine.  Bandits, rumored to haunt these woods, were a constant threat, adding to the already daunting challenges of navigating unfamiliar terrain and dwindling supplies.  Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal flickering weakly across the vast gulf of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes was routine, but the psychic echoes emanating from the nebula were a new challenge.  They whispered of forgotten civilizations and cosmic horrors, a chilling counterpoint to the hum of her ship’s engines.  The vastness of space, while exhilarating, was also deeply isolating, making the human connection with her crew all the more precious in this lonely exploration of the galaxy.
