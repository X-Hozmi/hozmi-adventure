
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind the creaking wagon wheels as Elara and her brother, Thomas, traverse the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, the roads are treacherous, and the constant threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – navigating unfamiliar terrain, bartering for supplies in strange villages, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers.  Yet, with every sunrise, their determination burns brighter, fueled by faith and a shared thirst for adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* across the vast gulf between Andromeda and the Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet within the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in years of sublight travel, punctuated by brief periods of faster-than-light jumps.  The crew faces the constant threat of equipment malfunctions, cosmic radiation, and the unknown dangers of unexplored space.  But the lure of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, is a powerful force, driving them ever onward into the inky black.
