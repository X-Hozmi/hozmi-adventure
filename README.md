
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The journey across the splintered lands of Aquitaine was arduous; muddy tracks gave way to sun-baked plains, each day bringing new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to overwhelm them.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred him onward, a flicker of hope burning against the encroaching darkness.  He rode towards the unknown, his fate intertwined with the destiny of his kingdom.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic hyperspace jump.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory K'tharr cruisers was a daily routine, the endless expanse of space both terrifying and breathtaking.  Each jump through the warp gate was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the possibility of reuniting with the lost colonists, of uncovering the secrets of their disappearance, fuelled her unwavering determination.  The cosmos held its breath as she continued her perilous quest.
