
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the muddy track, the chill wind whipping my cloak around me as I traverse the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in taverns and sung of by bards – a place of unimaginable wealth and ancient magic.  Each creak of my saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for both breathtaking discovery and deadly peril. Bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable elements themselves are constant companions on this arduous journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a lullaby against the backdrop of infinite starlight.  We traverse the Andromeda Galaxy, charting unexplored nebulae and mapping uncatalogued planets. My mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, a place rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The thrill of the unknown is matched only by the terrifying vastness of space;  a single malfunction could mean oblivion in the inky blackness between worlds.  The journey is a gamble, but the potential rewards for humanity outweigh the risk.
