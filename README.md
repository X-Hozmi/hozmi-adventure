
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort against the relentless chill.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the lingering plague.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the Duke of Burgundy, was fraught with peril, but the weight of responsibility spurred him on, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of village life and sprawling castles he passed along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassurance against the vast, unknowable emptiness of space.  But the journey wasn't without its own brand of danger – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of uncharted systems tested her skill and courage as she pressed onward, her sights set on securing a future for humanity among the stars.
