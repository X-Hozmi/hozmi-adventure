
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid delivered to a distant monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the unwavering glint in her eyes spoke of a determination forged in necessity, fuelled by the unwavering spirit of adventure that pushed her ever onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the far reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the territorial claims of space pirates, his crew relied on cutting-edge technology and unshakeable camaraderie.  The vast expanse of space held unimaginable wonders, but also untold dangers, pushing the limits of human endurance and testing the boundaries of their courage.
