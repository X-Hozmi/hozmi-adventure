
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city of gold and magic, guarded by treacherous mountains and even more treacherous bandits.  His small band, a motley crew of mercenary knights and a surprisingly nimble cartographer, pressed on, driven by greed, glory, and a desperate need to escape the failing harvest back home. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of either untold riches or a gruesome end.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the navigation console.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna and rumored to house a long-lost civilization.  The vast emptiness of space, the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and pirate raids, were small price to pay for the potential rewards – and the thrill of charting the unmapped edges of the galaxy.
