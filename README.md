The King's writ, a crumpled scroll clutched in his sweaty hand, promised riches and glory in the far-off lands beyond the whispering forests.  Each creak of his saddle, each flash of steel from the mercenary band beside him, underscored the perilous journey ahead.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked at every turn, making this pilgrimage a gamble against the odds for a chance at fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space surrounding her. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unseen dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown sentient life.  The vastness of the cosmos offered unimaginable rewards, but also held the potential for utter annihilation.
