
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary in a distant monastery whispered on a tattered parchment.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the unwavering glint in her eyes reflects a spirit unbent, fueled by the burning need for survival and a sliver of faith in a better tomorrow.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human civilization.  The vastness of space presented its own challenges – treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  But Nova, hardened by years of exploration and fueled by an insatiable curiosity, navigated the cosmos with unwavering courage, her sights set on the limitless horizons of the universe and the promise of discovery.
