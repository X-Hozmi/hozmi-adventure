
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a fool's errand some called it, had sent him across the kingdom to find the mythical Sunstone, a jewel said to hold the power to banish the creeping blight from the land.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the hope of salvation spurred him on through forests haunted by whispers and across rivers swollen with spring thaw.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow reflecting in the viewport of her starship, 'Stardust'.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  The jump gates flickered, unreliable portals through the vastness of space, and each successful transit brought the chilling realization of how truly alone they were in the cosmos.  But the faint signal, a desperate plea for help echoing across light years, was a beacon guiding her through the treacherous currents of interstellar travel and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.
