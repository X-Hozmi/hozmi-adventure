
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother's life spurred her onward, through sun-baked plains and treacherous mountain passes, a testament to the unwavering human spirit in the face of medieval hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the Xylossian Collective, a journey spanning light years and countless unexplored systems.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of warp core failure. But the human drive for exploration remained, fueled by the promise of new worlds, new knowledge, and the relentless push towards the infinite frontier of space.
