
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Days blurred into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of losing his way in the vast, unforgiving wilderness. Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the desperate hope of returning home a hero.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow painting her starship's cockpit in an eerie light.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps consumed days, punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the distant whispers of cosmic radiation.  Facing treacherous asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel, Elara pressed on, driven by the unwavering hope of finding her lost kin and bringing them home.
