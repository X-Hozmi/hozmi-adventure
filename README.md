
The year is 1348.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Carcassonne, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for a deadly encounter.  His survival depended not only on his swordsmanship but on his resilience, his knowledge of the land, and a hefty dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems were all in a day's work. The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than a medieval forest, a chilling loneliness punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Her success depended on her piloting skill, her crew's loyalty, and the advanced technology they commanded.
