
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each day brings the thrill of the unknown: the hushed awe of ancient ruins glimpsed at dawn, the tense standoff with a band of brigands in a shadowed forest, the vibrant chaos of a bustling medieval city where silks from the East mingle with the roughspun wool of the West.  The whispered legends of mythical beasts and hidden treasures fuel our journey, a constant reminder of the unpredictable beauty and danger that lie beyond the next crest of the hill.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' leaps across the void between galaxies, each jump a gamble against the capricious nature of hyperspace.  We trade not silks and spices but advanced technologies and knowledge gleaned from alien civilizations, encountering sentient nebulae, navigating asteroid fields, and sometimes, facing the wrath of hostile empires.  The universe is a vast and unpredictable ocean, and our journey, a thrilling, often perilous exploration of its infinite wonders.
