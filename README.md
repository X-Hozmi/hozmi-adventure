
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's retinue crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before them. Their journey across the blighted lands to reach the Sultan's court had been fraught with peril; bandits ambushing from shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered promise of untold riches and the Sultan's legendary lost city fuelled their weary steps, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a prayer for survival.  The adventure, however dangerous, was a vital part of their lives, the only path to glory and fortune in a world defined by brute force and feudal duty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, the navigation charts incomplete and the potential for encountering unknown spatial anomalies immense.  But the promise of discovering a new habitable world, rich in resources and teeming with unexplored alien life, outweighed the danger. Each hyperspace jump was a leap of faith, a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime, yet the thrill of galactic exploration, the quest to push humanity's boundaries, was a siren song that lured her onward.
