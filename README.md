
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his once-gleaming armor dulled, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had tested their mettle, every mile a battle against tangled undergrowth, muddy trails, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing a relic of immense power, fueled their arduous trek, a promise of glory and salvation against the encroaching plague that ravaged the land. Each creak of the saddle and rustle in the leaves heightened the sense of adventure, a constant reminder of the unknown dangers and potential rewards that lay ahead.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic navigational charts left by a long-dead civilization.  With a crew of seasoned explorers at her side,  Eva faced the vastness of space, her heart pounding with the thrill of discovery, knowing that the rewards – and the risks – of interstellar travel were beyond measure.
