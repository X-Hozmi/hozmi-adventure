
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow clinging to the biting wind.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, the unforgiving terrain threatened to swallow her whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each arduous step, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a burning ember against the chill of the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  The journey was less about physical hardship and more a test of patience; traversing light-years demanded careful navigation through asteroid fields, the constant vigilance against rogue space debris, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the promise of discovery far outweighed any risk.
