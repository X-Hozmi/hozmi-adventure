
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône Valley, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to the wind.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of healing fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, uncertain darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* sliced through the nebula of Xylos, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their mission. Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, but the true adventure lay in the unknown.  The thrill of discovering new life, new worlds, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweighed the calculated risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of the cosmos.
