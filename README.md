
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the snow-covered peaks of the Alps.  My destination: Constantinople, a fabled city shimmering like a jewel at the edge of the known world.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous passes, ravenous wolves, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands and cultures, fueled my weary steps. Every sunset brought a breathtaking vista, a reward for the day's struggles, and a promise of more adventures to come.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we jumped between galaxies, a tiny vessel against the unimaginable vastness of space. Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a hundred planets after a catastrophic warp-storm. Each planet presented a unique and perilous landscape, from the lava-choked plains of Ignis to the sentient fungal forests of Mycelium.  The dangers were alien and terrifying, but the potential discovery of a lost civilization, and the unraveling of its secrets, spurred us onward.
