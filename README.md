
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold healing powers, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resilience, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her every step.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the distant shrine, fueled her onward, a testament to human spirit's capacity for endurance and hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held wonders beyond imagining – alien landscapes, bizarre celestial phenomena, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, civilizations.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration, overshadowed the dangers, driving Eva and her crew ever further into the cosmic unknown.
