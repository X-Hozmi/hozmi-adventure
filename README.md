
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Her quest, to reach the legendary Sunstone monastery, was fraught with peril, but the whispered promise of healing its abbot could offer her ailing brother fueled her onward.  She faced blizzards that threatened to bury her alive and bandits who sought to relieve her of her meager possessions, yet the breathtaking vistas and the kindness of strangers in isolated villages offered moments of respite and renewed resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  While the dangers were less visceral than Elara's, they were no less daunting.  Nebula storms threatened to fry her ship's systems, and the derelict station itself was a labyrinth of malfunctioning machinery and potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  But the lure of scientific discovery, and the potential for advancement in interstellar travel, kept her engines humming, pushing her ever further into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
