
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself being constant threats.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a faster-than-light route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of hull breaches in the face of cosmic radiation.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the most ambitious terrestrial explorations.  Yet, the thrill of charting the unknown, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, drove her and her crew, tiny specks of light against the unimaginable grandeur of the cosmos.
