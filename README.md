
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hangs in the air, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague that rages back in her village. Her quest – to reach the legendary healer in the distant mountains – is a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: navigating dense forests, fording icy rivers, and bartering for food and shelter with wary villagers.  Her journey is a testament to human resilience, a gamble against the odds for a sliver of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast distances between planets are commonplace, but the jump to a new galaxy is unprecedented.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding hostile alien patrols is a daily struggle. Her mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace. The vast, unforgiving expanse of space presents a constant threat – malfunctioning engines, rogue space debris, and unseen cosmic phenomena. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to unravel ancient mysteries, and the hope of finding something beyond human comprehension fuels her voyage through the infinite blackness.
