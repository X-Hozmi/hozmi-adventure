
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the spires of Avignon a distant shimmer in the Provençal sun. Her journey, begun months ago in the shadowed forests of Bavaria, was far from over.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the plague that stalked the land.  But the whispers of a lost city, a city of untold riches and ancient magic, fueled her onward.  She carried a worn map, a compass that sometimes spun wildly, and a heart brimming with both hope and trepidation.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been harrowing, a risky gamble to reach the fabled Kryll homeworld, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The ship, battered and bruised from asteroid fields and solar flares, hummed with the strain of its powerful engines.  Eva, hardened by countless voyages across the vast expanse of space, felt the familiar thrill of the unknown mingled with the heavy responsibility of her crew. The fate of humanity, it seemed, rested on her ability to navigate the treacherous currents of the cosmos and reach Kryll before their rivals.
