
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin.  The journey to the Sultan's court is fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience.  His quest, to retrieve a stolen relic, fuels his weary legs and sharpens his focus amidst the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through a swirling nebula, its vibrant colours painting the viewport in a kaleidoscope of light. Her mission: to establish contact with a newly discovered sentient species on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey is measured in light years, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the rhythmic beep of the navigational system.  Challenges are different here – navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp core breaches, and facing the unknown intelligences that may lie beyond the stars.  But like Sir Gareth before her, Captain Rostova's dedication drives her across the cosmic expanse.
