
The year is 1348.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, through sun-drenched valleys and windswept plains, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory space pirates of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva and her crew faced dangers far removed from medieval skirmishes.  Warp drives hummed, sensors scanned the void for signs of life, and the vast, breathtaking expanse of space both humbled and inspired them on their perilous interstellar journey.
