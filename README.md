
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her horse picks its way across the unforgiving terrain.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her perilous journey, but the whispers of ancient magic and untold riches fuel her relentless pursuit across the harsh, unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony demanded unwavering focus and split-second decisions. The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of peril than Elara's medieval journey, a lonely battle against the infinite unknown. Yet, the promise of unlocking galactic exploration propelled Eva forward, echoing the same intrepid spirit that drove Elara across the medieval world.
