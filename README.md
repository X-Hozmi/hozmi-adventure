
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his mount onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem felt endless, a tapestry woven with sun-baked dust, the stench of stagnant marshes, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new hardship – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the constant gnawing anxiety of the unknown. Yet, the lure of the Holy Land, the whispered legends of ancient wonders, and the unwavering faith in his heart fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  But unlike the medieval pilgrims, Eva possessed technology to navigate the cosmos, her ship a testament to humanity's relentless curiosity. The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a breathtaking beauty that mirrored, in its own grand scale, the medieval traveler's awe of the unknown world.
