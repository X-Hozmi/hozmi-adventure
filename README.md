
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the grueling rhythm of travel: the creak of saddle leather, the rasp of his horse's breath, the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing uncertainty of the vast, unknown landscape stretching before him. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset a reminder of the perilous journey still ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the journey was far from effortless.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate fleets, and maintaining the fragile ecosystem of the ship demanded constant vigilance and skill.  The rewards, however, promised to be worth the risk – a new habitable planet, rich with resources and the potential for a new beginning for humanity, lay at the edge of the known universe.
