
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags as my destrier lumbers across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a formidable barrier on my journey to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Whispers of its gold-paved streets and enchanted artifacts fuel my weary legs, pushing me onward through bandit-ridden forests and across treacherous river crossings.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the allure of the unknown keeps me pushing forward, a lone adventurer in a vast, unforgiving world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is my constant companion.  Stars streak past the viewport, a cosmic river flowing towards the Andromeda galaxy.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope in a sea of unexplored nebulae and hostile alien territories.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating; each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove or deadly trap.  The journey is fraught with danger, but the potential discovery of a new civilization, a new beginning, makes the risk worthwhile.
