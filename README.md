
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried rations and a brittle map, its ink threatening to bleed into the parchment.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a mythical place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, a place promising untold riches and even greater dangers.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula's iridescent veil, leaving behind the swirling chaos of the Crab Cluster.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet teeming with sentient flora and rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey had already spanned years, fraught with near-misses with rogue asteroids and tense encounters with space pirates. But the potential reward—unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel and bringing untold prosperity to her people—fueled her unwavering determination to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.
