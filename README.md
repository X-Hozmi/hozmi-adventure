
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's steed as he traverses the sun-baked plains of France, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the oppressive heat.  Ahead lies the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the whispers of untold riches and ancient magic spur him onward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed resolve to reach his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and awe-inspiring;  each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each alien system a potential threat.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, fuels her crew's relentless pursuit.  The cold, sterile environment of the ship contrasts sharply with the burning passion within her – a thirst for the unknown that mirrors the medieval knight's, yet propelled by a different kind of magic: the power of science and exploration.
