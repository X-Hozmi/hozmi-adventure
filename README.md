
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, his quest a perilous journey to retrieve a sacred relic stolen by Saracens.  Each night brought the chilling whispers of wolves and the distant clang of bandit swords, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the flickering flames of his campfire.  The road was fraught with hardship, yet the allure of adventure, the chance to prove his valor, spurred him ever onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast gulf between galaxies. The hyperdrive hummed a low, comforting drone, a stark contrast to the swirling nebulae and distant, alien suns visible through her viewport.  Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora.  While lacking the immediate physical threats of Kaelan's journey, the loneliness of interstellar space and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien civilizations presented a unique and daunting adventure of a different scale.
