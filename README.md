
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling my lungs.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised twilight sky, a daunting but necessary passage on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions, but the whispered promises of unimaginable riches and forgotten knowledge fuel my weary steps. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a testament to my resilience in this unforgiving, yet breathtaking, medieval world.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant lullaby as we traverse the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The star-strewn canvas outside my viewport is both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the sheer scale of the cosmos dwarfs even the grandest medieval ambitions. Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology beyond our comprehension.  The risks are monumental – warp storms, alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failure – yet the potential rewards, the chance to rewrite history, propel us forward into the uncharted territories of the future.
