
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in silks and spices, a desperate gamble to pay off his family's debt.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for banditry, disease, or worse.  His journey across the breadth of Europe promised riches, but the path was fraught with peril, a constant dance between survival and the unpredictable whims of fortune.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, its vibrant colours painting her cockpit in ethereal light.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage of discovery amongst uncharted planets and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  The risks were different, the dangers far grander –  radiation storms, warp core malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown sentient life. Yet, the thirst for exploration burned as brightly as the distant stars, propelling her across the vast emptiness of space.
