
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the whispered tales of miracles at the cathedral, the thrill of encountering different cultures and languages, and the sheer freedom of the open road fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new adventures and breathtaking vistas.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of cosmic dust and newborn stars.  His mission: to retrieve a rare element from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from the bustling spaceports of New Terra.  The journey was a far cry from Elara's, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace. But the vastness of the cosmos, the breathtaking beauty of uncharted systems, and the thrill of discovering the unknown offered a similar siren song, beckoning him across the infinite expanse.
