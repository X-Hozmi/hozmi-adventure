
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Rome to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was far from easy.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, and the rough terrain tested both her strength and her resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, scorching deserts, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, making each hardship another notch on the belt of her growing adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored galactic space.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  The vast distances and alien landscapes were both breathtaking and terrifying, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos. Yet, the lure of the unknown, and the promise of new discoveries, spurred him and his crew on, making the galaxy their boundless playground.
