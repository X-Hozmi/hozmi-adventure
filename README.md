
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking step brought her closer to the fabled monastery, whispered to hold the secret to its cultivation, but also closer to the dangers lurking in the shadowed forests and treacherous mountain passes; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her adventure was a desperate gamble, a journey fueled by hope and the unwavering love for her people.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light years of treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted space.  Advanced technology shielded her from the cosmic dangers, but the loneliness of interstellar travel and the unknown challenges waiting on the other side were a different kind of peril entirely.  The vast expanse of space held both wonder and terrifying unknown quantities; a true test of her courage and skill.
