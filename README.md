
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, the salt spray clinging to our clothes as we set sail for the Holy Land.  Weeks bled into months, the endless blue of the Mediterranean giving way to the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Levant.  We traversed dusty plains under the relentless sun, our caravan a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, always wary of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce provisions in dusty villages, and facing the constant threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  The Althea, our generation starship, a vessel of shimmering chrome and humming engines, cut a path through the inky blackness.  We journeyed light years to Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the red glow of its parent star.  The challenges were different this time – navigating asteroid fields, enduring the prolonged effects of interstellar travel, and facing the unknown alien ecosystems of a new world.  But the thrill of discovery, the boundless possibilities of uncharted space, fueled our journey as surely as the hope of salvation had driven our medieval predecessors.
