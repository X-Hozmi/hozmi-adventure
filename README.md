
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions push onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Days bleed into weeks, filled with skirmishes against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of their courage and loyalty, as they venture deeper into the unknown heart of the wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, charts unmapped nebulae and encounters alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  The journey is fraught with peril – from unstable wormholes to hostile sentient space flora – but the promise of discovery fuels their relentless pursuit of knowledge and the potential to uncover lost histories across the cosmos.  Their adventure transcends the limitations of time and space, pushing the boundaries of human understanding.
