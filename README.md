
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward through the muddy tracks of France.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, disease, or worse.  Our quest: to deliver a sacred relic to a distant abbey, a journey fraught with peril but vital to our faith.  We navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers, and bartered our way through bustling market towns, each day a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, silver Althea cuts a silent path through the nebula, its engines humming a low, reassuring song.  Our mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey requiring precise calculations and unwavering courage.  We navigate asteroid fields, grapple with unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and contend with the ever-present threat of pirate raids, facing dangers unimaginable to our medieval ancestors, yet thrilling in their cosmic scope.
