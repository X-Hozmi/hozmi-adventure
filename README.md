
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  He relied on the kindness of strangers, the guidance of ancient maps, and his own unwavering resolve to reach his goal before it was too late.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled his every step.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and untold dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems became commonplace.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien lifeforms. Yet, the thought of the colonists, their fate unknown, spurred her onward, the vast emptiness of space a stark but captivating backdrop to her perilous voyage.
