
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadow of whispering forests. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, swollen rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of illness.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the unwavering faith that fueled their steps made the arduous trek a testament to human endurance and the allure of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a breathtaking ballet of hyperspace jumps and deft navigation around asteroid fields and hostile alien patrols.  While lacking the visceral immediacy of medieval travel, the technological marvel of interstellar flight offered a different kind of adventure, one that pitted human ingenuity against the vast, unforgiving expanse of space, a constant dance between the calculated risk and the awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos.
