
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  But the promise of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled their relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip apart their ship, while unknown alien lifeforms lurked in the inky blackness between stars. Yet, the lure of discovery, the hope of finding the lost colonists, propelled them forward, a tiny speck of human ambition against the unimaginable vastness of space.
