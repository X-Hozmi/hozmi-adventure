
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey's success, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless advance across the unforgiving expanse of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were mere inconveniences compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the fiercely independent Orion Arm Consortium. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held dangers far more subtle and insidious than any medieval bandit, for the unknown lurked in every unexplored star system.
