The muddy track snaked through the whispering pines, a ribbon of brown against the vibrant green of the untamed forest.  Each bend held the promise of peril – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, wild beasts in the thickets, or the unpredictable whims of nature herself.

Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery kept her pushing forward.
