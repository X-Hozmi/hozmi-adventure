
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains of the Steppe, a stark contrast to the rumors of lush vineyards and bustling cities that lay ahead in the mythical land of Samarkand.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of the dry grass, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the lingering shadow of the plague that stalked the land. His journey was a gamble, a desperate quest for fortune, glory, and perhaps, survival itself.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a daily routine.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held more mysteries than answers, and the dangers of radiation storms and alien encounters were ever-present.  Eva's journey was a testament to human ambition, a daring exploration into the unknown depths of the cosmos.
