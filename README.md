
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fuelled by the hope of a miraculous salvation waiting at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the distant Alpha Centauri system and the burgeoning galactic federation.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of neutron stars was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos was a constant reminder of the scale of her undertaking, a journey that could reshape the destiny of countless worlds.
