
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the King's ailing son.  Their journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the dangers of a world untamed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the relentless gaze of distant suns was a daily struggle.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the indifference of the cosmos.  Yet, the hope of finding the colonists, of bringing them home, fueled her unwavering spirit.
