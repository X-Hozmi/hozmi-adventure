He'd traded the relative safety of his castle walls for the whispered promise of El Dorado, a city of gold rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Thousands of light-years from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.

The risks were unimaginable – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving void. But Eva, seasoned explorer that she was, pressed onward, driven by the hope of finding not gold, but a future free from conflict.
