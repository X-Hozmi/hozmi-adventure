
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to escape the encroaching plague and find a new life in the rumored fertile lands of the east.  Each creak of the wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for both peril and promise – bandits, starvation, or perhaps, unexpected kindness from a passing stranger. The journey was fraught with hardship, but the lure of a better tomorrow pushed her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as they navigated treacherous nebulae and asteroid fields, charting unknown systems in search of habitable planets.  The vastness of space held an almost terrifying beauty, each shimmering star a distant sun with the potential for life, or death.  Ryla's crew, a ragtag band of explorers bound by a shared thirst for discovery, faced dangers far removed from the medieval world – cosmic radiation, rogue gravitational forces, and alien encounters that could either elevate humanity or extinguish it.
