
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the biting wind whipping at her cloak.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the fabled city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain paths tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any knight's sword. Yet, the whispers of Eldoria's arcane libraries and the promise of a cure for her ailing brother spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexx 'Jax' Jackson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of pirate attacks, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel were challenges far removed from the medieval world, but the human spirit's thirst for discovery remained unchanged, propelling Jax toward the unknown with unwavering resolve.
