
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was a relentless test of endurance.  Days blurred into a monotonous rhythm of aching muscles, meager rations, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching the next village, a fleeting respite from the hardships, but the vast, unpredictable landscape held far more challenges than comfort.  They travelled with a small retinue of others bound for the same destination; a shared burden easing the weight of their solitary journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Starseeker,' her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The hyperspace jump had thrown the ship violently, but now the swirling nebula of Xylos unfolded before them, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust and incandescent gas. Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage that would take generations.  Though shielded by advanced technology, the dangers were no less real – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile life forms.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness than the medieval traveler ever faced; a cold, echoing solitude that stretched beyond human comprehension.
