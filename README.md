
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Reginald's throat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling specter of death itself.  He pressed on, driven by a desperate hope stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming algae to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar freighter captain.  But the loneliness of the vast cosmos, the sheer scale of the unknown, was a constant companion, a silent pressure that weighed heavier than any cargo.
