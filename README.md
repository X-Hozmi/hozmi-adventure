
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, and the desperate hope for his sister, fueled his relentless journey across the sprawling, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for human colonization.  Vast distances and unpredictable celestial events were the constant companions of her interstellar voyages.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the thrill of discovery, the potential for breathtaking new worlds, but also the ever-present danger of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations, a far greater risk than any medieval bandit.
