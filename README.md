
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village he’d fled.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse, but the hope of salvation propelled him across the treacherous landscape, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking cosmic panorama outside her viewport. Though the dangers were different—gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders—the thrill of exploration burned as brightly as the distant suns.  Eva, like Thomas before her, was driven by a powerful yearning for discovery, a hunger to push the boundaries of the known.
