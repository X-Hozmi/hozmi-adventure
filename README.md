
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean still clinging to our clothes as we turned our backs on the sea and headed inland.  A rickety cart, laden with meager supplies and the weight of our ambitions, was our sole companion on the dusty track north.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving stretches of barren plains, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Prague, whispered of in hushed tones across taverns, kept us pushing onward, fuelled by dreams of fortune and adventure.


Centuries later, the Althea, a starship honed from starlight and ambition, sliced through the inky blackness of the void.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson glow of its red dwarf sun, light years away from the familiar comfort of Earth.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks and breathtaking vistas - nebulae painted across the cosmos like divine brushstrokes, and asteroid fields navigated with the precision of a seasoned surgeon. The thrill wasn't just in reaching our destination, but in the sheer audacity of traversing the unimaginable distances, pushing the boundaries of human exploration into uncharted territories.
