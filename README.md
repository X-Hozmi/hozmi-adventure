
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking occasionally into the muddy tracks.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, and navigating treacherous mountain passes. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the hope of Eldoria, and the unwavering loyalty of his men, kept Reginald's spirits high.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking cosmic display.  Their mission: a perilous survey of a newly discovered star system potentially harboring habitable planets.  The journey, a months-long odyssey across lightyears of space, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive, the occasional asteroid field, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new worlds, fuelled Eva's unwavering dedication to the mission.
