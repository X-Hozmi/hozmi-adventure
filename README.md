
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small company pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering determination.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a spacetime anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Elara relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's advanced technology. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond anything a medieval traveler could imagine, yet the human drive for exploration – the thirst for the unknown – remained the same, a constant across time and space.
