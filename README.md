His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  rivers ran swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed every step. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, a promise of the unknown, spurred him on, each aching muscle a testament to the vast adventure unfolding.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of gravitational anomalies and hostile alien territories.

The weight of exploration, of charting the unknown for humanity's future, rested heavily on her shoulders, a burden lightened only by the unwavering spirit of her crew.
