
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue crested the windswept pass, their horses' hooves jarring loose pebbles that tumbled down the mountainside.  Ahead, the sprawling, obsidian peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between them and the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a city said to hold untold riches and arcane secrets.  Each day brought new peril: treacherous terrain, skirmishes with brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled them forward, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faintest whisper of gravitonic waves.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike anything humanity had ever encountered.  The journey, spanning light-years, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive, punctuated by the quiet awe of gazing at constellations unknown to Earth.  The risks were immense – hostile alien life, equipment malfunctions, and the ever-present void – but the promise of discovery fueled their daring expedition across the cosmic ocean.
