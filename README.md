
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the battlefield he'd just left. His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril through bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, sharing meager rations with his weary companions, and constantly vigilant against ambush.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and countless uncharted systems.  Facing down cosmic storms, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and battling malfunctioning systems were just a taste of the dangers.  But the allure of the unknown, the chance to discover new life and worlds, fueled her onward through the inky blackness, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the vast, awe-inspiring cosmos.
