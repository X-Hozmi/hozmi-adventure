
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had transformed into a desperate race against time and bandits. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for danger, but the lure of the sacred city, and the whispered promise of miracles, spurred him on.  The road was a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust painting her viewport in breathtaking hues. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational pull of black holes and dodging pirate ships was all in a day’s work for a seasoned spacefarer like Eva.  The vastness of the cosmos, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the same seductive danger as the medieval roads, a promise of untold riches and harrowing peril in equal measure.
