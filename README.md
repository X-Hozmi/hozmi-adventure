The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless heat and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the legendary City of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and magical artifacts, kept him pushing forward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship’s hyperdrive to its limits, but the potential reward – a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – was too enticing to ignore.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae and the cold, hard gleam of stars, held a different kind of danger than the medieval wilds, but the thrill of exploration, the unknown possibilities stretching before her, burned just as brightly.
