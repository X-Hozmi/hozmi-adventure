
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions – a chipped map, a worn prayer book, and a dagger – but her heart held a greater treasure: the yearning for the fabled city of Alexandria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were all obstacles in her quest, yet the thrill of the unknown propelled her forward, each sunrise a new chapter in her daring adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the chilling emptiness of space, and the weight of her crew's lives rested on her shoulders, yet the limitless expanse of the cosmos, brimming with potential discovery, ignited a fire in her soul – a fire as bright and unwavering as the stars themselves.
