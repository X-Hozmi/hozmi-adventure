
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a perilous journey fraught with bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a desperate scramble for shelter, forcing him to rely on his wits, his sword, and the kindness of strangers as fleeting as desert mirages.  The reward?  Perhaps a king's gratitude, perhaps nothing but a grave beneath a cold, indifferent sky.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp drives hummed,  asteroids whizzed past like deadly fireflies, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her crew.  Alien encounters – some friendly, some hostile – were a constant threat, along with the ever-present danger of equipment failure and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The potential discovery of a new civilization, or the chilling prospect of finding only ruins, made this a voyage fraught with uncertainty, a gamble on the very edge of known space.
