
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, laden with silks and spices destined for the court of the King of Aragon.  Across the sun-baked plains of Provence, our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, crawled toward the Pyrenees.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of disease and starvation. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of discovery spurred us onward, a relentless pull toward the unknown lands beyond the mountains. The clang of our horses' hooves echoed our own beating hearts, a symphony of adventure played out against the vast canvas of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Cygnus X-1 system tested our ship's resilience and our own nerves.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the solar systems, faced the unknown with a mixture of apprehension and exhilaration.  We traversed the cosmos, a tiny vessel against the immensity of space, fueled by the same indomitable human spirit that drove those medieval travelers, only our destination lay not in a distant kingdom, but amidst the stars themselves.
