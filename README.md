
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, bounced against her back.  This journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits roamed the shadowed passes, and whispers of monstrous beasts echoed in the valleys.  But the lure of forgotten magic and untold riches spurred her on, each creak of her saddle a reminder of the adventure unfolding.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the immense distances conquered.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships.  Yet, for Eva, the thrill of exploration, of charting unknown territories among a tapestry of stars, far outweighed the risks.
