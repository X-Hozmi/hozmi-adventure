
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure carried on the wind, propelled him forward, each sunrise a promise of a new, unpredictable encounter.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy during a catastrophic warp jump.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation, Eva and her crew faced challenges that dwarfed those of any medieval explorer.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of uncharted nebulae, and the thrill of discovery fueled their journey, making every light-year a step towards the unknown.
