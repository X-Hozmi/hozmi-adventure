
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust devils in the fading light.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creaking cart, each weary rider, represented a gamble against starvation, bandit raids, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled their relentless march eastward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal desperately faint but hinting at their survival.   Hyperspace jumps were risky, fraught with gravitational anomalies and pirate incursions, but the potential for reunion with long-lost kin outweighed the danger.  The vastness of space held mysteries both wondrous and terrifying, but Eva’s resolve, fueled by the hope of finding her people, remained unshaken.
