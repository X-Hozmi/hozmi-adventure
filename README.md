
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier to my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors whispered of untold riches and ancient magic within its walls, enough to entice even the most hardened traveler to brave the treacherous passes, the lurking bandits, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume me with every passing day.  My only companions were my trusty sword, a dwindling supply of dried meat, and the burning hope that fuelled my weary limbs.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the bridge.  My destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey had taken years, a blur of cryo-sleep punctuated by the breathtaking sight of nebulae and the unsettling silence of deep space.  Xylos promised not gold or magic, but answers.  Answers to the enigma of the ancient Xylosian civilization, their sudden disappearance leaving behind only enigmatic ruins and tantalizing whispers of advanced technology that could reshape the fate of humanity.  The risks were immense – unknown lifeforms, volatile atmospheric conditions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the potential rewards outweighed even the vast distances and inherent dangers.
