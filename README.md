
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a few meager coins, a map stained with the sweat of countless journeys, and the whispered promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the Black Forest.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled her onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to establish contact with a newly discovered sentient species on the planet Kepler-186f, a world light years from her own.  The vast distances were nothing compared to the challenges – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failure.  But the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, and the weight of her responsibility fueled her resolve as she charted a course through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
