
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood, a grim reminder of the bandit ambush two days past.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister – led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense forests haunted by wolves, and along rivers teeming with pirates. Each sunrise brought new peril, but the unwavering hope for his sister fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, leaving the crew disoriented and the ship shuddering, but the breathtaking vista of countless galaxies swirling before them made the risk worthwhile.  Their mission – to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f – demanded traversing the vast, unpredictable expanse of the cosmos.  Each jump was a gamble, each star system a potential hazard, yet the promise of finding their missing brethren spurred them onwards through the endless, glittering void.
