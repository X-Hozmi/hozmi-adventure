
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Gareth, his armour clanking, urged his weary mount onward.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – fording raging rivers, navigating dense forests teeming with unseen dangers, and the constant gnawing anxiety of dwindling supplies.  The quest for redemption and the whispered legends of a lost Crusader relic spurred him on, a flicker of hope against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was equally fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the constant hum of the ship’s engines a constant reminder of their fragile existence in the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding life beyond Earth, fuelled her unwavering determination, a modern echo of the medieval knight's quest.
