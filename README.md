
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already conquered and the many more to come.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a familiar comfort amidst the constant threat of bandits and the unpredictable whims of nature.  My destination: the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold riches beyond imagining.  Every sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown, a challenge to my endurance and a test of my courage, with the promise of legendary stories to tell upon my return, assuming I ever did.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we leap across the vast chasm separating the Andromeda Galaxy from our own.  Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a legend echoing across millennia.  The view from the cockpit, a swirling kaleidoscope of nebulae and distant suns, is breathtaking, yet the weight of the unknown, the sheer scale of the universe, keeps me constantly on edge, a thrilling counterpoint to the hum of the engines.
