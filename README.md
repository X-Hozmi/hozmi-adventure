
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost knowledge of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, scorching deserts testing the limits of endurance, and whispers of mythical beasts lurking in the shadows.  His meager supplies dwindled, but the thrill of the unknown fueled his weary limbs, the promise of legendary riches and glory a beacon in the encroaching night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey across light-years of cosmic dust and unmapped wormholes.  The ship's AI, a sardonic construct named HALIX, warned of approaching gravitational anomalies and potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  Though shielded by advanced technology, the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of the cosmos instilled a sense of profound isolation and awe, a modern-day adventure that dwarfed even the grandest medieval quests in its scope and inherent danger.
