
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained a king's ransom in smuggled silks and the hope of a new life in a faraway city.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unpredictable wrath of nature.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the pull of distant horizons, fueled her onward, a lone adventurer in a world of unforgiving beauty.


Centuries later, Captain Rex "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space held more danger than any medieval landscape.  But the allure of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories among the stars, outweighed the risks. Razor, a pioneer in the grand tapestry of interstellar exploration, felt the ancient spirit of adventure pulse in his veins – a legacy that transcended time itself.
