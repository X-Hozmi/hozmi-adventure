
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step was a gamble; bandits roamed the unforgiving terrain, and whispered tales of mythical creatures added to the ever-present danger.  Yet, the hope of healing fuelled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula shimmering with impossible colours.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, a constant thrumming reminder of the immense distances traversed.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering unknown alien lifeforms were everyday hazards. But the chance to reunite with long-lost humanity, scattered across the cosmos, burned brighter than any star, guiding her across the unimaginable expanse of space.
