
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: fording raging rivers, navigating dense forests teeming with unknown creatures, and bartering for supplies in dusty, sun-baked villages.  His quest, to retrieve a sacred relic, felt as vast and uncertain as the sprawling landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and jumping across lightyears was commonplace, yet the cosmic unknown held a far greater threat than any medieval bandit.  Uncharted star systems, unpredictable wormholes, and the silent menace of space itself tested the limits of her ship and her courage.  The vast expanse of the galaxy dwarfed even the grandest medieval journey, making her quest for the lost colonists a truly epic adventure.
