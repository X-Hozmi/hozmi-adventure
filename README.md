
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the war-torn kingdom. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach her goal before it was too late.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of her starship a stark contrast to the swirling cosmic canvas surrounding her.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet struggling under a devastating solar flare.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were commonplace dangers, but nothing compared to the silent dread of navigating uncharted sectors, where alien entities lurked, unseen and unknown, in the inky blackness.
