
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, felt endless.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of disease and starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart, fueled by whispered tales of miraculous healing, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Conversely, Captain Ryla's voyage spanned light years, not leagues.  Her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies, the swirling nebulae outside a breathtaking spectacle.  Their mission: to locate a rumored planet teeming with a rare energy source vital to their dying civilization.  While free from the immediate dangers of bandits and famine, Ryla faced the chilling isolation of space, the ever-present threat of system malfunctions, and the daunting uncertainty of finding their destination amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
