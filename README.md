
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his surcoat mud-splattered, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for a devastating plague sweeping his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of the journey itself.  He relied on the kindness of strangers, the guidance of the stars, and the unwavering strength of his spirit to push towards his distant goal.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a daring rescue mission to retrieve a stranded colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a gamble, wormholes unpredictable, and the vast emptiness of space a constant threat.  Yet, fueled by the hope of saving countless lives and the thrill of pushing humanity's boundaries, Eva navigated the treacherous cosmic currents, her courage matched only by the cutting-edge technology that propelled her ship ever onward.
