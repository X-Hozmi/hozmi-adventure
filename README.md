
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under the relentless sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, little more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed ravines, treacherous mountain passes threatening to send both man and beast tumbling into the abyss, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge, pushed him ever forward, the promise of adventure a potent antidote to the bone-deep fatigue.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling solar flares were daily occurrences, a far cry from the mundane routine of Earth's spaceports.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, faced the unknown with a mix of apprehension and excitement, their quest for new life and new civilizations a thrilling gamble against the vast emptiness of space.
