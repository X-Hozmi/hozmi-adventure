Each day brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.

The whispered tales of monstrous beasts and ancient ruins, though frightening, only fueled our burning desire for adventure, for a life beyond the confines of our humble village.


Seven centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a multinational band of explorers bound by a shared thirst for discovery, charted unmapped star systems and cataloged alien flora and fauna.  The risk of encountering hostile civilizations or encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies was a constant companion, yet the allure of first contact, of unraveling the cosmos's mysteries, eclipsed every fear. The vastness of space, teeming with life both wondrous and terrifying, represented the ultimate frontier, a canvas upon which humanity would paint its future.
