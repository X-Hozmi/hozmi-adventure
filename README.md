
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the endless expanse of the French countryside.  Ahead, the Pyrenees loomed, a formidable barrier between me and the promised riches of the Spanish court.  Bandits, disease, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown, the whispers of adventure clinging to every windswept plain, kept me pushing onward.  Every sunrise was a gamble, every sunset a victory, the grand tapestry of my journey woven with equal parts peril and exhilaration.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a far cry from the crunch of gravel.  Stars streaked past the viewport as we leaped across the chasm of interstellar space, bound for Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The risks were different now – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas painted with nebulae and uncharted galaxies, filled me with a sense of wonder that dwarfed even the wildest medieval dreams.
