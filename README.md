
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold secrets lost to time and untold riches.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown pushed him forward, a flicker of hope battling the gnawing uncertainty of the long road ahead.  He dreamt of ancient wonders and the glory that would await his return.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold a key to interstellar travel beyond human comprehension.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, yet the true danger lay in the unknown – alien lifeforms, hostile space pirates, and the chilling vastness of the cosmos itself. The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential rewards of discovering a new world and its secrets outweighed the risks for Eva and her crew.
