
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small company urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of salvation spurred them on, each hardship forging a stronger bond between the knights and fueling their determination to reach their destination.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was routine, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the possibility of encountering unknown, hostile alien civilizations.  Elara, a seasoned explorer, faced the vastness of space with steely resolve, her gaze fixed on the promise of a new dawn for humanity.
