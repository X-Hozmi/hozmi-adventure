
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on their journey across the unforgiving plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of both peril and untold riches, for the road was fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The adventure was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the Kepler-186f system.  The vastness of space held a different kind of danger; asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  But the lure of new worlds, of discovering life beyond Earth, fuelled her journey. The galaxy was her canvas, and the stars, her guiding lights in this grand, cosmic adventure.
