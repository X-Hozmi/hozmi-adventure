
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, spurred his weary horse across the windswept plains.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the snow bit deep, and along sun-baked rivers teeming with both life and peril.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty; the whispers of war, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown fueled their every step. This was a journey not of comfort, but of grit and unwavering faith.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, had been arduous, pushing the ship's systems to their limits.  Now, battling gravitational anomalies and dodging asteroid fields, they were closer than ever to their destination. The vast emptiness of space, though beautiful, was a constant reminder of their isolation, the fragility of their vessel, and the myriad unknown dangers that lurked between the stars.  This was a journey not merely of distance, but of hope and the unrelenting pursuit of a new beginning.
