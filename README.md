
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her horse picks its way through the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead, the rumored city of Zerzura shimmers in the heat haze, a mythical oasis promising riches and escape from the brutal realities of war-torn Europe.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, hints at lurking danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse. Yet, the allure of the unknown fuels her onward, a single woman braving the unforgiving landscape for a chance at a better life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey is fraught with peril; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make every jump a gamble.  But the promise of unlocking faster-than-light travel, of connecting disparate galaxies, is a siren song too powerful to ignore, a risk worth taking for the future of humankind.
