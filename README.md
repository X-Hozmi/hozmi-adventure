
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's summons to the far north, a desperate plea for aid against a marauding horde, had thrown him onto a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains presented treacherous crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast, unforgiving landscape stretching between him and his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been harrowing, the warp drive pushing the vessel to its absolute limit.  Now, navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets became her immediate concern.  The mission – to locate the mythical Xylossian artifacts rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – was a gamble, but the potential rewards outweighed the terrifying odds facing her and her crew in the uncharted reaches of space.
