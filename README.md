
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or disaster – a constant companion on her arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe.

Centuries later,  Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship cutting a lonely path through the inky black.  His mission: to deliver a vital data core across three galaxies, a journey fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the unpredictable warping of spacetime.  While the technology offered unparalleled speed, the vast emptiness of space and the constant threat of the unknown made each hyperspace jump a gamble, a thrilling and terrifying adventure into the uncharted cosmos.
