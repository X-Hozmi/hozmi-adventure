
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she spurred her destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on her and the small caravan.  Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of Ancaria was far from over, each day a gamble against starvation, ambush, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, fuelled her relentless pursuit, a beacon against the bleakness of the journey, promising glory or ruin at its end.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the hyperspace jump.  His mission: to retrieve the lost bio-engine core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The galaxy was a vast, unforgiving expanse, populated by warring factions and unpredictable cosmic phenomena, but the promise of scientific advancement, and a hefty payday, kept the seasoned explorer pushing ever onward into the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
