
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode, the midday sun beating down on his battered armour. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden in the heart of the Sahara.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits ambushing from sun-baked canyons, treacherous sandstorms obscuring the path, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet the lure of the lost city, and the hope of untold riches and glory, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst the cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile pirate factions lurking in the black, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the uncharted reaches of space.  But the courage of the crew, and the knowledge that lives depended on their success, pushed them onward through the endless night of the cosmos.
