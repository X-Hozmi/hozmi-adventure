
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each step was a gamble against the elements and lurking bandits, my meager supplies dwindling with every passing day.  The whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria spurred me onward, a beacon in the swirling snow, promising untold riches and perhaps, even more importantly, escape from the crushing poverty of my village.  The journey was arduous, a constant test of endurance and will, but the thrill of the unknown propelled me forward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we jumped, the destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, buzzed with nervous excitement; the risks were immense, the potential rewards immeasurable.  Alien landscapes, unforeseen dangers, and the possibility of contact with another intelligent species – the vastness of space held infinite possibilities, both terrifying and exhilarating.
