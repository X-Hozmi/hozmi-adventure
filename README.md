
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her horse onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, rumored to hold a lost city and untold riches, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the hope of discovery, but each sunset held the chilling possibility of becoming one with the unforgiving landscape.  Her small band of companions, their faces grim with determination and fear, rode silently beside her, bound by a shared thirst for adventure and a desperate need for fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat deemed impossible by most.  The risks were immense – unstable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present danger of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving void.  But for Jax and her crew, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration across the cosmic ocean, far outweighed the perils that lay ahead in their quest to reach the uncharted territories of the Andromeda galaxy.
