
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised purple sky.  Her worn map, its edges frayed and stained with rain, promised a shortcut to the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, and the whispering wind carried tales of mythical beasts guarding ancient ruins. Yet, the lure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, each creak of the saddle a testament to her unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political intrigue that threatened her mission.  But with a loyal crew and a ship equipped for interstellar travel, Eva was prepared to face any challenge, her gaze fixed on the distant glimmer of a potential new era for humanity.
