
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small caravan struggled onward.  Dust coated everything, blurring the already indistinct horizon.  Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons,  disease stalked the weary travelers, and the endless expanse of desert threatened to swallow them whole. Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the grim reality of their arduous trek, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape for the promise of untold riches and legendary wonders.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned spacers,  were on a mission to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a galaxy far beyond human exploration.  The risks were immense – unstable wormhole currents, uncharted space anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders prowling the outer reaches of known space. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to discover new worlds and civilizations, fueled their courage and spurred them onward across the vast emptiness between stars.
