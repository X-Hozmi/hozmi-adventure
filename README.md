
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry, famine, or worse.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Ys, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon, spurred her onward.  She shared the road with grizzled mercenaries, pious pilgrims, and desperate refugees, each with their own tales and trials in this unforgiving land.  Their shared journey, bound by the same perilous path, forged an unlikely camaraderie amongst them.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship *Stardust* through the nebula of Xylos, her course plotted for the Andromeda galaxy.  Unlike the medieval travelers before her, Ryla’s journey was a calculated dance between hyperspace jumps and gravitational pulls, a symphony of physics and engineering. While bandits were replaced by rogue AI and famine by fuel shortages, the feeling of isolation and the thrill of discovery remained constant.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos held its own set of perils, but the promise of new worlds and the mysteries they held far outweighed the risk.
