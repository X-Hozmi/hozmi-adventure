
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she and her companions crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before them.  Their journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and desperation, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions. Yet, with each sunrise, a stubborn hope bloomed, fueled by whispered legends of the Pope's healing touch and the unwavering camaraderie forged in the crucible of their shared adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned explorers, were on a mission to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae, evading pirate factions, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation were all in a day's work. But the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking galactic secrets, pushed them ever onward, their courage a beacon in the inky blackness of space.
