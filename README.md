He had left his home months ago, seeking glory and fortune in the faraway kingdom.

Captain Lyra stared out the viewport, mesmerized by the swirling colours and the faint glow of distant stars.

Their mission was to explore, to learn, and to push the boundaries of human knowledge, embracing the vastness of the cosmos.
