
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, with each creak of the saddle and each sunrise painting the sky in vibrant hues, her determination burned brighter than the sun, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination and saving her brother's life.  This was more than travel; it was a pilgrimage of faith and fortitude across a land both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates, Rexa and her crew faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers. Yet, the vastness of space, teeming with uncharted wonders and unimaginable dangers, held a similar allure – a promise of discovery and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of the known universe, a journey fueled by scientific curiosity and a thirst for the unknown.
