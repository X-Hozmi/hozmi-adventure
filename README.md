
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Alora, had already tested their endurance.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies had become constant companions. Yet, the whispered tales of miraculous healing, and the unwavering faith burning in Kaelan's heart, spurred them across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise bringing a new challenge, and each sunset the promise of a closer destination, or a final resting place.


Seven centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey, though traversing the vast distances of interstellar space in a hyperdrive-equipped vessel, was fraught with its own dangers.  Uncharted asteroid fields, pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of system failures demanded constant vigilance.  Yet, the promise of life flourishing on a new world, and the weight of humanity's future on her shoulders, fueled Eva's resolve, turning the endless blackness of space into a canvas of intrepid exploration.
