
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under the overcast sky, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred him onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding population.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the journey.  But the potential to discover a new home, a new dawn for humankind, fueled her determination and steered her ship ever closer to the uncharted nebulae at the edge of known space.
