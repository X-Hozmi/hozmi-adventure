
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a chipped map, her only companions the relentless sun and the chirping of unseen crickets.  This journey to the rumored monastery nestled in the Pyrenees, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous, months-long trek. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed determination fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, comforting presence as she navigated the treacherous currents of space, dodging asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The vastness of the cosmos, both terrifying and breathtaking, was a stark contrast to the limitations of medieval travel, yet the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of a distant goal, burned just as brightly within her heart.
