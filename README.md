
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving steppe stretching before them like a sea of brown.  Their journey to the Khan’s court was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed ravine, the weather was a capricious tormentor, and the whispers of monstrous creatures inhabiting the desolate plains kept even the bravest knight awake at night.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their endurance and loyalty, a gamble with fate itself for the promised riches and glory that lay beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the edge of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failures in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  The vastness of the cosmos offered both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a test of skill, courage, and the bonds between crewmates light years from home.
