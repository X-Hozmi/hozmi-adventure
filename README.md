
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, was her only guide to the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the far more terrifying unknown.  The journey was a relentless test of endurance, but the promise of untold riches, and perhaps even the legendary healing properties of the Sunstone, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating by the faint pulse of quasars and the ghostly echoes of ancient civilizations, she charted a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of unlocking interstellar travel, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fueled her courage and kept her ship hurtling through the inky black.
