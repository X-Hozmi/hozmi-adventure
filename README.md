
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine promising healing for her ailing brother, had led her far from her village, through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the long grass, held the potential for danger – but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been smoother than expected, though the automated systems still hummed with the strain of traversing such unimaginable distances.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying planet.  The cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking panorama of swirling colours and distant suns, both beautiful and terrifying in its immense scale.  The vastness was a challenge, but Eva, like Elara before her, was driven by a fierce hope that burned brighter than any star.
