
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a crumbling manor and a vengeful lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat in this unpredictable world.  Her journey is fraught with danger – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the promise of freedom fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rex strides the bridge of the starship *Stardust*.  The swirling nebula outside his viewport is a breathtaking canvas of cosmic colours, but the mission is far from leisurely.  His crew navigates treacherous asteroid fields and unknown gravitational currents, pushing the limits of faster-than-light travel to reach a distant galaxy teeming with unexplored planets. The risks are unimaginable –  uncharted wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the lure of discovery and the chance to chart new frontiers drives them further into the inky blackness of space.
