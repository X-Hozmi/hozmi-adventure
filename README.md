
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she bumped along the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her roughspun tunic.  Her journey to the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold secrets of forgotten magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow her whole, and the ever-present threat of illness hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a compass and a fierce heart her only guides.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unseen celestial bodies was child's play compared to the political intrigue and alien encounters she faced.  Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of breathtaking discovery and terrifying danger, a testament to the indomitable human spirit reaching for the stars.
