
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – a precious cargo destined for a monastery rumored to possess ancient agricultural knowledge.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the malice of man.  Yet, the hope of a bountiful harvest for her starving village fuels her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas. His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy. Wormholes, unpredictable solar flares, and the silent threat of alien encounters test his crew’s courage and resolve. Each jump into hyperspace is a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the infinite vastness of space. But the promise of rediscovering lost kin, and perhaps even unlocking new technologies, drives them forward across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
