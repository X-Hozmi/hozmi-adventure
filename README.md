
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a chipped map, guiding her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the forest were not to be taken lightly.  The journey was a gamble, a perilous dance with fate itself, but for her brother, Elara would face any hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  The jump to hyperspace was always a risk; unforeseen gravitational anomalies could tear the ship apart.  But the potential reward – a new home for humanity, a chance to escape the dying embers of Old Earth – fuelled her courage.  The vast, inky expanse of space was both terrifyingly beautiful and profoundly lonely; a journey demanding not only technical skill, but an unshakeable resilience of spirit.
