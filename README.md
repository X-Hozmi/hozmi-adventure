
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the dusty plains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the sense of peril.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His companions, a grizzled mercenary and a sharp-witted scholar, kept close, their eyes scanning the horizon for signs of both danger and salvation.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less arduous, requiring precise navigation through asteroid fields, constant vigilance against space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system failures in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  Her crew, a diverse team of scientists and engineers, relied on technology rather than horses, but the spirit of adventure remained the same – a brave push into the unknown.
