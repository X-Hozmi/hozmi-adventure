
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of my saddle warned of the precariousness of our journey; bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, and the biting chill threatened to claim us as surely as any blade.  Yet, the whispered legends of the mythical city of Eldoria, shimmering with gold and promising untold riches, spurred us onward, a beacon in the endless grey.  The camaraderie of my fellow travelers, forged in shared hardship and the yearning for adventure, was our only true comfort.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant colour as we leaped across the vast cosmic ocean, our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to immortality. The crew, a diverse band from across the known galaxy, navigated asteroid fields and dodged the tentacles of space krakens, their faces illuminated by the ethereal glow of the control panels.  While danger still stalked us, it was a different kind, a cosmic threat far removed from the mundane perils of the medieval world, yet equally exhilarating.
