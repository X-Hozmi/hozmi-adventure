
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her lost brother, rumored to be amongst the mercenary companies warring in the distant Duchy of Aquitaine.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger – but the thought of reunion fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, his course charted across light-years to the unexplored galaxy of Andromeda.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a counterpoint to the thrill of discovery that pulsed through his veins.  This wasn't a quest for gold or glory, but for knowledge – the potential for new life, new technologies, and the unraveling of mysteries older than time itself. The cosmos was vast, unforgiving, but the allure of the unknown propelled him forward, a solitary explorer charting the uncharted.
