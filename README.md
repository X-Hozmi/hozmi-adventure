The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies in the nearby village, a fleeting haven before the long trek across the treacherous Black Forest.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, spurred him onward, a dangerous gamble against starvation, bandits, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, inky expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was a daily challenge, the risk of system failure a constant threat, but the promise of discovery, of finding life beyond Earth, fueled her unwavering determination.  The cosmos offered a different kind of wilderness, one far more perilous yet equally captivating.
