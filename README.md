
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the stench of his own unwashed body.  He'd traversed treacherous mountain passes, skirted bandit-infested forests, and braved the wrath of sudden storms, all in pursuit of the fabled Sunstone, a relic said to hold the power of kings. Each creak of his saddle leather, each strained breath of his horse, fueled the burning hope that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey across the Andromeda galaxy, a quest for a lost colony, had been fraught with peril.  Warp core malfunctions, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies kept her crew on edge. Yet, the glimmering hope of finding life—perhaps even family—amid the breathtaking celestial tapestry spurred them onward. The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a wonder that mirrored the medieval knight's own thirst for the unknown.
