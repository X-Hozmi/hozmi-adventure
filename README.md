
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the breadth of France.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the ever-present tang of fear – fear of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests, of disease clinging to the air like a shroud, and of the unknown that lay beyond each cresting hill.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording raging rivers, bartering for meager sustenance in dusty villages.  This was no leisurely pilgrimage; this was a desperate flight, a race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars blurred into streaks of incandescent colour as we jumped, traversing lightyears in the blink of an augmented eye.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from our own sun-weary Earth.  The risks were different now – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the spirit of adventure, the insatiable human hunger for the unexplored, remained unchanged, a constant thread weaving through the centuries, binding the medieval pilgrim and the galactic explorer in a shared pursuit of the unknown.
