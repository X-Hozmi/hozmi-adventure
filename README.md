
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke clinging to the wind.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked her every step. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the legendary city, spurred her onward, a steel glint in her determined eye.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station orbiting a gas giant in a distant galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes were everyday risks.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, leaving Rexa and her crew isolated in the vast emptiness of space, reliant on their training and ingenuity.  The reward? Knowledge that could rewrite the history of interstellar travel.  But the journey itself, a breathtaking dance among the stars, was its own reward.
