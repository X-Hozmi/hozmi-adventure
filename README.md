
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his weary mount onward.  The dust of the King's Road choked him, a pale imitation of the sands he'd crossed in the Sultan's desert territories.  This journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine of healing for his ailing sister, had tested his endurance beyond belief.  Each sunrise brought fresh perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the hope in his heart, as bright as the distant sun glinting off his family's ancestral crest, fueled his onward trek.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey across the Andromeda galaxy was far removed from the medieval knight’s arduous land travel, yet equally fraught with danger.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, while the unpredictable gravitational forces of uncharted planets tested her navigational skills to their limit.  The promise of a new life, a new colony on Kepler-186f, fueled her determination, a beacon in the vast, inky blackness, a different kind of hope for a different kind of world.
