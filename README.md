
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, propelled her onward.  The promise of untold riches and exotic spices fueled her weary body and sharpened her senses, making each day's hardship a small price to pay for the adventure that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required to navigate the treacherous currents.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with dangers – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of equipment malfunction.  But the potential for discovery, for expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, outweighed any fear. The vast emptiness of space was a daunting canvas, yet the thrill of exploration was a potent fuel for her tireless spirit.
