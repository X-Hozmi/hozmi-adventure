
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and frantic scribbles, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of ancient magic and untold riches, spurred her onward, her spirit as resilient as the sun-baked earth beneath her feet.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure fuel and passage rights across the galactic trade routes.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and unimaginable wealth, but also the constant threat of pirates, rival corporations, and the unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted corners of the cosmos.
