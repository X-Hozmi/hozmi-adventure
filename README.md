
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread, a chipped flint, and a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death still haunted the land.  Her adventure was fraught with peril, but the lure of discovery burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos painting the viewport of her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond even the known galaxies.  Facing down asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravitational wells, and dodging the ever-present threat of space pirates was all part of the journey.  The vastness of space held unimaginable wonders, and immeasurable dangers, but the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets propelled her forward.
