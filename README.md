
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a bruised purple.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the constant gnawing fear of disease.  But the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape, and the unwavering faith fueling their steps made the hardships worthwhile.  Each sunrise promised a new challenge, a new vista, a step closer to their sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already spanned decades, each jump between star systems a calculated risk, a dance with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  The crew, a diverse band united by their shared thirst for exploration, faced not bandits, but cosmic radiation, malfunctioning engines, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and unlocking the universe's deepest secrets fueled their daring expedition, making the unimaginable perils a small price to pay for the grand adventure.
