
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, yet the vast, unforgiving landscape constantly reminded them of the monumental task before them. The whispers of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the distance, fueled their desperate journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through a swirling nebula, her course plotted for Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a tapestry woven from the hum of the hyperdrive, the crackle of comms, and the ever-present anxiety of navigating uncharted space.  Asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks tested both the ship and her crew’s mettle.  The promise of a new home, a planet teeming with life, pushed them relentlessly onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
