The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a far cry from the bustling marketplace of Florence I'd left behind.  My quest, to find the legendary lost city of Zerzura, pushed me onward despite the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger, and the ever-present chill of the approaching autumn.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista, a new challenge, a new hope that this day would bring me closer to my goal.

Our mission, a perilous expedition to chart unmapped star systems in search of habitable planets, held immense risk but also the promise of unparalleled discovery. The fate of humanity, perhaps even of countless other sentient beings, rested on the success of our interstellar voyage.
