
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sun, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each day brought new challenges – negotiating with suspicious villagers, foraging for food, and constantly watching for the tell-tale glint of a hostile blade.  The allure of the saint's grace, however, fueled their perseverance through the hardships of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been smoother than expected, but the ensuing hyperspace transit left her crew feeling the strain. Their mission: to survey the newly discovered planet for signs of habitable life, a journey across unimaginable distances.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of nebulae and the occasional meteor shower, held a different kind of peril –  the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel.
