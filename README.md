
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scratching at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried across kingdoms to a rumored healer. Each creak of the saddle, each rustling bush, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the unwavering gaze of the distant valley spurred her onward.  The vast, unpredictable landscape – a tapestry of forests, rivers, and unforgiving terrain – was a testament to the perils and possibilities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was less about compass and instinct, and more about navigating complex hyperspace currents and avoiding hostile nebulae.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a revolutionary energy source.  The vastness of space presented challenges vastly different from those of medieval Europe – not bandits and harsh weather, but cosmic radiation, gravity wells, and the chilling isolation of unimaginable distances.  Yet, the thrill of discovery burned just as brightly in her heart as it had in Elara's.
