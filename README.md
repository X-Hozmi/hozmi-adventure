
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones by fellow travelers.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the dry grass, holds the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  But the lure of the unknown, the chance to break free from the drudgery of her village, pushes her onward, her heart a hummingbird trapped in her chest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the Xylos Nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The swirling cosmic dust clouds are beautiful but treacherous, concealing asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of alien encounters and unpredictable spatial anomalies. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of uncovering the mysteries of Aethel's disappearance, fuels her resolve and drives her ever deeper into the inky blackness.
