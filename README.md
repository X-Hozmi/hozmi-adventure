
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the sting of hunger, the fear of bandits, and the relentless ache in her joints.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed determination spurred her on, fueled by faith and the unyielding allure of the unknown that lay ahead across the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of alien flora painted the viewport as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with danger from unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the potential encounter with unknown, perhaps hostile, civilizations.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of wonders and perils, stretched endlessly before her, the ultimate test of courage and exploration.
