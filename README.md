His journey across the treacherous Duchy of Eldoria had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

The promise of a new life on a terraformed planet, however, was the ultimate reward for her relentless pursuit of the unknown.
