
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onwards.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the shadowed forests, feuding lords demanding tolls, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty; a chance encounter with a wandering monk might offer shelter, while a wrong turn could lead to starvation in the unforgiving wilderness.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the Holy City, demanded courage, resilience, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The jump to hyperspace was always risky, and the potential for encountering unforeseen celestial phenomena or hostile alien life forms was ever-present.  But the promise of scientific advancement, the thrill of exploration across the vast cosmic ocean, fueled her determination as she navigated the treacherous paths of the galaxy.
