
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Isle of Avalon, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the whispered tales of Avalon's healing powers fueled her journey, pushing her across treacherous mountain passes and through shadowed forests, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the Xylos Nebula in the starship *Stardust*.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystals, powerful energy sources said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by shimmering nebulas and the looming threat of pirate fleets, was a different kind of wilderness.  Instead of bandits, he faced alien predators and treacherous gravitational anomalies.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled his unwavering determination, making the unimaginable journey a thrilling chase across the cosmos.
