
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains a stolen map, promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the tension.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unknown are constant companions on her perilous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe, a quest fueled by both ambition and desperation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Kepler navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic scale. His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of bridging galactic distances.  The journey is fraught with dangers – hostile alien lifeforms, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the lure of the Crystal, and the potential to rewrite the history of interstellar travel, makes the unimaginable risk worthwhile.
