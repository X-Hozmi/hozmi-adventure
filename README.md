
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his weary steed onward.  The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless rain.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, led him deeper into the wilds, through treacherous mountain passes and across rushing rivers, each step a gamble against bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His loyal squire, Thomas, lagged behind, his face etched with worry, but Reginald pressed on, fueled by a mixture of piety and stubborn determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vast distances between star systems demanded patience and precision.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the galactic arm centuries ago.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the insidious decay of time and distance itself. The weight of her crew's lives rested on her shoulders as she charted a course through the uncharted cosmic sea.
