
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under the overcast sky, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering glint of hope in his eyes pushed him further, driven by the desperate plea of his people.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the Andromeda Collective, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids, and repairing the ship's hyperdrive after a near-fatal encounter with a K'tharr warship were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a challenge far grander than any medieval knight could comprehend, yet Eva, like Gareth before her, pressed on, driven by the promise of a brighter future for her people.
