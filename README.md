
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as his small band of knights crested the hill, the spires of the distant city of Porthaven shimmering in the afternoon sun.  Their journey had been arduous; weeks spent traversing treacherous mountain passes, battling bandits, and relying on the kindness (and sometimes, the apprehension) of scattered villages for food and shelter. The whispers of a lost relic, a magical sword said to grant invincibility, propelled them onward, despite the ever-present threat of starvation, disease, and the unpredictable nature of the wilds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the rumored Xylossian artifact, a source of near-limitless energy.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the routine. The vastness of space, though beautiful, held its own perils – radiation storms, engine failures, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien species made each jump to hyperspace a gamble. Yet, the promise of discovery fueled their journey across the galaxy.
