
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic, fueled her journey. Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary mile, represented a step closer to the unknown, a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel – a test of courage and resilience against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation systems.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted celestial bodies and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Unlike the limitations of medieval travel, technology offered a degree of control, but the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of the cosmos remained constant threats, rendering every jump to hyperspace a daring leap into the unknown.
