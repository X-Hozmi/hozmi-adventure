
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each shadowed forest path represented a potential danger – bandits, starvation, disease – yet the unwavering hope in her heart propelled her forward, a tiny ember against the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her cockpit.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against dwindling resources and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifted, and the endless expanse of stars both terrified and exhilarated her, a testament to human ambition and the ceaseless pursuit of the unknown.
