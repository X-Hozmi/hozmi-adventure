
The year is 1347.  Our band of travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-caked tracks of France.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of our weary horses echoed the anxieties of our journey.  We sought the lost city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, a perilous quest that led us through feuding baronies, treacherous forests teeming with bandits, and across raging rivers swollen with spring rains.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, every nightfall the chilling uncertainty of survival.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The sleek crimson hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies, its hyperdrive humming a song of unimaginable speed.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to contain planets with life forms unlike any encountered before.  Facing the perils of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unknown alien intelligences that might dwell in those distant worlds, we pressed onward, driven by a thirst for discovery that dwarfed even the most ambitious medieval quest.
