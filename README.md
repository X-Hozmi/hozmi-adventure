
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains a fiery red.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of healing.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at faster-than-light speeds.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unseen dangers lurking in the void.  Yet, the hope of finding her people, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted corners of the cosmos, drove her across the unimaginable distances.
