
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, a worn map clutched in her hand.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored holy spring, is fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes are a constant threat, the nights are filled with the howls of wolves, and the ever-present fear of starvation hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fuels her onward, the promise of healing waters a beacon against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien life forms both wondrous and terrifying is all part of the voyage.  While the comforts of her ship are vastly superior to Elara’s rudimentary provisions, the risk of encountering hostile civilizations and navigating uncharted cosmic currents presents a different, yet equally exhilarating, kind of adventure.
