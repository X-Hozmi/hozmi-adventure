
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the muddy roads threatened to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages, and always, the gnawing fear of the unknown that whispered in the wind.  Survival depended on courage, resourcefulness, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f.  Navigation across the vast expanse of the galaxy presented a different kind of challenge – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, avoiding pirate incursions, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions light years from any rescue.   The journey tested not only the ship's capabilities, but Eva's own resolve, pushing her to the limits of human endurance in the face of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns.
