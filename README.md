
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her.  Ahead lay the whispering forests of Eldoria, legendary for both their beauty and the bandit gangs that preyed on travelers.  Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear.  She clutched the leather-bound satchel containing the King's missive, a precious cargo that promised both reward and peril in equal measure.  The thrill of the unknown, the challenge of the arduous path, and the burning hope of reaching her destination spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates were everyday occurrences, but the potential discovery of sentient life on Kepler-186f made each risk worthwhile.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, offered a different kind of adventure—one measured not in leagues but in light years, where the human spirit, in its tireless pursuit of knowledge and exploration, challenged the boundless emptiness of the cosmos.
