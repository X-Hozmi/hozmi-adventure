
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and a worn prayer book – meager provisions for a journey to the Holy Land.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the fervent belief in her quest, a pilgrimage to seek solace for a lost loved one, fueled her onward through the unforgiving landscape. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her journey wasn't measured in leagues, but in lightyears, her destination not a holy city, but Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years away.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting constant amidst the vast, echoing emptiness of space.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life – yet the thrill of exploration, of charting uncharted territories and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, burned just as fiercely in her heart as it had in Elara's.
