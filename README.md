
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the unforgiving plains, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies – it holds the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful baron and a destiny she barely understands. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, could herald a bandit, a wild beast, or worse – the baron's relentless pursuit.  Survival in this harsh landscape demands courage, cunning, and an unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders stalking the interstellar lanes.  But Eva, hardened by years of traversing the vast emptiness of space, feels the familiar thrill of adventure.  The cosmos, with its unimaginable scale and countless mysteries, offers a freedom and a challenge unlike any other.
