
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The map, a crudely drawn parchment, promised riches and glory in the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened death by exposure, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, but the lure of the East, of the unknown, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Wanderer* a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, was measured not in days or weeks, but in years of light-speed travel and calculated risks.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, alien anomalies pulsed with unnerving energy, and the vast loneliness of the cosmos pressed in on her crew.  Yet, the hope of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, propelled them forward into the uncharted darkness.
