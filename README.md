The journey from Canterbury to Rome was proving far more arduous than the whispered tales of holy pilgrimage had suggested.

Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravity wells of uncharted systems was a daily test of skill and nerve, but the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, fueled her unwavering determination.
