
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, the hushed awe of ancient, crumbling ruins, and the boisterous camaraderie of fellow travelers sharing meager rations and tall tales around crackling fires.  The destination, a fabled city whispered to hold untold riches, fuels our relentless westward push despite the gnawing hunger, the ever-present threat of disease, and the crushing weight of the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cuts through the inky blackness, its powerful engines a low hum against the backdrop of a billion shimmering suns.  Our journey spans galaxies, each jump a leap of faith into the void, a gamble against malfunctioning hyperdrives and uncharted nebulae.  The thrill is not of bandits or disease, but of encountering alien civilizations, both benevolent and hostile,  discovering new planets, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration – a constant gamble for survival and discovery light years from home.
