
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Shrine of Saint Jude, had already tested their mettle.  Bandits had waylaid them in the Black Forest, forcing a desperate flight through moonlit glades.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the rhythmic clop of hooves on cobblestone streets, the hushed whispers of ancient monasteries, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the sacred shrine, the whispered promises of healing and salvation, pushed them relentlessly towards their unknown destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with undiscovered alien life.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless pursuit of a rival corporation's mercenary fleet, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's cutting-edge technology.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the constant threat of unforeseen dangers made each jump between star systems a gamble, a breathtaking adventure in the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
