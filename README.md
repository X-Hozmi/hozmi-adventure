
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the canyons, the desert thirsted for her blood, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept her constantly vigilant.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fuelled by the whispered promises of untold riches and the chance to prove her family's legacy.  The journey itself, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, became as valuable as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a perilous task requiring navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vast, inky canvas of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a stark contrast to the sterile environment of her ship.  The interstellar journey, a testament to human ingenuity and courage, was a constant test of skill and resilience, far removed from the dusty trails of her medieval predecessors but sharing the same spirit of intrepid exploration.
