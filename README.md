The dusty track snaked through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous – towering mountains loomed, their snow-capped peaks a stark contrast to the arid plains below.

The potential rewards – the discovery of new life, untold riches, and the expansion of humanity's reach – were worth the unimaginable risks of interstellar travel.
