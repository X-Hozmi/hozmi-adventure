
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom – and the key to her family's survival.  Bandit raids were commonplace, and the whispers of a dragon guarding a mountain pass added a thrilling, terrifying edge to her journey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  The vast unknown lay ahead, a tapestry woven with peril and the promise of freedom.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of the ancient Proxima Centauri civilization.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet the cosmic expanse held its own brand of danger – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, however, was a constant reward, a breathtaking canvas of nebulas and distant galaxies, a stark contrast to the dusty medieval plains, yet equally compelling in its promise of discovery and adventure.
