Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a worn map, a few silver coins, and a letter promising sanctuary in the distant lands of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, disease, or the simple unforgiving nature of the road.  Yet, the glint of adventure in her eyes outweighed any fear.  This journey, though fraught with peril, held the key to her future.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic radiation and unpredictable gravitational fields, each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  The crew, a motley mix of seasoned explorers and ambitious rookies, faced the challenges with a mixture of apprehension and exhilaration.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly unknown, held the promise of discovery – and perhaps, oblivion.
