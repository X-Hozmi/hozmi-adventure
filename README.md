
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him on, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.  He carried with him not only a map, but also the unwavering belief in his destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and facing the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all part of the routine. Yet, the vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos, the sheer scale of her journey, filled her with a sense of wonder that matched the risk. The search for the lost colony was a challenge, but the true adventure lay in the exploration of the universe itself, in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and experience.
