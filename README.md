
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the rough-spun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she urges her weary horse onward.  The midday sun beats down on the parched landscape, the only sounds the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead. Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, forging her into a survivor in this brutal, beautiful world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the Xylos Nebula in the starship *Stardust*.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is a constant companion, a reassuring thrum against the vast, inky blackness peppered with glittering constellations.  His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey demanding precise calculations and nerve-shredding jumps through wormholes.  The dangers are different now – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms – but the thrill of exploration, the siren call of the unknown, remains just as powerful a draw.
