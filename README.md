
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she urged her mare onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the relentless chirping of cicadas.  Ahead, the sun beat down on the endless expanse of the Rhône valley, its shimmering heat blurring the distant peaks of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the constant gnawing fear of disease or starvation.  But with every sunrise, Elara felt the thrill of her quest – to reach the fabled city of Constantinople and deliver the sacred relic entrusted to her care.  The road was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown kept her pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx’s starship, *The Wanderer*, cut a swathe through the nebula known as the Serpent's Eye.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey was fraught with different perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate raiders. Yet, unlike the medieval treks of old, Jaxx possessed technology that bent the very fabric of space-time, shrinking the vast distances between star systems into manageable leaps.  The thrill, however, remained constant: the relentless drive to explore the unknown, to push the boundaries of human knowledge and to face whatever wonders – or horrors – lay beyond the reach of known galaxies.
