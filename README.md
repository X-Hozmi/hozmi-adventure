Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already tested their endurance – weeks spent traversing muddy tracks, dodging bandits, and sleeping under a sky thick with stars.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the whispered legends of the holy city fueled their weary steps.

Her crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists, geologists, and engineers, faced dangers far beyond bandits and rivers – hostile alien lifeforms, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light years from any rescue.  Their adventure was a carefully calculated risk, a leap into the vast, unknown expanse of the galaxy.
