
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for banditry or worse – a threat as real as the gnawing hunger in his belly.  The journey was perilous, a tapestry woven with sun-baked days, freezing nights, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her and her crew as they plunged deeper into the cosmic unknown.
