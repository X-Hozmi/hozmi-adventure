
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke clinging to the chill air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers – and the potential rewards – of her perilous adventure. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the wild itself tested her resilience with every passing league.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  His mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperately overpopulated Earth.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, Rexx faced a different kind of peril – the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of technological failure lightyears from any help.  The adventure, however, was equally breathtaking, a voyage into the infinite.
