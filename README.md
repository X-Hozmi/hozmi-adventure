
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this pilgrimage, but the whispered promise of a life free from the plague’s grip fueled her weary steps. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and unexpected discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the journey to the Kepler-186f system remained a harrowing test of endurance and navigational skill.  The unpredictable warp currents, the threat of pirate raiders, and the ever-present risk of system failures all contributed to the constant tension. But the lure of a new world, a chance to chart unmapped territories and discover new life, far outweighed the danger.
