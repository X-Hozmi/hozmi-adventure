
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône valley, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her roughspun tunic.  Her quest, to reach the legendary monastery of Saint-Gilles and deliver a vital message, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-watchful eyes of strangers. Yet, the fire of her purpose burned bright, fueling her onward, a tiny flicker of defiance against the vast and unpredictable medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' across the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and unimaginable cosmic phenomena.  Her mission: to chart a previously unexplored sector of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take years, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, possibly hostile, alien civilizations.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of charting new worlds and expanding human understanding, outweighed the risks, propelling her and her crew further into the unknown.
