His quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were constant companions on his arduous journey, but the lure of the unknown spurred him on, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience.
