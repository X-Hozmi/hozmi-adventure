
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's weary band crested the hill, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before them.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  The journey had been brutal – bandits, treacherous passes, and gnawing hunger their constant companions.  But the glint of hope, however faint, fueled their aching limbs and spurred them onward, each step a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present shadow of death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the tentacles of spacefaring leviathans, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval knights.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying unknowns and the fragile promise of rediscovering a lost civilization, a quest as perilous and ultimately as rewarding as any undertaken in the age of chivalry.
