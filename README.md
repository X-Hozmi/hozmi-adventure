
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees looming like ancient, sleeping giants.  Her worn map, a testament to weeks spent traversing treacherous mountain trails and sun-baked plains, promised a shortcut to the fabled city of Zaragoza.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for both wonder – a hidden spring, a glimpse of a rare bird – and peril – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a quest for riches and knowledge.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula, its hyperdrive a hum against the cosmic silence.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was routine, yet the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos constantly filled Ryla with a humbling awe.  The journey was a gamble, a calculated risk against unimaginable distances and the potential dangers of uncharted space, but the promise of unlocking interstellar travel spurred her onward.
