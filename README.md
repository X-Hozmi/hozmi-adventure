
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his weary steed onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Jude, had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and into the shadow of foreboding forests.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge –  negotiating with suspicious villagers, fording raging rivers, or evading the clutches of a desperate warlord.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of divine intervention, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled his relentless pace.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, a symphony of controlled chaos, as they navigated asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational anomalies.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, the vast distances a constant reminder of their isolation.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding survivors, and the sheer audacity of interstellar travel propelled them forward, a tiny ship against the infinite expanse of space.
