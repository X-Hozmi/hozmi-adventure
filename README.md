
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery hidden deep within the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the key to healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery, from bandits lurking in shadowed forests to the unpredictable kindness of strangers offering meager shelter. The journey was as much about surviving the harsh realities of the land as it was about reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship *Stardust* pierced the inky black of hyperspace, emerging into the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across this vibrant, uncharted region of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Rexa and her crew faced alien encounters both wondrous and terrifying.  The vastness of space held a different kind of hardship than Elara's journey, a loneliness tempered only by the camaraderie of her crew and the burning hope of finding New Eden.
