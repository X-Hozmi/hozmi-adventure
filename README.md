
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the ravaged landscape of France was proving far more arduous than anticipated.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the meager supplies dwindling with each passing day, and the endless, dusty plains seemed to stretch to the very edge of the world.  Yet, the whispered promise of a lost city, rich in ancient magic and untold treasures, fueled his relentless pursuit, a beacon against the encroaching despair of the endless road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast expanse of the cosmos.  The jump to Xylos was risky, the wormhole unstable and prone to temporal distortions. But the potential rewards – a rare element vital to her people's survival – outweighed the peril. The hum of the engines, the distant whisper of cosmic radiation, and the breathtaking view of swirling galaxies became her constant companions as she pushed the boundaries of human exploration, a solitary voyager charting a course through the uncharted territories of the universe.
