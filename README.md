Ahead lay the Whispering Mountains, a treacherous path rumored to hold both unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable dangers.  Bandits, mythical beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked the unwary traveler, but the lure of the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to be paved with gold and guarded by ancient magic, spurred him onward.
