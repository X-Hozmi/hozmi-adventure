
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the scorching desert threatened to claim him before he ever reached the oasis. Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of legend, spurred him ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship scattered across a dozen star systems.  Navigation relied on ancient, unreliable star charts and a gut feeling honed by years of interstellar travel.  Hyperdrive failures, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation made each jump a gamble.  But the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, fueled her unwavering determination.
