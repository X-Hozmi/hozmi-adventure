
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate race against a creeping plague.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, with each step, the flickering hope of sanctuary and salvation spurred them forward, their medieval world a tapestry of peril and unexpected kindness from the few souls they encountered.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. The journey itself was a breathtaking spectacle – navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and enduring weeks of hyperspace transit. But the true adventure lay in the unknown:  the ancient secrets held within the derelict station, and the unpredictable dangers of a planet teeming with alien life forms, both beautiful and potentially deadly.
