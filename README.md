
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it holds the weight of her family's hopes, a desperate journey to escape the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, carries the thrill and terror of the unknown.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous pilgrimage across a land both beautiful and brutally indifferent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula swirling with colours unseen on Earth. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and isolating; the hum of the hyperdrive a counterpoint to the silent, star-strewn expanse outside.  The journey is fraught with peril - rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. Yet, the promise of discovery and a new beginning fuels her every decision, driving her onward across the cosmic ocean.
