
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his mule through the treacherous Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the distant city of Prague, bearing a vital message for the Emperor.  Robbers, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are his constant companions. Yet, the glint of adventure in his eyes burns brighter than any campfire, fuelled by the promise of reward and the allure of the unknown that lies beyond each bend in the path. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling leaf, each distant wolf howl – all are part of the tapestry of his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Cygnus X-1, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Her mission: to reach the Kepler-186f system and establish first contact with a potentially sentient species.  The dangers are different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the thrill remains the same. The cosmos stretches before her, a boundless expanse of mystery and wonder, promising untold discoveries and challenges only matched by the boundless courage of those who dare to explore its depths.
