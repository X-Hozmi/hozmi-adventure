
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, transforming every hardship into a step closer to their fantastical goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel had its own brand of peril; spatial distortions, pirate attacks, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms.  But the promise of discovering new civilizations, charting previously unseen galaxies, and expanding human knowledge fueled her ambition, making the vast, indifferent expanse of space a thrilling playground for her and her intrepid crew.
