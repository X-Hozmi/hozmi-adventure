
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – precious varieties collected from far-flung monasteries, a pilgrimage undertaken for the survival of her village.  Each winding trail, each river crossing, each encounter with wary villagers and opportunistic bandits, represents a gamble in this desperate quest.  The allure of the unknown, however, far outweighs the peril; the hope of a bountiful harvest fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through a nebula, vibrant colours swirling around her vessel like cosmic paint.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets capable of sustaining human life.  The vastness of space, a humbling and awe-inspiring canvas, presents challenges unlike any faced by Elara.  Navigation through asteroid fields, communication delays across light-years, and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena test her skill and courage on a scale that transcends mere earthly adventure.
