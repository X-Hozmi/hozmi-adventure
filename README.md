
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at the dangers lurking – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the wind whispering tales of faraway lands, fueled her onward.  This journey, fraught with peril, was a testament to the human spirit's indomitable will to survive and seek fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity’s expanding colonies.  The vastness of space held a different kind of danger – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life forms.  But the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding new worlds, propelled her crew forward, their hearts filled with a sense of adventure as profound as any medieval traveler's.
