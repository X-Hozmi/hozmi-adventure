The journey across the rugged Breton countryside was brutal; mud clung to his boots, relentless rain soaked him to the bone, and the ever-present threat of bandits kept his hand close to the pommel of his sword.  Yet, the whispered promise of a lost city, brimming with forgotten knowledge and untold riches, spurred him on. Each creak of the saddle, each flash of lightning, fueled the adventure, a desperate gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the passage of time.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril; rogue asteroids threatened to puncture the ship's hull, solar flares threatened to fry the navigation systems, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space pressed upon the crew.  But the allure of unlocking the secrets of the universe, of charting a course to uncharted galaxies, burned brighter than any star in the vast expanse.
