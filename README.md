
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to her homespun tunic.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers demanded careful crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new brush with fate.  Yet, the promise of the fabled Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins of Eldoria, fueled her relentless onward push.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards, but the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula presented a unique and terrifying challenge.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space, both beautiful and dangerous, held the key to the galaxy's future – and Comet's destiny.
