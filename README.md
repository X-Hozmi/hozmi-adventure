
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and the grime of a thousand leagues, trudged onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked earth, the air thick with the scent of sunbaked clay and woodsmoke. Our destination: the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to lie at the heart of the vast Sahara.  Each sunrise brought the peril of bandits, shifting sands, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred us onward, our resolve tested by every dune and every hardship.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, sliced through the inky blackness, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of system failures tested the crew’s skill and courage. But the hope of discovering life beyond our solar system, of expanding humanity’s reach into the grand tapestry of the cosmos, fueled their every action.
