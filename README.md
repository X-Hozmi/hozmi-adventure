
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a test of endurance and cunning, pushing him further into the heart of the unknown, driven by a desperate hope and the whispered promise of untold riches.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet swallowed by a nebula decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, Eva relied on her wits, her advanced technology, and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The search was perilous, but the potential discovery of a lost civilization outweighed any risk.
