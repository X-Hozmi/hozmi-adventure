
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rough cobblestones jarring his bones.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  He rode through sun-drenched vineyards and shadowed forests, his loyal squire, Thomas, a constant shadow at his side.  Each day brought new perils – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the promise of Eldoria fueled his weary limbs.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a perilous search for the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging hostile K'tharr cruisers, Eva relied on her seasoned crew and the ship’s experimental warp drive. The vast emptiness of space pressed in, a constant reminder of the immense distances and unimaginable dangers that stood between her and her goal, but the hope of finding survivors, even a single trace of the lost colony, kept her engine roaring towards the unknown.
