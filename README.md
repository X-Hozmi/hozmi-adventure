
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and a mule laden with meager supplies, navigated the treacherous, rutted roads of medieval England.  Their quest: to reach the rumored monastery in the Scottish Highlands, said to hold the lost manuscript of  Merlin. Bandit ambushes, flooded river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their courage and resilience. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the satisfaction of having pushed further into the unknown, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and the thrill of the undiscovered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted space demanded precision and bravery. The vastness of the cosmos offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble, and the eventual discovery a triumph of human ingenuity and courage.
