Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled metropolis said to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the perils he faced, but the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of glory, spurred him on through the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience on this perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the nebula decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of celestial bodies was a daily routine, the hum of the ship's engines a constant companion against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  The fate of a forgotten civilization rested on her shoulders, a burden she carried with the steely resolve of a seasoned explorer venturing into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
