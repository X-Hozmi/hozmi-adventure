
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and hastily scribbled notes, guided her toward the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely inconveniences in her quest for glory and the legendary Eldorian jewels.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the fabled  Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Asteroids the size of moons, pirate fleets lurking in the shadows of gas giants, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were the daily hazards of her intergalactic voyage. The rewards, however, promised to rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.
