
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the sparse brush, heightened the tension.  Robbers, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant threats, but the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the desert of their ambition, spurred them relentlessly forward.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the changing hues of the sky and the ever-present danger.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, star-dusted canvas outside her viewport held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of system malfunctions tested her skill and the ship's resilience.  But the hope of discovering new life, of expanding humanity's reach beyond the cradle of Earth, fueled her journey, propelling her across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
