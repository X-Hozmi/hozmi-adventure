
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's decree, a summons to a faraway court, had thrust him onto this perilous journey.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease formed a tapestry of hardship.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, each night a desperate hope for shelter and safety.  His pack, heavy with supplies and the King's urgent message, felt heavier with every mile. This was not a quest for glory, but a brutal slog across a land both beautiful and unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace had been smooth, but the weeks-long journey through the void held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life.  Each star system was a potential haven or a deadly trap, demanding precise navigation and unwavering courage.  The weight of countless lives rested on her shoulders, a far cry from the solitary burdens of medieval travel, but equally demanding in its own way.
