
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll detailing a rumored lost monastery, said to contain ancient knowledge. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but small price to pay for the chance to uncover its secrets. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a new hope for the legendary sanctuary that beckoned her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system and search for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers weren't.  Unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms kept her crew on edge. Yet, the vast, shimmering expanse of space, with its infinite possibilities, fueled her adventurous spirit and drove her relentlessly towards the unknown.
