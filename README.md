
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from the bustling port of Marseilles to the fabled monastery of Saint-Jacques was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a thrill in facing the unknown, and the quiet satisfaction of a day's journey completed, inching closer to her destination.  The whispers of ancient magic and the promise of healing spurred her onward, a testament to the enduring allure of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst the cosmic grandeur.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the fringes of known space.  The dangers were less tangible than bandits and disease, more insidious – rogue asteroids, hostile alien species, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the potential reward – the rediscovery of a lost civilization – fueled her insatiable thirst for exploration, making every risk worthwhile.
