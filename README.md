
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  His journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience, pushing him closer to the legendary city, and a destiny yet unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at the speed of light.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll, a hostile insectoid race, tested her skills and the ship's resilience to the limit. The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable discoveries, but also the chilling possibility of never returning to the familiar warmth of Sol.
