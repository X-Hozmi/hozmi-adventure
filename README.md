
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, urged his mule onward. The rough track, barely a path in places, wound through the unforgiving Pyrenees mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, seeking a cure for his ailing sister, a journey that felt as vast and impossible as the starry sky above.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Elara and her crew faced perils no medieval traveler could comprehend. The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and dark voids, was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly unforgiving, demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering belief in their mission.
