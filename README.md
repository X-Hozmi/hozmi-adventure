
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Kaelan's saddle as he guides his destrier across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whisper of Zerzura’s healing waters drives him onward, fueled by hope and a yearning for a world beyond the ravaged landscape he knows.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity facing resource depletion.  Faster-than-light travel is perilous, wormholes unpredictable, and alien encounters, though rare, carry the potential for both wonder and annihilation.  But Elara, haunted by the ghosts of a dying Earth, embraces the vast unknown, driven by the hope of finding a new dawn amongst the stars.
