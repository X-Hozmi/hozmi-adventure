
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a tyrannical lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of her journey, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape itself.  Reaching her destination, the fabled city of  Aethelburg, felt as distant as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony for humanity.  Unlike the medieval journeys of her ancestors, Eva's voyage involved navigating asteroid fields, encountering bizarre alien lifeforms, and battling the constant threat of system malfunctions.  The vast expanse of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, offered a different kind of wilderness to conquer, demanding precision, courage, and an unwavering belief in the future of humanity among the stars.
