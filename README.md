
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a test of endurance and courage against the vast, unpredictable landscape of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders and hidden perils, was a far cry from medieval mountains, yet the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding rogue space debris, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena,  Eva's voyage was a relentless push against the limits of human exploration.
