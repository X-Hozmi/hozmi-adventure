
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the hope of healing fueled her onward, transforming the harsh realities of medieval travel into a thrilling, perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of warp travel.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held a different kind of hardship than Elara's journey, but the spirit of adventure, the yearning for the unknown, burned just as brightly in Eva’s heart.
