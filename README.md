
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, spurred his mount onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled behind them, a brown tide swallowed by the vast, undulating plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, kept his weary legs moving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a tapestry of shimmering stars and silent voids.  Wormhole jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the ship's ancient engines strained under the relentless demands of hyperspace.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled her determination, making the dangers worthwhile.
