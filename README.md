
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with scorching heat, torrential downpours, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of their packhorses, each whispered prayer, punctuated the vast silence of the landscape.  Rumors of mythical beasts and lost cities fueled their weary steps, a potent cocktail of fear and hope that kept them pressing onward, their eyes fixed on a distant horizon promising salvation, or perhaps, a far more perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a breathtaking plunge into the unknown where the fabric of spacetime itself threatened to unravel.  Yet, for Eva, the vast distances between worlds were nothing compared to the thrill of discovery, the insatiable hunger to push the boundaries of human exploration and unravel the universe's most ancient secrets.
