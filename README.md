
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel, containing little more than dried bread and a chipped map, felt heavy with the weight of her quest.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous rivers snaked across her path, and the whispers of a mythical city, lost to time, fuelled her relentless journey. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the allure of the unknown kept her pushing forward, her spirit as strong as the steel of her sword.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the Xylos nebula, the shimmering colours of distant galaxies painting her cockpit window.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hummed with the power of a thousand suns as she charted a course for the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes were constant threats. But Rexa, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for discovery, pressed onward, driven by the hope of finding new life, new civilizations, and rewriting the history of interstellar travel.
