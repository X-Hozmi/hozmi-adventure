
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary carried across a treacherous landscape.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions on this pilgrimage towards the rumored haven of the southern coast.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of perilous adventure, a gamble against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a course to the unmapped Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia for slower vessels but within reach of her experimental Alcubierre drive.  The vast, inky blackness was both terrifying and exhilarating, the countless stars a shimmering tapestry of untold possibilities and unknown dangers.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on the integrity of her ship and the accuracy of her calculations, a true odyssey amongst the stars.
