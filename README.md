
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the sense of adventure, of the unknown dangers lurking beyond the next ridge.  Her quest – to find the legendary healer rumored to reside in a hidden monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees Mountains – was a gamble, but the desperate need to save her ailing brother fueled her onward.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of illness were small prices to pay for hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant cosmic dust painting breathtaking, alien landscapes across his viewport. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey fraught with perils far exceeding any medieval knight's.  Warp storms threatened to tear his ship apart, pirate fleets lurked in the shadows of uncharted systems, and the alien flora and fauna of unexplored planets posed a constant threat. But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and uncovering lost history, was a siren's call he couldn't resist.
