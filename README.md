
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains, a sanctuary rumored to hold ancient healing secrets.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the whispered legends of the monastery fueled her onward, a flicker of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the vibrant hues shifted and danced around her ship.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was a gamble, a desperate mission to find a new home for her people, ravaged by a devastating solar flare.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of undiscovered planets, Ryla relied on instinct and cutting-edge technology to reach their destination, a potential haven light-years away, a beacon in the infinite darkness.
