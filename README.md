
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains presented treacherous crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, a new encounter with the harsh beauty of the medieval world, a world where the simplest journey felt like a grand adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents was commonplace.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, offered a different kind of danger, a lonely expanse where even the smallest malfunction could mean certain death.  Yet, the promise of discovery spurred her onward, a testament to humanity’s relentless thirst for the unknown.
