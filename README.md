
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost alchemists.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, laden with meager supplies and a battered map, marked another mile swallowed by the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the breadth of the Holy Roman Empire.  The promise of glory and untold riches, however, fueled his relentless push towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and enduring the mind-numbing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the routine.  The mission, though fraught with danger, offered a chance to uncover the mysteries of life beyond Earth and secure humanity's future amongst the stars. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, also held an undercurrent of terrifying unknown, making every jump through hyperspace a gamble with fate.
