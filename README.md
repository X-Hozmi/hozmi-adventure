
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, spurred his destrier onward, the biting wind whipping at his worn surcoat.  Their journey across the treacherous, snow-dusted Alps was a perilous one, fraught with the dangers of bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled his relentless drive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Reginald's journey, hers was technologically advanced, yet the inherent risk—the vastness of the unknown—remained a thrilling, terrifying constant.
