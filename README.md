
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown fueled his weary steps, a relentless pull toward the horizon promising both glory and death in equal measure. The journey was his lifeblood, each hardship strengthening his resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system malfunctions.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril than Thomas's medieval world, a lonely expanse demanding courage, precision, and unwavering technological prowess.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the vastness of the unknown, echoed the same adventurous spirit that had driven countless explorers before her, across time and space.
