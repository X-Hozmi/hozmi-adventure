
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's steed as he urged the weary animal onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, or worse.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, punctuated by fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  Unlike Sir Gareth, Eva faced a different kind of hardship – the loneliness of deep space, the relentless hum of the ship's engines, and the knowledge that a single malfunction could mean oblivion in the cold, indifferent vastness of the cosmos.
