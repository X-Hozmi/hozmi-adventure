
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's band of knights crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Rhône Valley stretching before them. Their quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of a heretical sect rumored to dwell in the shadowed Pyrenees.  Ahead lay weeks of perilous travel – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease, all obstacles to their sacred mission.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the glint of steel and the unwavering loyalty of their fellowship fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, the stars were their guide.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the risks of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the unknown dangers of uncharted space, tested their courage and resolve.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, pushed them onward, a beacon in the cosmic dark.
