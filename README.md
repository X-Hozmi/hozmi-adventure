
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles strewn across his path.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear that his journey would end not in glory, but in an unmarked grave beneath the unforgiving sky.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril from unstable wormholes and pirate fleets.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes.   With her crew, she navigated celestial storms and alien encounters, the weight of galactic exploration resting on her shoulders as she pushed the boundaries of human knowledge and dared to traverse the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
