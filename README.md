
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a victory against the relentless downpour.  Ahead, the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a daunting but necessary passage on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the whispered rumors of Zerzura’s untold riches and magical artifacts fueled my weary body and resolute spirit. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to my stubborn endurance.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby.  Across the shimmering expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy, countless nebulae painted breathtaking tapestries across the void. My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The dangers were different now—void storms that threatened to tear the ship apart, hostile alien species lurking in unexplored systems, and the ever-present threat of technological failure.  Yet, the lure of discovery, of unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos, propelled me forward, each jump to warp speed a leap of faith into the unknown.
