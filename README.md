
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of healing fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Rourke piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of his starship.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a revolutionary energy source.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers were child's play compared to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  The loneliness was the true enemy, a creeping void that threatened to swallow even the bravest soul.  But the promise of discovery, and the potential to reshape the galaxy, kept his engines roaring.
