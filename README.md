
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their mission: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death sweeping across Europe.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present fear of the plague itself.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril and hope, a constant test of endurance and loyalty against the unforgiving backdrop of a medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, were on a decades-long mission to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, the alien landscapes both beautiful and terrifying, and the constant threat of pirate raids a chilling reality.  Their adventure was one of scientific discovery, thrilling exploration, and the unyielding pursuit of knowledge across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
