
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless; each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of the Crusade, the promise of glory and salvation, pushed him relentlessly forward, each aching muscle fueled by a burning faith and unwavering determination.  He dreamt not of comfort, but of Jerusalem.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant – a seemingly simple task, overshadowed by the ever-present danger of pirate attacks and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel itself.  The vastness of the cosmos, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, held both incredible beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Yet, Eva, hardened by years of intergalactic exploration, felt the familiar thrill of adventure course through her veins as she navigated the perilous journey, her destiny written among the stars.
