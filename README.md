The dusty track, barely a path across the unforgiving French countryside, snaked towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges facing him and his small band.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new peril, each sunset the fragile hope of reaching their elusive goal – a legendary city said to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the chilling beauty of cosmic phenomena, held dangers far exceeding any earthly threat.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational forces, and the ever-present risk of engine failure were just a few of the hurdles in her path.  Yet, the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, fueled her courage and propelled her ever onward.
