
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, spurred their mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in impoverished villages. Yet, the unwavering faith and the shared camaraderie forged a bond stronger than any obstacle.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps were risky, each a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies and pirate attacks.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known systems, faced alien landscapes, hostile wildlife, and the constant pressure of dwindling supplies. The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to human ambition and the enduring allure of the unknown.
