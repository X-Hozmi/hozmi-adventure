
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Fiacre, had taken him far from his village, through feuding baronies and across treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen by relentless rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the sacred site, and the thrill of the unknown, propelled him relentlessly forward, transforming every hardship into a badge of honour earned on his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and contending with unpredictable warp storms was all in a day's work, but this mission carried a unique weight –  the future of her people hung in the balance.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both wonder and peril, a testament to the unyielding human spirit that dared to reach for the stars.
