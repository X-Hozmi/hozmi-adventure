
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castilla, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, rogue knights, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, a quest fuelled by whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic.  The road was long, the challenges immense, but the allure of the unknown propelled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and locate potential habitable planets for colonisation.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.  Alien encounters, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the constant hum of the ship’s engines were the realities of her interstellar voyage, a journey far removed from medieval trails but no less perilous or exciting.
