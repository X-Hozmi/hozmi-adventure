
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, patched and faded, offers little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty of her journey.  Rumors of a lost monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets, drive her onward, past crumbling castles and whispering forests, each step a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the plague.  The journey is arduous, but the promise of discovery fuels her weary spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, a beacon of hope in the vast, lonely expanse of space.  The journey is fraught with peril – asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the allure of new worlds, new life, and untold discoveries propels him forward, a lone explorer charting the unmapped territories of the galaxy.
