
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought the promise of a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing fear that Zerzura was only a myth, a cruel phantom in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry of interstellar wonders and terrifying unknowns – navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged warp drives, and enduring the psychological strain of prolonged isolation.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of building a new future among the stars, propelled her and her crew onwards, through the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
