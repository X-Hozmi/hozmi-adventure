
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains did little to deter her; she sought the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the key to healing her ailing brother. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at both peril and the promise of discovery, turning her journey into a desperate race against time and the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble on untested coordinates leading to a rumored planet rich in Xylium, a rare element vital for sustaining life beyond Earth's dying sun.  With each hyperspace jump, the vastness of the universe pressed in, a breathtaking yet terrifying reminder of the isolation and incredible potential that lay ahead in the endless expanse of space.
