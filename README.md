
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her – a constant reminder of the precariousness of her journey across the continent, a pilgrimage fueled by hope and a desperate search for a rumored lost city.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, his starship shuddering as it jumped across the void between galaxies. The swirling nebulae outside his cockpit window, a canvas of vibrant purples and emerald greens, offered a breathtaking spectacle, a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation.  His mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of uncharted space, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies.  The vastness of the cosmos both terrified and exhilarated him.
