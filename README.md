
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, a tattered map clutched in his gloved hand.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the parched undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or mythical beast – the thrill of the unknown fueling his every stride across the vast, untamed continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace were but small challenges in her grand voyage of exploration and colonization.  The cosmos, a canvas of infinite possibility and terrifying unknowns, offered a different kind of adventure, one measured not in leagues but in light-years, where the rewards were not gold and jewels but the very survival and expansion of humanity.
