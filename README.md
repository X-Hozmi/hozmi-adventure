
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the canyons,  storms threatened to engulf her, and the relentless sun beat down, testing the limits of her endurance.  Each day brought new challenges, forcing her to rely on her wits and courage to survive the treacherous path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for hyperspace navigation. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became routine. The vast emptiness of space held its own unique dangers, but the promise of finding the lost colonists, and perhaps uncovering new worlds and civilizations, fueled her intrepid spirit.
