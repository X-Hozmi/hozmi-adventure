
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, a mere thread through the dense Ardennes forest, wound ever deeper, promising both peril and reward.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled his quest. Each rustle of leaves, each shadow in the deepening woods, held the potential for bandit ambush, monstrous beast, or unexpected wonder. The journey was arduous, fraught with danger, yet the lure of the unknown spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars and the hum of her ship's engines, was a different kind of wilderness than the forests of old.  Yet the thrill of discovery, the potential for both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, remained a constant companion, mirroring the spirit of adventure that had driven explorers for millennia.
