
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, pressed onward through the mud-choked roads of France.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their quest, to reach the fabled city of Alexandria rumored to hold ancient knowledge, pushed them relentlessly forward, each hardship forging a stronger bond between them. The creak of their pack animals and the rhythmic thud of their boots against the earth marked their slow but determined progress across a vast and unpredictable land.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek starship capable of warping between galaxies.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, outwitting space pirates, and repairing vital systems in the inky blackness between worlds were mere inconveniences in their pursuit of the lost colonists.  The vast emptiness of space was a constant companion, a humbling reminder of their vulnerability, yet the promise of discovery and the hope of reunion fueled their relentless journey across the infinite expanse.
