
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the chill wind whipping at my cloak as I journeyed east.  Each sunrise revealed a new tapestry of rolling hills, dense forests whispering secrets only the wind could understand, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages mingled with the sharp tang of pine and damp earth, a constant companion on this arduous pilgrimage across the breadth of the kingdom, a quest for a mythical healing herb said to grow only in the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  My pack, heavy with supplies and hope, felt lighter with each mile conquered.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, a low thrum that vibrated through my bones as we leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  The star-strewn canvas of space, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns, shifted and changed with each jump, a mesmerizing dance of light years condensed into moments.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The risk was immense, the unknown vast, but the potential reward – a future free from the limitations of space and time – made the perilous journey worthwhile.
