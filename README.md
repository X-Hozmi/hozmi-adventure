
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward, the midday sun beating down on our dust-choked trail.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting meat from a distant village offered a tempting respite, but our quest demanded we press on, across the treacherous Black Mire and into the shadow of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, where the legendary Sunstone was said to be hidden.  Each creak of our pack animals, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The Althea, our generation starship, hummed a quiet song as it pierced the void between galaxies.  Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to harbor a planet teeming with life unlike anything humanity had ever encountered.  The vast, inky blackness held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns.  A single malfunction could mean the difference between discovery and oblivion, a testament to the relentless, thrilling danger inherent in pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
