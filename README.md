
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snaked across the sun-baked plains of France.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as we pressed onward, our goal the fabled city of Damascus.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the ever-present hunger gnawing at our bellies, and the fear of the unknown – a vast, untamed wilderness stretching before us like a monstrous, sleeping beast.  Yet, the lure of the East, of exotic spices and untold riches, spurred us forward, each weary step an act of courage against the unforgiving landscape and the perils of the era.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  The sleek obsidian hull of the *Starseeker* sliced through the inky blackness of space, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million shimmering suns.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was long, measured in months of near-light speed travel, a test of both our technology and our endurance.  But the promise of discovery, of finding life beyond our own pale blue dot, fueled us, making the vast emptiness of space a thrilling, if daunting, adventure.
