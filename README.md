
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pushed onward.  His journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, the landscape a blur of rolling hills and dark forests.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or disease, but the whispered tales of Jerusalem's sacred city spurred him on.  The camaraderie of fellow pilgrims, forged in shared hardship, was his only solace against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Elara piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Galaxies spun like cosmic dust motes outside her viewport, each a potential destination, a new adventure.  The thrill of charting unexplored systems, the risk of encountering unknown alien life, the sheer immensity of space – these were the dangers and rewards of her interstellar voyage.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a journey fueled by hope and the unyielding human spirit of exploration.
