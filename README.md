
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Ys, and the glory that awaited its discoverer, propelled him forward, a lone knight against a backdrop of sprawling wilderness and ancient secrets.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump across hyperspace brought them closer to the unknown, facing dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval knights – rogue asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of engine failure in the unforgiving expanse of deep space. Yet, the promise of discovery and the advancement of humankind drove her crew onward, a tiny vessel against the immensity of the cosmos.
