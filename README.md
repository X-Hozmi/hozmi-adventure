
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing herbs.  Each creaking step brought her closer to the unknown, a treacherous journey filled with the constant threat of bandits, unforgiving weather, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the wild.  Yet, the unwavering light of her purpose propelled her forward, turning hardship into grit and uncertainty into a thrilling chase against time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light-years of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading hostile pirate fleets was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the loneliness of interstellar travel, the crushing weight of responsibility for her crew, and the constant hum of anticipation for the unknown wonders and dangers that awaited them beyond the veil of stars.
