
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a treacherous barrier between her and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors whisper of monstrous beasts and cunning bandits, but the lure of Zerzura's rumored healing spring, a desperate hope for her ailing brother, spurs her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each gust of wind across the vast landscape, is a pulse of the adventure, a testament to the courage it takes to chase a whisper of hope across a continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The swirling colours of nebulas and the cold, distant gleam of uncharted planets are her constant companions. Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a new form of faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic radiation crackles around her ship, a silent threat in the vast emptiness of space, but the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, outweighs the danger. The galaxy is a vast ocean, and she, a lone voyager, sails its starlit waves.
