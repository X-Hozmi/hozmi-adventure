
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse.  His quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the ailing King, a journey fraught with peril not just from mythical creatures, but thieving bandits, impassable rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of surviving another day closer to his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst colossal cosmic wonders.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval knights.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, rogue asteroid fields demanded precise maneuvering, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurked in the shadows of unexplored systems. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovery, fueled her onward, pushing her and her crew to the limits of their technology and courage.
