
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very terrain itself seemed determined to hinder his progress.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: fording swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for scarce provisions in dusty villages.  Yet, with every mile, the allure of Jerusalem, the whispered legends of the East, fueled his weary limbs and hardened his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but navigating the treacherous gravitational currents and unpredictable wormholes between galaxies demanded unwavering skill and nerve.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, was a constant reminder of both the immense distances and the overwhelming fragility of life in the cosmos. The fate of the colonists – and the secrets they held – rested on her shoulders.
