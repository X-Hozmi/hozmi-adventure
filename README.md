The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through a forest haunted by whispers of goblins and the ever-present threat of bandit ambushes.

Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and bring back vital data.  The vastness of space, while perilous, promised discovery far exceeding any earthly adventure.
