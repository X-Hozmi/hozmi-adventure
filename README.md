
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary horses plodded through the mud, the stench of rain-soaked earth mingling with the ever-present aroma of woodsmoke from distant villages. Their journey to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of a new challenge, each sunset the grim satisfaction of surviving another day on the unforgiving medieval road.  The goal, a distant Jerusalem, seemed as elusive as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's engines humming a low, comforting drone against the vast, silent expanse of space.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the besieged colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic courier.  The universe, though breathtakingly beautiful, held dangers that dwarfed even the most perilous medieval journey.
