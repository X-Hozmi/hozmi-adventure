
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the mythical city of Eldoria.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush, or worse – the whispered dread of the plague that stalked the land.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to harbor advanced civilizations.  The journey, a months-long odyssey across light-years, was fraught with its own perils – unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on unsuspecting transports.  But the potential discovery of new technologies and alien cultures far outweighed the risks for the intrepid captain.
