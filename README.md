
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence in fiery hues.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from glamorous.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the kindness of strangers, the sting of hunger, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in shadowed forests. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead. Yet, with every mile, her resolve grew stronger, fueled by faith and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Unlike Elara's journey, Ryla's was technologically advanced, but no less perilous.  Warp jumps were unpredictable, alien encounters often hostile, and the loneliness of interstellar travel a constant companion.  The vast distances between planets, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the constant threat of malfunctioning systems, however, only enhanced the epic scale of her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and bring them home.
