
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward. The journey across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine was proving longer and more treacherous than any chronicle had foretold.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, the scorching sun beat down relentlessly, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Yet, the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, fueled his relentless pursuit across the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life beyond human comprehension.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems, she and her crew faced perils far beyond those encountered by medieval knights.  The vastness of space, the unknown lurking behind each newly charted star, held a different kind of adventure, a cosmic gamble that promised either spectacular discovery or utter annihilation.
