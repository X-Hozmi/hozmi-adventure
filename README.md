
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires – a city of gold, said to be guarded by mythical beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, sent a thrill of both fear and anticipation through him.  He carried with him a tattered map, a worn sword, and a desperate hope for fortune, or at least, survival.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship *Stardust* through a nebula of shimmering turquoise. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the discovery of a new energy source vital to the survival of the human colonies. The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, the potential for disaster lurking in every unforeseen celestial event.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, each jump to hyperspace a gamble, but the possibility of securing Kepler-186f's resources fueled her courage and spurred her on towards the unknown.
