
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty – a hidden valley carpeted in wildflowers – and terrifying danger – the ambush of bandits or the sudden storm that could swallow the trail whole.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of reaching the sacred city fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the shimmering trails of nebulae and the faint whispers of wormhole signatures, her crew charted a course to the unmapped Xylos system.  The thrill of discovery burned brighter than any sun, but the unknown held its own terrors: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies capable of shattering hulls, and the chilling possibility of encountering alien life forms far more advanced – or far more hostile – than humanity.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
