
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small price to pay for the hope shimmering on the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals across three galaxies to the ailing Republic.  Hyperspace jumps were routine, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes, coupled with the ever-present threat of pirate raids and rogue black holes, kept the adrenaline pumping.  The vast expanse of space offered breathtaking views – swirling nebulae painted across the void, distant suns blazing with incandescent fire – but survival required constant vigilance and unwavering skill.
