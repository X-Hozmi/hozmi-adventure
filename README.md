
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Iberian Peninsula stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and hardtack; it held the weight of her family's hopes, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela a desperate gamble against the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, heightened the adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers and the unwavering beauty of the journey across untamed lands. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were companions as real as the star-dusted nights.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gazed out the viewport of her starship, the Milky Way a swirling river of light beyond the hull.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped Kepler-186f system, a perilous journey across light-years of empty space. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, masking the silent threat of asteroid fields and rogue black holes.  Each jump to warp speed was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the vast indifference of the cosmos.  The adventure wasn't just about discovery; it was about facing the infinite and finding humanity's place within it.
