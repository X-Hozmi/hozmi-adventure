
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic clip-clop of her mule a counterpoint to the wind's mournful whisper.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and, perhaps, miracle.  The map, a tattered scroll, was her only guide through the labyrinthine wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far side of the galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of pirate attacks, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling vastness of space itself.   Her crew, a motley collection of skilled pilots and hardened explorers, navigated asteroid fields and navigated diplomatic tensions with alien races, their courage tested by the infinite possibilities and perils of interstellar travel.  The galaxy was their canvas, and the journey, an epic painted in starlight and danger.
