
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by a desperate hope to find a cure for her ailing brother.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, tested her resilience at every turn.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, masking the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies and the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and the unpredictable behavior of wormholes.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and wondrous expanse, offered a different kind of challenge than Elara's, but the spirit of adventure – the burning desire to explore the unknown – remained the same.
