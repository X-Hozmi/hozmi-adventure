
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in hues of orange and purple.  Her journey to the fabled monastery at Glastonbury was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown propelled her forward, a determined glint in her eye that mirrored the distant, glittering stars. This pilgrimage, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, was her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of a thousand blazing suns.  Faster-than-light travel had opened up the galaxy, but the dangers remained: unpredictable wormholes, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters. Jax, however, felt the familiar thrill of exploration surge through her veins. Each jump to a new star system, each risky negotiation with a foreign species, was a step further into the infinite tapestry of the cosmos. The galaxy was her playground, her challenge, her endless adventure.
