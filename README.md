
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky. My quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging my village.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation were constant companions, but the hope of salvation fueled my weary body, pushing me onward through the unforgiving landscape. Every sunrise was a gamble, every sunset a victory hard-won.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast emptiness of intergalactic space. My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space pirates of the Orion Arm was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political intrigue waiting on Xylos itself.  But the potential to bridge the unfathomable distances separating star systems, to connect the galaxy, outweighed any risk. The journey to Xylos was just the beginning.
