
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the rumored City of Whispers, a place said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog was a potential threat, bandits a constant shadow in the periphery, but the whispered promise of healing propelled her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across rushing rivers, an intrepid adventurer in a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of the galaxy painting her viewport in breathtaking hues.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with undiscovered life and fraught with unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was all in a day’s work for a seasoned spacefarer, but the true adventure lay in the vast unknown, in the thrill of exploring the cosmos and uncovering the secrets held within distant, alien worlds.
