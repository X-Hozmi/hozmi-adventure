
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to curing her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown. Yet, the unwavering hope fueled her journey, the promise of Ys a shimmering beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova"  Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas. His mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien star charts, Rexx faced dangers beyond human comprehension. Yet, the echo of Aethel's distress signal, faint but persistent, kept him pushing forward into the vast, uncharted expanse of space.
