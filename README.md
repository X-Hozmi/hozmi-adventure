
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already conquered.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air as I pressed onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  My destination, the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend among the travelling merchants, beckoned with promises of untold riches and perilous encounters.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown that propelled me forward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Stars blurred past in streaks of vibrant color as we leaped across the galaxy, our destination the Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity.   The crew, a motley collection of scientists, engineers, and hardened spacers,  watched with a mixture of awe and apprehension as the familiar spiral of our own galaxy faded, replaced by the strange, alien beauty of uncharted space.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less fraught with danger; asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life demanded constant vigilance and unwavering courage.
