
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward. The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the promised riches of the Orient.  His journey, fraught with peril, had already seen skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of fabled cities and untold treasures fuelled his relentless pursuit, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms was commonplace; the vastness of space held its own unique brand of adventure.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, but the weight of her mission – the hope of a new beginning for her people – propelled her forward, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
