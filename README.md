
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered legends of Ys, and the hope it represents, fuels his relentless journey across a land both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation are all part of a spacefarer's life.  Yet the lure of the unknown, the chance to discover new worlds and civilizations, propels her across the vast emptiness of space, a journey far removed from the dusty roads of old, but no less perilous or rewarding.
