
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The biting wind whipped at my cloak, a constant reminder of the perils that lay ahead.  My destination:  the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets older than time itself.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in the pursuit of my grand quest.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a desperate hope that tomorrow would bring me closer to my goal.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we leaped across the void between galaxies.  The starfield outside the viewport shimmered with a breathtaking kaleidoscope of colours, each a testament to the vast, unexplored universe stretching before us.  Our mission:  to chart a course through the unmapped Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The risks were immense – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, hostile species. But the potential rewards – a new home, a new beginning – made the daunting journey worthwhile.
