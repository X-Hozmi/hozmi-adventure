
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, holds the potential for banditry, or worse.  She seeks the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient magic, a journey fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, the lurking threat of wild beasts, and the ever-present danger of encountering warring factions.  Her only companions are her wits, her loyal mule, and the unwavering hope that fuels her quest.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey is less fraught with physical danger than with the unknown – uncharted wormholes, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions operating in the lawless reaches of space.  The vastness of the cosmos, a tapestry of breathtaking beauty and unimaginable perils, stretches before her, each jump a gamble against the odds, each star a beacon and a potential hazard in her relentless pursuit of discovery.
