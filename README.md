
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey from Aquitaine to Constantinople, a pilgrimage driven by a desperate hope to find a cure for her ailing brother. The vast, unforgiving landscape tested her resilience, yet the allure of the distant city, a beacon of whispered legend and rumored remedies, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The jump through hyperspace had been harrowing, the ship buffeted by gravitational tides unseen by human eyes.  But the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovering new life forms and charting unmapped territories, outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held the same potent mixture of danger and hope as the medieval pathways, a testament to humanity’s enduring quest for the unknown.
