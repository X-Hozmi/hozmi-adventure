
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a collection of rare herbs destined for a monastery far beyond the crest.  Each winding path held the promise of danger – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous landslides, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the fierce independence, and the burning desire to deliver her precious cargo fueled her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, awe-inspiring landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet within a newly discovered galaxy cluster.  The journey, though measured in light years rather than days, held a similar allure to Elara's.  The vast, cold emptiness of space, the potential for alien encounters, the technological challenges – these were Ryla’s mountains, her bandits, her hunger.  The allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of the known, remained a timeless human drive, echoing across millennia and the gulf between mule tracks and hyperspace.
