
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped securely behind him, its weight a constant reminder of the peril he faced.  His journey across the treacherous, war-torn lands of Francia had been fraught with ambushes by bandits, skirmishes with rival knights, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the promise of glory and riches spurred him on, a flickering candle in the darkness of his arduous pilgrimage.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a far-flung galaxy.  The dangers weren't bandits or disease, but unpredictable gravitational fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment malfunction.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars, was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly isolating.  But the promise of scientific advancement, and the thrill of exploring the unknown, fueled her relentless pursuit of the mission's objective.
