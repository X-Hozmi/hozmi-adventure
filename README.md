
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  The journey to Avignon, to plead her brother's case before the Pope, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes hid in shadowed valleys, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked travelers like a phantom. Yet, with each creaking step of her faithful beast, Elara felt a thrill—the exhilaration of the unknown, the power of her own resolve against the vast, uncaring landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of vibrant color. His sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way, a journey spanning millennia for slower vessels.  The thrill wasn't just the speed; it was the sheer audacity of charting unmapped nebulae, facing the unpredictable dangers of cosmic storms and alien encounters, each jump a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of space.  The frontier called, and Rexx answered.
