
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked frame, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the smell of parched earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling certainty of death on this unforgiving journey.  He pressed on, driven by hope and the grim determination to return with a miracle.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints.  Their mission: to locate a rumored energy source capable of jump-starting a dying galactic federation.  The dangers weren't bandits or wild beasts, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure light years from any friendly spaceport.  Yet, driven by a sense of duty and the potential to save countless lives, Elara steered her ship towards the unknown.
