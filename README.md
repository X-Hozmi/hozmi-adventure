
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the dangers he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unknown.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a test of his courage and endurance against the raw, untamed beauty of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational currents.  Alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, punctuated the voyage.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, dwarfed even the greatest medieval challenges. The search for humanity's lost brethren pushed Elara and her crew to their limits, their courage fuelled by the hope of rediscovering a lost piece of their history.
