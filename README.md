
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plateau stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it holds the weight of her family's hopes, entrusted to her as she journeys to Constantinople to seek a rumored cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind in the sparse scrub, is a reminder of the perilous journey ahead – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease are just some of the obstacles she must overcome.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted to the uncharted Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, masking the vast silence of interstellar space.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known galaxies, face the unknown with a mix of apprehension and excitement. The potential for discovery is matched only by the risks – rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations all loom large as they venture into the cosmic unknown.
