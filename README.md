
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Castile, the midday heat shimmering on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, which stalked the land like a phantom.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, every sunset a prayer for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f,  rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying home planet.  Warp jumps were treacherous, asteroid fields a constant threat, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a cold, unforgiving reality.  But the potential reward—the survival of her people—fueled her journey across the uncharted galaxies.
