
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her late father's map.  The parchment promised a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends fueling her journey, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable backdrop of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic storms and pirate raids, her crew her only family against the cold vacuum of space. The allure of discovery, the hope of finding life beyond their own, fueled her relentless pursuit across the boundless expanse, a voyage as daring as any medieval quest.
