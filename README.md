
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward.  The midday sun beat down on the seemingly endless expanse of the Breton countryside, the only sounds the rhythmic clop of hooves and the distant cry of a hawk.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and meager rations, represented all she possessed; a perilous journey to the monastery at Saint-Michel-en-Grève, seeking a cure for her ailing brother, lay before her.  Each rolling hill, each shadowed forest, held the potential for both beauty and danger – bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and the gravitational pull of unknown celestial bodies was routine, but the thrill of discovery never faded.  Their mission: to chart unmapped nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of swirling colors and distant suns, offered a different kind of peril – cosmic radiation, engine failures, and the unknown entities lurking in the unexplored corners of the universe.  Yet, the potential rewards - new worlds, new knowledge - fueled their relentless pursuit.
