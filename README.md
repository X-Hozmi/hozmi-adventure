
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained the King's decree, a risky mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Toledo.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the dreaded Black Death, already claiming lives across the land.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a gamble against fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The mission, a perilous search for new resources and habitable worlds for humanity's expanding diaspora, was filled with the constant threat of spatial anomalies and pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, tested her courage and the limits of her starship’s technology, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
