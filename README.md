
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his weary mule through the dense Ardennes forest.  His knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, promises riches beyond the whispering trees – the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, of unearthing a forgotten civilization, fuels his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant galaxies, is both breathtaking and terrifying.  Engine failures, pirate attacks from the Kryll Confederacy, and the ever-present risk of encountering uncharted anomalies are all part of the galactic frontier.  Yet, Eva, driven by humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery and the hope of finding a new home among the stars, presses onward, charting a course into the unknown.
