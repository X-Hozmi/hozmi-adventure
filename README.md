
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the ongoing plague.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Ys, and the hope it represents, fuels his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval adventurers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hum, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies as Eva charts a course through uncharted space.  The vastness of the cosmos is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the dangers that lie beyond the known stars.  Yet, the promise of discovery and the potential to reunite with lost kin propel her forward, a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity's interstellar pioneers.
