The biting wind whipped across the snow-covered plains of the Eastern Steppes, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards I'd left behind weeks ago.  My quest, to find the mythical Sunstone rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging my homeland, drove me through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the unforgiving embrace of the vast unknown. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new encounter with both the beauty and brutality of the medieval world.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive, a comforting roar in the deafening silence of interstellar space.  Gazing out the viewport, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted a breathtaking canvas against the backdrop of a million distant stars. Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of wormholes and rogue asteroids. The vast expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single ship in the immensity of the galaxy.
