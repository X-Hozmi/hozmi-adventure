Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, squinted towards the distant, hazy mountains.  This journey across the kingdom, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.

Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
