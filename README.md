
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guided her through treacherous mountain passes and across swollen rivers, each step a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the plague.  This journey to Constantinople, to find the lost scroll of her ancestors, was a tapestry woven with danger and the intoxicating allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  The hyperspace jump had been brutal, throwing her crew against their restraints, but the breathtaking view of Xylos's swirling gases and orbiting moons was worth the momentary discomfort.  Their mission: to recover a vital energy source from a long-lost colony on the planet below.  The dangers were different – alien predators, hostile environments, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – but the thrill of exploration burned just as bright as it did in Elara's time.
