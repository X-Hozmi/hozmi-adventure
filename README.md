
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara's small caravan struggled onward.  Their destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and potent magic.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the relentless sun, the ever-present threat of bandits, and the gnawing hunger in their bellies.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle for survival, a testament to the unwavering human spirit that pushed them towards their elusive goal, despite the treacherous landscapes and the ever-present shadow of despair.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula the colour of amethyst and blood. Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for colonization.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of space remained a constant, humbling challenge.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear their ship apart, while the unknown dangers lurking in uncharted systems kept every crew member on high alert.  The journey was fraught with peril, yet the lure of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, fueled their relentless quest among the stars.
