
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the ravaged lands of Aquitaine was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and power, fueled her onward, each aching muscle a testament to her unwavering resolve.  This was no mere pilgrimage; it was a gamble with fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Sparks' Valerius steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to Kepler-186f, a planet light years away, a world teeming with potential but facing environmental collapse.  The dangers were different now – hostile alien factions, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of system failure.  But the allure of exploration, the chance to shape a new world, burned brighter than any distant sun, a driving force stronger than any gravity well.
