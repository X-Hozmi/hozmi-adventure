
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and the tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient healing secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the lingering chill of the Black Death’s shadow.  This journey, fraught with peril, was her only hope.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Kerrigan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony struggling against hostile indigenous lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, but the dangers were no less real – pirate attacks, navigational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of void-quakes that could shatter a ship in an instant.  This interstellar voyage, a gamble for survival, was a testament to human resilience and the unending quest for new frontiers.
