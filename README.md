
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey across the Duchy of Aquitaine was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new river to ford, and the constant gnawing uncertainty of their destination.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the King, was a race against time, and the unpredictable landscape felt as much an enemy as any human foe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the Kepler-186f colony, a planet light-years from her homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions, was a daily reality.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held its own brand of terror, a lonely expanse where help was galaxies away. The success of her mission rested solely on her skill, her crew, and the reliability of her aging starship.
