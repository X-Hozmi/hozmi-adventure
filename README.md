
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and the King's decree – a dangerous commission to deliver a message to the far north.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter.  Yet, with every step, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a desperate need for discovery tempering the ever-present fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be guarded by sentient crystalline beings.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships were everyday occurrences, but the sheer scale of the cosmos, the humbling immensity of space, never ceased to inspire a sense of awe.  The risks were exponentially greater, the distances incomprehensible, but the promise of the unknown beckoned, pulling him ever deeper into the vast expanse.
