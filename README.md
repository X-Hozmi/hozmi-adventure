
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable power.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting her own path across the untamed landscape, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the swirling nebulae outside his starship a breathtaking kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and gas. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory K'tharr raiders demanded not just skill but courage, a reliance on his crew, and an unwavering belief in the mission's worth. The vast, unpredictable expanse of space offered unimaginable dangers, but also the limitless potential of discovery.
