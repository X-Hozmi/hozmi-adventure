
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, or worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of King Arthur.  The journey was fraught with peril, demanding both courage and cunning to navigate treacherous terrain and hostile encounters.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps was commonplace, but the unknown dangers of uncharted space were a constant threat.  Alien lifeforms, temporal distortions, and the ever-present risk of system failure all tested the limits of her skill and resolve as she pursued her mission – a search for life beyond humanity's cradle.
