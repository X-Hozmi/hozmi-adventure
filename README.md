
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving river of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  The air hangs thick with the scent of sweat, dried dung, and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each sunrise brings the promise of breathtaking landscapes – rolling hills giving way to towering mountains, ancient ruins whispering tales of forgotten empires – but also the constant fear of the unknown:  a sudden sandstorm, a rogue wolf pack, or the more insidious danger of disease and starvation. Our destination, Constantinople, seems a distant, shimmering mirage, a prize for surviving the relentless challenges of the medieval road.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant, comforting thrum against the vast, inky blackness of space.  We're traversing the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in generations.  While the physical dangers are less immediate – no marauding bandits, thankfully – the mental strain of interstellar travel is immense.  The vast emptiness, the isolating silence punctuated only by the ship's systems, the ever-present awareness of the fragility of our vessel against the unforgiving void... these are the challenges we face as we push the boundaries of human exploration, seeking new worlds and a future amongst the stars.
