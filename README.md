
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed and stained with rain and sweat, depicting a route to the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dense forest, was a potential threat – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  His journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of glory fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling lights of distant stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the fragile life support systems were their only defense against the unforgiving vacuum of space.  Yet, the hope of forging a new future for humanity propelled them forward, across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
