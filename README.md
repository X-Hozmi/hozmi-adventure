
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a legendary metropolis said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aeridor, but the promise of glory and discovery spurred him on, each sunrise a renewed pledge to reach his destination.

Her mission: to chart the unmapped nebulae of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

But the allure of the unknown, and the chance to rewrite the laws of interstellar travel, fueled her unwavering determination.
