The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering peaks scraped the bruised purple sky, while the valley below teemed with the unseen dangers of bandits and wild beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the thrill of his journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, a quest both perilous and promising untold riches and glory.
