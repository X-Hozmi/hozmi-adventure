
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, the scent of woodsmoke and unwashed bodies clinging to the air.  My destination: Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the Black Forest, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep me away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from haggling with surly innkeepers to navigating treacherous mountain passes.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands, fueled my weary steps onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we leaped across the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside were breathtaking, a canvas of cosmic artistry painted across the infinite expanse. Our mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  While the dangers were less tangible than bandits and disease – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, unknown alien lifeforms – the scale of the challenge was far greater.  Each jump represented a leap of faith, a gamble against the uncaring vastness of space.
