
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the oppressive heat.  Each bend held the potential for ambush by bandits or worse – the whispered tales of mythical creatures lurking in the shadowed glades fueled his every step.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, seeking a cure for the plague that ravaged his village.  The journey was perilous, but the hope of salvation spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of distant stars, was a different kind of wilderness, far more isolating than any forest.  Yet, the challenges were equally immense – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, maintaining the ship's fragile life support systems, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. The allure of discovery, however, propelled her across the galaxy, a modern-day knight errant charting unmapped territories.
