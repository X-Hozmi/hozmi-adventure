
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her on this perilous journey to the distant monastery rumored to possess a cure for the plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the ever-present tension, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that stalked these lonely roads.  Survival was an adventure in itself, a brutal test of endurance and cunning.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the remote Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with unpredictable solar flares and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions.  Navigating hyperspace, dodging asteroid fields, and facing alien life forms were all part of the routine, but this time, a sense of unease gnawed at her – a feeling that this expedition held far more danger than the standard galactic patrol run.
