
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a forest brooding with the secrets of centuries.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, pushed him ever forward into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all part of the perilous voyage.  But the promise of rediscovering lost kin, and unlocking the secrets of a forgotten civilization, fueled her determination to reach her destination, no matter the cost.
