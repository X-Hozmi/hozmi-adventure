
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crests a windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispered promise of salvation fuels his unwavering determination, pushing him further along the arduous, uncertain path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre, alien lifeforms are mere inconveniences compared to the political intrigue and corporate espionage that threaten her mission.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, also holds unimaginable dangers, and the weight of her crew's lives rests heavily on Eva's shoulders as she pushes the boundaries of human exploration into the uncharted darkness.
