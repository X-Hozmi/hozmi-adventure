
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood, a grim reminder of the bandit ambush a day past.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril across treacherous mountain passes, hostile lands, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his stubborn resolve.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope amidst the vast, uncaring emptiness of space.  Warp drives hummed, battling the gravitational pull of celestial giants, while automated systems monitored the ship's integrity against the onslaught of cosmic radiation.  The journey was a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of machinery and the occasional static crackle of interstellar comms, but the thought of those lost colonists fueled her relentless pursuit across the infinite expanse.
