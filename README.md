
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned – a chipped map, a few dried fruits, and the whispered promise of a new life in the far-off city of Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and wonder. Bandits, disease, and the endless expanse of the unknown stretched before her, a test of her courage and resilience.  This journey was not merely travel; it was a pilgrimage to a better future.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity among a thousand glittering stars. The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant reminder of the impossible distances they conquered.  Ahead lay the challenges of alien landscapes, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But for Eva and her crew, the vastness of space was not a barrier, but an invitation to explore the mysteries of the cosmos and chart a new destiny for their species.
