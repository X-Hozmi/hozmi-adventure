
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each flash of steel from a passing mercenary band, held the potential for both peril and progress on this perilous journey across a war-torn continent. The trail was marked not by maps, but by the grit of determination and the whispers of rumour.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and untold dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes, Eva relied on cutting-edge technology and her unwavering crew. The vast expanse of space held not only the promise of discovery but also the terrifying unknown, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of Earth's orbit, a loneliness even more profound than any medieval knight could ever have known.
