
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in rocky canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of silks, spices, and untold riches fuels our relentless journey, each day a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, a test of endurance and courage against a world both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar exploration, leaps across the void, its course charted through nebulae and past dying suns. Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, a tapestry woven with the hum of the hyperdrive and the shared anxieties of a crew pushing the boundaries of human endeavor.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a frontier where the unknown holds both incredible promise and the chilling possibility of oblivion.
