
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke battling the ever-present stench of mud.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the biting wind, but the thrill of her journey – a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude – kept her spirits high.  Each creak of the saddle, each rumble of her horse's hooves, was a testament to the miles conquered, a rhythm echoing the beating of her adventurous heart. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges she faced on her solitary quest.

A thousand years hence, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of breathtaking colours, the ship's AI murmuring navigation corrections.  Galaxies spun like cosmic pinwheels outside their viewport, a breathtaking panorama contrasting sharply with the sterile, metallic interior.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital mineral from the ice planet of Xylos, a perilous journey involving gravity wells, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  The vastness of space, however, dwarfed even these threats, inspiring both awe and a profound sense of isolation in Rexa and her crew.
