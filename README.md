
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown. Each day brought new challenges, new landscapes, and a growing sense of wonder at the vastness of the world stretching before him, a tapestry woven with danger and destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost amongst the swirling galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields, outwitting space pirates, and the constant threat of engine failure were all part of a cosmic journey that dwarfed even the most daring medieval expeditions.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the unimaginable scale of the universe, and the potential for discovery ignited a fire within her, a thirst for exploration that echoed the adventurous spirit of those medieval knights who dared to dream beyond their horizons.
