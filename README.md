
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the lost relic of Saint Jude, rumored to be hidden within the treacherous Black Forest.  Each day brings new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, perilous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispered legends of the relic's power, and the desperate pleas of his King, fuel his resolve to press onward, despite the seemingly endless expanse of road ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Warp drives hum, battling the gravitational pull of distant suns as Eva navigates treacherous asteroid fields and encounters alien life forms both wondrous and terrifying.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic wonders and unknown dangers, is her arena, a challenge to her courage and navigational skill as she pushes the boundaries of human exploration.
