
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hastily scribbled notes, was her only guide to the legendary Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, already claiming victims in nearby villages.  Survival meant navigating treacherous terrain, bartering for meager supplies, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormhole currents, was a test of both her piloting skills and her crew's resolve.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, amplified the stakes of their quest – a single malfunction could mean the difference between triumphant return and oblivion among the silent stars.
