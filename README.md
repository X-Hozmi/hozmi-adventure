
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a jostling mass of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings the promise of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, a constant tension that sharpens the senses.  The whispered tales of djinn and lost oases fuel our journey, a desperate hope against the harsh reality of scorching deserts and unforgiving mountains.  The lure of legend, however, outweighs the peril, driving us ever onward toward the unknown.


Centuries hence, the stars are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across light-years, charting unmapped nebulae and encountering civilizations as alien as the cosmic dust swirling around us.  The thrill isn't just in the breathtaking views of planets born of swirling gas giants, but also in the contact with sentient lifeforms, some friendly, others… less so. Each jump into hyperspace is a gamble, a breathtaking leap of faith into the vast, uncaring expanse of the universe, a journey fueled by curiosity and the relentless human need to explore.
