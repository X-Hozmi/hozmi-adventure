Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by witches and worse.  Their quest: to reach the distant city of Prague, bearing a vital message for the King.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mix of fear and determination as they ventured deeper into the unknown, relying on meager supplies and the strength of their fellowship.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable alien flora and fauna.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the dangers were just as real: pirate attacks, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  The vastness of the cosmos was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the ultimate test of courage and skill.
