
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his horse, echoed the weight of his ambition against the backdrop of a world both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.  The cosmos, a canvas of shimmering dust and swirling gas, held both wonders beyond imagining and dangers unseen;  alien lifeforms, gravitational anomalies, and the relentless pressure of interstellar travel were constant companions on her perilous voyage across the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
