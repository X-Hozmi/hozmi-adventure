
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King, a desperate plea for aid against a relentless siege.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, heightens the tension, transforming the journey into a perilous game of cat and mouse with bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The towering mountains themselves feel like watchful giants, their peaks piercing the stormy sky, mirroring the storm brewing in her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of rare isotopes across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unstable wormholes and unpredictable pirate fleets.  The cold, sterile hum of the ship’s engines contrasts sharply with the vibrant colours of the nebula, a breathtaking yet treacherous backdrop to her interstellar voyage.  The success of her mission hinges on her skill, her courage, and a healthy dose of luck amidst the cosmic unknown.
