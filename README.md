
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air. Her worn leather map, a patchwork of faded inks and frantic scribbles, guided her towards the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons, and the relentless sun threatened to claim her before she reached her destination.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed beauty and danger of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through a nebula of vibrant, swirling colours.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in a distant galaxy, a world rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigation was a delicate dance between gravitational pulls and unpredictable asteroid fields, a far cry from the simpler challenges of medieval travel.  Yet, the thrill was the same – the unknown, the push beyond the familiar, the exhilarating gamble of charting a course into the vast and mysterious expanse of space.
