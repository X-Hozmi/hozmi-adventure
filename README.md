
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's mule plodded onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried figs, a well-thumbed map, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – and the thrilling unknown that fuelled her perilous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering veil of a nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her starship.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of uncharted space.  The thrill of discovery, the vastness of the universe, and the possibility of encountering alien life propelled her forward, despite the immense risks and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.
