
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hurried scribbles, promised a hidden monastery nestled within the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on her quest to find a legendary healing herb, her only hope for her ailing brother. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of discovery and the icy grip of fear in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust swirling around her ship like a cosmic storm.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kryll crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien glyphs were all in a day's work.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held the promise of unimaginable riches—or a swift, fiery end.
