
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and, perhaps, a miraculous end to his arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, Eva and her crew faced dangers far removed from the medieval knight's struggles, yet no less perilous.  The vast emptiness of space, the unpredictable nature of alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of equipment failure tested their courage and skill at every turn. The galaxy held countless mysteries, and their quest was just the beginning of a journey across the cosmos.
