
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, a pilgrimage to a mythical healing spring, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispered tales of griffins and other monstrous beasts kept her perpetually on edge.  Yet, the glint of hope – the promise of salvation for her ailing brother – spurred her onward through the unforgiving terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, was a perilous one.  Wormholes, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each hyperspace jump a gamble.  But the promise of a new life, a chance to escape the overpopulated and decaying Earth, fueled her and her crew, propelling them across the vast emptiness between worlds.
