
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the skeletal remains of a long-dead castle looming in the distance.  Her worn leather map, crinkled and stained with rain, guided her across treacherous mountain passes and through whispering forests teeming with bandits and mythical creatures. Each sunrise brought new peril, each sunset the fragile hope of reaching her destination: the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  The journey tested her limits, but the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a breathtaking contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the bridge.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of space remained a constant, humbling reminder of humanity's fragility.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of resources or a deadly trap.  The quest for new worlds demanded courage, skill, and a relentless pursuit of the unknown.
