
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, clutched tightly in her gloved hand, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the familiar, fuels her onward, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Conversely,  Captain Rexx strides the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, a starship far removed from the medieval mud and grime.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vast expanse of the cosmos presents a different kind of hardship; navigating asteroid fields, contending with temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien civilizations. The journey demands precise calculations, unwavering focus, and the courage to face the infinite possibilities – and dangers – of the unexplored galaxy.
