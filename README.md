
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them on, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering belief in a miraculous salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vastness of space, punctuated by breathtaking celestial wonders and the ever-present hum of the hyperdrive, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump to hyperspace held the risk of encountering unforeseen anomalies, pirate fleets, or the silent, crushing weight of the void itself.  But the promise of discovery, of a new dawn for mankind, fueled Eva's courage and drove her ever further into the uncharted expanse.
