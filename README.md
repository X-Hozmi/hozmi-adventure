
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  The journey was perilous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of wild beasts echoed through the night. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, pushing her through the unforgiving landscapes of a medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars, the constant threat of asteroid fields, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown alien lifeforms kept her crew on edge.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite, yet the potential for a new beginning propelled them forward across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
