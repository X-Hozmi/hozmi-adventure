
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he rides across the parched plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in his gauntlet.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions, testing his courage and the loyalty of his small band of weary companions. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a chance to reflect on the perilous journey ahead, a journey fueled by hope, greed, and the enduring human desire for adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity’s expanding population.  Warp drives hum, battling the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Alien encounters – both friendly and hostile – punctuate the vast emptiness between stars. The weight of billions rests on Eva's shoulders, the success or failure of the mission determining the fate of her species.  Yet, despite the colossal scale of the endeavor, it is the thrill of exploration, the yearning for the unknown, that fuels her tireless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
