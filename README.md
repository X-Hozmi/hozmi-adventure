
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and sharing stories around crackling campfires with fellow travelers – each tale a testament to the harsh beauty and unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a symphony of starlight and swirling nebulae, punctuated by the hum of the ship’s engines and the crackle of subspace communications.  Eva navigated asteroid fields, dodged rogue planets, and battled cosmic storms, her crew a band of hardened explorers facing the vast, uncaring immensity of space with courage and unwavering determination.
