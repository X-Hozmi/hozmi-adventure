
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was far from the romantic tales spun in taverns.  Each day was a grueling test of endurance: treacherous bogs, thieving bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of sickness.  Their pack horses strained under the weight of supplies, and the rhythmic clop of hooves was a constant counterpoint to the gnawing hunger in their bellies. Yet, with every sunrise, the unwavering belief in their holy mission pushed them closer to their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a feat considered suicidal by many.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the cold glitter of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue plasma storms, and repairing critical systems in zero gravity were daily challenges. But the potential for discovery, the thrill of charting unknown worlds and perhaps encountering alien life, fueled her courage.  The universe waited, and Eva Rostova, along with her intrepid crew, were ready to explore.
