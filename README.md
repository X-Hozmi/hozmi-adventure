
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she spurred her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating treacherous river crossings to bartering for meager sustenance in unfriendly villages. Yet, the unwavering belief in her quest fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel.  Unlike the limitations of Elara’s era, Eva navigated by starlight and hyperspace jumps, yet the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and unknown alien lifeforms lurked in the uncharted sectors.  But the promise of a flourishing future for humanity, fueled by the energy of Aethel, drove Eva and her crew across the unyielding expanse of the cosmos.
