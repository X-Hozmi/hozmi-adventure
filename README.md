
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's ragged band crested the hill, the distant spires of Camelot a shimmering mirage in the afternoon sun.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken them across treacherous mountains and sun-baked plains, their journey fraught with peril from bandits, rogue knights, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, demanding resilience and cunning to survive, their quest for the mythical Sunstone a driving force against the bleak reality of their harsh existence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas clouds a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous voyage.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became commonplace in this era of galactic exploration, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space itself.  The vastness of the cosmos both terrified and exhilarated, a reminder of the boundless wonders and deadly dangers that awaited them.
