
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.  The sun beat down mercilessly, and the nights were filled with the eerie cries of wild animals and the rustling of unseen dangers in the dark forests.  His only companions were his loyal squire and the unwavering hope that spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, lost somewhere amidst the uncharted star systems of the Andromeda galaxy.  Facing down cosmic radiation, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and battling the ever-present threat of pirates, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology.  The vast expanse of space held both wonder and peril, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unknown, a thrilling leap into the heart of the cosmos.
