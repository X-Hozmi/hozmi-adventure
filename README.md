
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing fear of starvation in the desolate plains.  But the whispered promise of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis in a sea of hardship, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery.  The journey was a perilous dance with wormholes, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting with a lost civilization, fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
