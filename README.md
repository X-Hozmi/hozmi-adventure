
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the dust-choked road in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of our laden packhorses was a counterpoint to the rhythmic beat of our horses' hooves – a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were familiar companions on our quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the key to a forgotten magic.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The sleek lines of the 'Starseeker' sliced through the inky blackness, the swirling nebulae outside a mesmerizing spectacle.  Our mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet orbiting Kepler-186f, a world light-years from our own.  The dangers were different now –  hyper-space anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the thrill of the unknown, the siren call of discovery, remained as potent as ever.
