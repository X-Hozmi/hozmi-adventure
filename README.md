
Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a whispering forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Eadric – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed territories of bandit lords. Each day brought fresh peril, from the snapping jaws of wolves to the chilling whispers of superstition clinging to the ancient stones.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a far-flung galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the insidious effects of prolonged hyperspace travel were all in a day's work.  The universe, vast and unforgiving, held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying dangers, but Eva, fueled by the spirit of exploration that burned bright within, pressed onward towards the unknown.
