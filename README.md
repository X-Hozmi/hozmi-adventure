
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, press onward. Their journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists, is fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – a ford to cross, a village to barter with, a desperate plea for aid from a beleaguered farmer.  Their quest is not for gold, but for knowledge, a journey as perilous as any dragon's hoard.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship *Hope*, vanished without a trace near the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps are risky, navigation charts are unreliable, and the vast unknown teems with unpredictable celestial phenomena. Every jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic abyss. But Eva, driven by hope and the memory of lost friends, continues her relentless pursuit, knowing the fate of hundreds rests upon her shoulders and the fragile integrity of her aging vessel.
