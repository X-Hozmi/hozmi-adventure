
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies – it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried across the unforgiving landscape to a distant kingdom.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of this unforgiving medieval world. Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions on this perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a soothing counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  This wasn't a journey measured in days or weeks, but in subjective time warped by the warp drive.  The risks were different here – cosmic radiation, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life – yet the thrill of exploration burned as brightly as the distant stars.
