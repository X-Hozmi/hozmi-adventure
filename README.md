
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each creak of my pack, each labored breath, echoed the monumental journey ahead – a pilgrimage to Rome, fueled by a desperate hope for healing and a thirst for the unknown.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving landscape a test of endurance, but the thrill of discovery, the allure of reaching a distant city steeped in legend, propelled me onward.  The whispers of forgotten gods and ancient empires whispered on the wind, promising adventure at every turn.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, my journey was measured in light years, not miles, the dangers cosmic rays and rogue asteroids instead of bandits and blizzards.  Yet, the spirit of adventure remained unchanged. The vastness of space, the breathtaking nebulae swirling outside our viewport, and the tantalizing mystery of the unknown fueled a sense of wonder as potent as any medieval quest.
