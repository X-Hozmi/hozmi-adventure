
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed several men to sickness and exhaustion.  Each creaking wagon wheel was a testament to the unforgiving terrain, every sunset a gamble against bandits and the encroaching night.  They traveled through forests haunted by whispers of ancient magic, forded rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated treacherous mountain passes, their resolve tested by the harsh realities of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy had been fraught with peril – a near-miss with a rogue asteroid field and a harrowing encounter with a K'tharr raiding party a mere week prior.  The crew, weary but resolute, worked tirelessly, charting unexplored systems and scanning for habitable planets, their mission to secure a new home for humanity amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.  The risks were immense, but the promise of discovery far outweighed the dangers.
