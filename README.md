
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of Eldoria's legendary spires, visible only on the clearest days across the vast expanse, fueled their weary hearts and spurred them on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of peril than the medieval knight faced, but the drive to reach a promised land – a chance for survival and a new beginning – burned just as brightly within her.
