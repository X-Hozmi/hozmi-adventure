
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the rumors of a hidden monastery fueled her journey, a desperate quest for a cure for her ailing brother. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat or a sign of the next village, a gamble played out against the backdrop of a vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was arduous, fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across light-years of uncharted space.  While the dangers were less immediate than a bandit ambush, the cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships posed a different kind of peril.  Yet, the allure of discovery and the possibility of finding a lost civilization drove her across the vast emptiness between stars.
