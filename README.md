
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of the fabled Silk Road, with its whispered tales of exotic spices and unimaginable riches, pushes us onward, each creaking wheel a testament to our shared ambition and the indomitable human spirit.  The nights are filled with star-gazing, campfire stories, and the quiet anticipation of what tomorrow will bring.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship bristling with advanced technology, cuts a path through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, the silence punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the crackle of the comms system. We navigate through asteroid fields, dodge rogue solar flares, and face the unknown with a courage born of necessity, bound together by a shared hope for a future beyond the dying embers of Earth.
