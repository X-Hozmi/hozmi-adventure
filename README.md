
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a haphazard collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a surprisingly cheerful executioner, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of dysentery.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, a sense of exhilaration builds – the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in shared adversity, and the intoxicating allure of Constantinople, our distant, glittering goal.  The spices, silks, and whispered rumors carried on the wind are as potent as any potion.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship propelled by a harnessed singularity, leaps between nebulae, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Our crew, a multinational assembly of xeno-linguists, engineers, and bounty hunters, navigates through asteroid fields and encounters with strange, alien lifeforms – some benevolent, some decidedly not. The vastness of the cosmos, both terrifying and breathtaking, demands constant vigilance, yet the potential rewards—discovering new worlds, unlocking ancient secrets—are immeasurable.  The final destination: the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel itself.
