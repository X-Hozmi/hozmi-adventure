
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight.  The scent of thyme and sweat mingled in the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in hushed tones around crackling campfires – of fabled cities hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains, and dragons guarding forgotten treasures.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and discovery; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of famine were constant companions on her perilous journey to Constantinople.  Her quest was a fool's errand, some said, but the lure of the unknown burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riker steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course charted by the erratic signals of a long-lost colony.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space still held an untamed power.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip his ship apart, and pirate broadcasts crackled on the comms, warnings of ruthless scavengers lurking in the shadows of dead stars.  The promise of untold riches and technological marvels lay beyond the nebula, but the journey itself – the confrontation with the unknown, the constant battle against the unforgiving cosmos – was the true adventure.
