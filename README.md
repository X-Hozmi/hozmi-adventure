He’d traded the comforts of court for the thrill of the unknown, seeking the legendary lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril from bandit ambushes to treacherous mountain passes.

Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes glued to the navigational console, expertly steered the vessel through a chaotic ballet of cosmic debris.

The journey was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy, with unknown alien civilizations and technological challenges waiting at every turn.  But the potential discovery outweighed any risk for this intrepid crew.
