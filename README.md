Rumors of a lost city, glittering with gold and ancient magic, fueled his perilous journey.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the wolves, bandits, and unknown terrors lurking in the shadows.  He pressed on, his heart pounding a rhythm against the relentless beat of his horse's hooves, driven by a thirst for glory and the promise of unimaginable riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next giant leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of space pirates tested her skills and nerves to their limits.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant shimmer of countless stars, both awed and intimidated her. Yet, the promise of discovery, the thrill of charting the unknown, kept her hand steady on the controls as she steered her vessel towards the uncharted frontier.
