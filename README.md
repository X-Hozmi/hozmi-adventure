
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth, his armor caked in mud, urged his weary steed onward.  The quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the glint of hope in the eyes of his ailing sister fueled his journey, pushing him ever closer to the fabled city, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and repairing critical systems under the watchful eye of cosmic radiation were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also a terrifying isolation. The weight of her crew's lives, and the fate of a lost civilization, rested on her capable shoulders as she steered them toward the unknown.
