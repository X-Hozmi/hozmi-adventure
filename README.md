
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had been arduous.  Days bled into weeks, marked by sun-scorched trails, skirmishes with brigands, and nights spent huddled around meager fires under a vast, indifferent sky.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering faith of Sir Kaelan, and the unwavering loyalty of Thomas, fueled their relentless progress.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light years.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents was commonplace.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, both inspired awe and instilled a profound sense of isolation. Yet, the weight of her responsibility – the potential to save countless lives – propelled her onward, across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
