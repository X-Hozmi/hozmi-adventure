
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the wind.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any human. Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria's hidden treasures, both material and magical, fueled her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The journey was a tapestry of hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields dodged by a hair's breadth, and the ever-present hum of the ship's engines.  But the allure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries to the edge of the known universe, superseded the risk.  The cosmos, vast and terrifying, yet held the promise of answers and wonders beyond imagining.
