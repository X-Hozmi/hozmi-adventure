
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of illness were less daunting than the promise awaiting her in Constantinople – a rumored cure for her brother's wasting sickness. Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary mile, was a step closer to hope, a testament to the unwavering resolve forged in the face of medieval hardship. The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of a distant city, a potential salvation, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the unmapped galaxy of Andromeda.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced the constant threat of cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the unknown dangers lurking in the vast emptiness between stars.  Unlike the medieval travelers bound by earthly limitations, Ava's quest was for discovery itself – to find new habitable worlds, to expand humanity's reach beyond the familiar confines of its solar system, and to uncover the secrets of a universe brimming with infinite possibilities.
