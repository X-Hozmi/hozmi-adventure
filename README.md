
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of both the beauty and the peril of this journey across a land rife with bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Her survival depended not only on her resilience but also the kindness – or indifference – of strangers along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova"  Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission, far more ambitious than Elara's, was to locate a lost colony on the edge of explored space, rumored to possess technology that could save her dying homeworld.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, pirate incursions a constant threat, and the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space a palpable presence. Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of salvation, and the sheer thrill of charting the unknown propelled her forward, a solitary explorer in a galaxy teeming with wonder and danger.
