Each day was a gamble: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, unpredictable weather turning mountain passes into treacherous death traps, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her party as relentlessly as the sun. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of the lost city of Ys, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope burning brighter than any campfire.  Her journey was not just across miles, but through the very fabric of myth and history.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the crimson nebula, his starship a tiny speck against the swirling cosmic dust.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a prize worth risking the perilous jump through a newly discovered wormhole.  The galaxy held infinite possibilities, but each jump was a lottery, a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas painted with the breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers of the cosmos.
