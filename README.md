
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was far from pleasant.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, the nights were freezing, and the meager rations dwindled with each passing day.  Yet, the lure of Constantinople, whispered promises of exotic silks and forgotten wisdom, pushed her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new opportunity to test her courage and her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. The breathtaking cosmic ballet of colours was a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate was all part of a day's work, but the vast unknown, and the potential rewards of her expedition, spurred her to push the boundaries of human exploration further than ever before.
