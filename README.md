Ahead, the shadowy peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Zerzura.  His pack, heavy with meager supplies and a map more faded than hope, held the weight of his ambition – to find the lost city and the legendary Sunstone rumored to lie within its walls. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on this perilous journey across a continent teetering on the brink of plague.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to be as breathtakingly beautiful as it was dangerously unstable.  With a crew of hardened explorers and a ship equipped for the rigors of interstellar travel, Eva faced not only the treacherous cosmic currents but also the political machinations that threatened to shatter the fragile peace between galactic empires.
