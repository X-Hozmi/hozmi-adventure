
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each creak of her saddle, each strained breath of her horse, was a counterpoint to the rustling whispers of the wind through the parched grasses.  Rumors of a mythical city, lost to time and shrouded in legend, fueled her perilous journey. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the lure of uncovering forgotten history and perhaps, untold riches.  She pressed onward, guided only by a tattered map and an unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony was commonplace;  the real danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  With each jump, the universe stretched and warped around him, a breathtaking and terrifying symphony of light and energy.  The prize, however, was worth the risk: the potential to unlock the secrets of the cosmos and usher in a new era of galactic exploration.
