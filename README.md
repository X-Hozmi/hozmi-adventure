
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track as I traversed the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each breath was a gasp against the thin air, the biting wind a constant companion.  My meager supplies – dried meat, hardtack, and a flask of watered-down wine – felt precious as I navigated treacherous ravines and skirted around suspicious-looking settlements.  Rumors of bandits and worse haunted the trail, fueling the nervous energy that crackled beneath my weary bones. This journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage for a lost relic, was a test of endurance, a constant dance between hope and despair.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Navigating the Xylos nebula was a challenge even for Captain Eva Rostova’s seasoned crew; unpredictable asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of Kryll pirates kept us on edge.  Yet, the thrill of charting unmapped star systems, the wonder of discovering new planets with alien flora and fauna, far outweighed the risks.  The mission to locate the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered to be hidden on a planet orbiting a distant pulsar, was a quest not just for scientific discovery, but for the chance to rewrite history itself.
