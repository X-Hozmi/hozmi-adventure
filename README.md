
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mire.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier on her journey to the mythical Sunken City.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge fueled her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each labored breath of her horse, marked another step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil.  The jump to Xylos had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints. Now, they were on the edge of uncharted territory,  a galaxy teeming with alien life and untold wonders – and dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew.  The vastness of space held limitless opportunities, but with every jump to a new star system came the thrilling uncertainty of what awaited them on the other side.
