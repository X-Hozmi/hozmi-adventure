
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the biting wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through a forest thick with shadows and whispers of banditry.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Jude.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this unforgiving land.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship – hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, the allure of the sacred texts, and the thrill of the unknown, propelled him forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking silence of interstellar space.  Unlike the medieval knight, Eva faced a different kind of hardship; the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, and the loneliness of deep space. Yet, the promise of discovery, of forging a new path for humanity among the stars, fueled her unwavering determination.
