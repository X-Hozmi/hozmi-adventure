
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind whipping at her cloak.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows, the terrain is unforgiving, and hunger gnaws at her belly.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to etch her name into the annals of history, pushes her onward, each arduous step a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of distant suns is child's play for a seasoned veteran like Ryla, but the unknown always holds a thrilling edge.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet capable of sustaining human life beyond Earth. The vastness of space, peppered with wonders and dangers unseen, represents a frontier as limitless and perilous as any medieval map.
