
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and a grizzled mercenary named Bjorn trudged through the mud, the relentless rain a constant companion on their journey from York to the Holy Land.  Their pilgrimage was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager provisions in squalid villages.  Yet, the allure of Jerusalem, the whispered promises of divine grace, and the camaraderie forged in shared hardship spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hyperspace travel.  While the dangers were different – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the threat of pirate raiders, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms – the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and inspiring, a canvas upon which the human thirst for exploration painted its boldest strokes.
