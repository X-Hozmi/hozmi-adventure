
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager provisions in impoverished villages.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, her resolve hardened, fuelled by a sister's unwavering love.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, a constant dance with the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  But the true danger lay not in cosmic phenomena, but in the unknown, the potential for encountering alien life – both benevolent and hostile – during her perilous voyage across the galaxy.
