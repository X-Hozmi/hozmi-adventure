
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, fuels our weary steps.  The journey is arduous, but the promise of untold riches and exotic wonders keeps our spirits aloft, even as the dust settles on our dreams.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy fields, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, seeking habitable planets amidst the swirling cosmic dust.  The dangers are different now – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling emptiness of space itself. But the thirst for discovery, the insatiable human need to explore the unknown, remains unchanged.  The galaxy awaits.
