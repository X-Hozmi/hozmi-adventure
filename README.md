
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castilla.  Her worn leather satchel held a map, more hope than directions, guiding her towards the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving landscape itself.  Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, a fierce determination etched on her face.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a sentient crystalline lifeform.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the real adventure lay in the discovery.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of untold wonders – and equally perilous unknowns – challenging Ryla's courage and skill at every turn.
