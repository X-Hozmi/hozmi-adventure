
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was a brutal test of endurance; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the relentless sun beat down upon their weary bodies.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger, both human and natural.  Their quest, a desperate search for a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland, fueled their every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates were commonplace hazards, overshadowed only by the daunting vastness of space itself.  The hum of the ship's engines and the starlight painting the cockpit were her constant companions, a stark contrast to the medieval hardships yet sharing a common thread: the unwavering courage and determination needed to overcome immense odds in the pursuit of a vital goal.
