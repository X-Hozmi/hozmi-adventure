
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions, and her heart held a greater burden – the quest to find her brother, lost amidst the chaos of the Hundred Years' War.  Every creaking wagon wheel, every barking dog, held the faint possibility of a lead, a glimmer of hope in the harsh reality of medieval travel; a journey fraught with bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating through asteroid fields and negotiating with space pirates were merely inconveniences compared to the political minefield awaiting her on the planet's surface.  Unlike the medieval traveler, she had faster-than-light travel, advanced technology, and a crew at her back, but the perils of exploration remained – the unknown, the unpredictable, and the ever-present risk of failure.
