
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags as my trusty mare, Bess, picks her way across the parched earth.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a formidable barrier on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors whisper of untold riches and ancient magic, but the reality is far harsher – bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are my constant companions. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a fresh test of my courage and resilience, forging me into something stronger than I ever thought possible.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  My ship, the *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy fields, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae are breathtaking, alien suns paint the cosmos in vibrant hues, and the silence is profound, broken only by the hum of the hyperdrive.  My mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking out new worlds and new life.  The dangers are different now – cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of alien civilizations – but the thrill of discovery, the relentless push into the unknown, remains the same timeless human drive.
