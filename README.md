
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of shimmering silks and exotic spices in the distant city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the mule's harness, each rustle of the nearby forest, held the promise – or threat – of adventure. Bandits, storms, and the endless, unforgiving landscape were his constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown kept him pressing on, a lone figure against the vast backdrop of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Elara's ears, a comforting counterpoint to the immensity of space visible through her viewport.  Nebulae painted the blackness with vibrant strokes, galaxies spiralled into unimaginable distances.  Her mission: to chart the newly-discovered Kepler-186f system, a planet promising the potential for life beyond Earth.  The vastness of the journey, the unpredictable nature of alien environments, and the ever-present risk of malfunctioning technology were daunting, but Elara, a seasoned astrogator, embraced the challenge.  The stars were her canvas, and exploration, her destiny.
