
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, pressed onward.  Each creak of his saddle was a symphony of uncertainty, the vastness of the European countryside stretching before him like a green and brown ocean.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, whispered about in hushed tones in smoky taverns, yet the allure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, brimming with ancient treasures and untold knowledge, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving terrain.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance and will, each sunrise a new challenge against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  the cold, unyielding darkness punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the occasional flash of a rogue asteroid.  While the dangers differed from Thomas's medieval trek—cosmic radiation, hostile alien life, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps—the underlying spirit of adventure, the thrill of exploration in the face of overwhelming odds, remained the same, a constant hum beneath the roar of the ship's engines.
