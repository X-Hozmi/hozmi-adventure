
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered tales of bandits and wild beasts.  Her quest, to reach the legendary monastery of Saint-Gilles and deliver a vital message, was fraught with peril, every step a gamble against the elements and the unpredictable nature of man.  The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the landscape into a shimmering haze, yet Elara pressed on, spurred by the urgency of her mission.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His journey, far from the dusty trails of medieval Europe, spanned light-years, each jump a calculated risk across treacherous wormholes.  The vastness of space, a cold and unforgiving expanse, held its own set of dangers – pirate fleets, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies. Yet, the lure of the uncharted galaxy, the promise of untold riches and knowledge, fueled his relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
