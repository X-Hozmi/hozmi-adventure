
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, had already claimed several pack animals and tested their resolve against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by whispered legends of untold riches and a lost civilization, a powerful counterpoint to the gnawing pangs of hunger and the aching muscles protesting their relentless pace.  They rode through forests haunted by whispered folklore and across sun-baked plains, their faith in the legend—and in each other—their only compass.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highway. Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily hazard, but the lure of unlocking the universe's secrets was an irresistible force. Her crew, a diverse band of explorers bound by a shared thirst for discovery, faced down cosmic storms and alien encounters with unwavering courage, their journey a testament to human ingenuity and the boundless ambition that propels us to reach for the stars.
