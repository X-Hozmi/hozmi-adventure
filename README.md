
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a cryptic map, promising untold riches hidden in a forgotten monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the Inquisition.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, a flicker of hope brighter than the dying embers of the day.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, leaving a shimmering trail in its wake.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Zydonian cruisers was all in a day's work, but the true challenge lay in the uncharted territories beyond known space.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but equally countless dangers – each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each new planet a potential tomb.
