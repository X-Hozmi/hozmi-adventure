
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking bridge, each whispering forest, each wary villager encountered, presents a fresh challenge, testing her courage and resourcefulness.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey across the heart of Europe.  Her hope, however, burns brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets is routine, yet the thrill of exploration never fades.  Her mission: to chart unmapped regions of Andromeda, seeking new habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  The alien landscapes, teeming with bizarre flora and fauna, both beautiful and terrifying, offer a constant source of wonder and danger.  The loneliness of space, punctuated only by the hum of the ship and the crackle of comms, is a different kind of hardship than Elara faced, but the drive to push boundaries and discover the unknown unites them both.
