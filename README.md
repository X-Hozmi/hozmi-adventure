
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes guarded by elements as unforgiving as any foe, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  Yet, with each sunset, the thrill of discovery burns brighter. We trade stories around crackling fires, sharing tales of exotic cities, lost kingdoms whispered of in hushed tones, and the siren call of the unknown, propelling us ever onward.  The journey is arduous, but the reward is the world itself.


Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the light of distant quasars, her crew a diverse band united by a thirst for exploration beyond human comprehension.  Each jump through hyperspace brings them closer to the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel and the secrets of ancient civilizations that predate humankind. The dangers are different now – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unforeseen alien encounters. But the spirit of adventure, that primal urge to push beyond the boundaries of the known, remains unchanged.
