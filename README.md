
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  He'd traded his meager possessions for a worn map and the blessing of a hermit, relying on the kindness of strangers and the strength of his own resolve against the daunting expanse of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of uncharted celestial bodies, she relied on advanced technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vastness of space, though breathtaking, was a constant threat, every jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving reality of the cosmos.
