
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered squire led their weary horses across the sun-baked plains.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the King across the treacherous Serpent's Tooth mountains, had tested their endurance beyond measure. Bandit raids, treacherous river crossings, and the constant threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the ever-present fear of the Whispering Plague that stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought a renewed hope for survival, a flicker of defiance against the grim reality of their journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent algae from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, yet the vastness of space still held its own terrors.  Navigation glitches, pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems demanded constant vigilance, making each jump through hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
