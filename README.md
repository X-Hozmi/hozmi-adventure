
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, a knight errant, spurred his destrier across the muddy track, the chill wind whipping at his surcoat.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, fueled his weary body and determined spirit, driving him onward through the sprawling, untamed landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a perilous diplomatic journey across the Andromeda Galaxy, carrying a vital peace treaty between warring alien empires. Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and pirate attacks a constant threat.  But the fate of countless civilizations rested on her shoulders, and the vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos fueled her resolve to complete her interstellar voyage, no matter the cost.
