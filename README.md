
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke mingling with the ever-present tang of sweat and fear.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the harsh terrain tested both beast and rider.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant gamble against starvation, dehydration, and the unknown horrors that lay beyond the next dune. Yet, the promise of discovery, of uncovering ancient secrets, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starlight" Jax navigated the nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Seraphina*.  The kaleidoscopic beauty of the cosmic dust clouds masked a treacherous path through asteroid fields and uncharted gravitational anomalies.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, a faint whisper across the vast gulf of interstellar space.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital resource hidden on a remote planet, a resource that held the key to galactic peace or utter annihilation. The weight of the galaxy rested on her shoulders, each hyperspace jump a leap of faith into the unpredictable wonders and dangers of the cosmos.
