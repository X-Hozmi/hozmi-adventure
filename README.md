
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Survival itself was a victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror.  Unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure were the constant challenges of her interstellar voyage.  The discovery of a new world, however, promised a future far brighter than the dying one she had left behind.
