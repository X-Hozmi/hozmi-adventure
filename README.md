
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and the map – a crude thing, promising a legendary lost city rumored to hold untold riches.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harsh realities of starvation.  Her adventure was a gamble, a desperate hope against the backdrop of a world steeped in superstition and peril.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a song of controlled chaos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to possess breathable air and untapped resources.  But the journey across the galaxy was fraught with its own dangers.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system failures could end their mission in an instant.  The vastness of space offered a breathtaking beauty, but it was a beauty that hid perils far more terrifying than any medieval bandit.
