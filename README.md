
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, spurred his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the Ardennes forest, offered little comfort.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys rumored to hold a lost relic of immense power, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the forest itself seemed to conspire against him with tangled undergrowth and treacherous bogs, and the gnawing hunger in his belly was a constant companion to the fear in his heart. Each sunrise brought a renewed determination, each sunset a renewed prayer for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to possess ancient alien technology.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was commonplace; the true challenge lay in deciphering the complex gravitational currents within the nebula.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the immense distances and the even more immense risks involved in her expedition.  The fate of humanity, or so she believed, hung in the balance.
