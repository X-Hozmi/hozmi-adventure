
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a vengeful lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill and terror of the unknown.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions on this perilous journey to the rumored fertile lands beyond the Loire.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The crimson gas clouds painted the cockpit in an ethereal glow as he navigated the treacherous asteroid field, his course charted to the far-off galaxy of Andromeda, a pilgrimage for a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on his home planet.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, a comforting rhythm in the vast, silent expanse of space, punctuated only by the crackle of comms and the occasional warning chime from the ship's AI.  The adventure was not just in the destination, but in the perilous journey itself.
