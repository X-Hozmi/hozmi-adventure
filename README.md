
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  He’d traded his meager inheritance for a mule-train heading east, a fool's errand some called it, seeking the legendary City of Zerzura whispered to lie beyond the burning sands.  Each creak of his saddle, each rise and fall of the landscape, fueled the burning hope that he, unlike countless others, would uncover its secrets –  a wealth of spices, perhaps, or something far more wondrous. The journey was fraught with peril: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the desert itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, a test of both her ship's resilience and her own.  Beyond the breathtaking cosmic vistas lay the unknown; hostile alien life, treacherous gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of a malfunction that could strand them in the infinite void.  But the lure of discovery, of charting the uncharted, propelled her onward.
