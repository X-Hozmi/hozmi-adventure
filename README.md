
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and dried meats.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death were less daunting than the thrill of her journey.  She was bound for Constantinople, a legendary city shimmering on the horizon of her ambition, to seek knowledge from the ancient libraries and perhaps, even a cure for the plague ravaging her village. Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, the unknown a siren's call luring her ever onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for hyperspace jumps. Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable worlds for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held the same allure of the unknown that had drawn Elara centuries before – a boundless expanse promising untold riches, both scientific and spiritual, for those daring enough to explore.
