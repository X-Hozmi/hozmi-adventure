The rough track wound through a forest haunted by whispers of goblins and worse, the destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a dragon's hoard and secrets older than the kingdom itself.

The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, every jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving cosmos, but the hope of finding survivors spurred her on.
