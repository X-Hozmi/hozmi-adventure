
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek the Pope's pardon for her exiled brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested her resilience. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, every campfire a brief respite before facing the unforgiving vastness of the medieval world.  The whisper of rumors, the clash of distant steel, and the kindness of strangers were the constant companions on her arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut a swathe through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the encroaching void decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable wormhole currents, Ryla and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space.  The cold vacuum of space, the loneliness of interstellar travel, and the constant threat of unknown anomalies were their daily realities.  Yet, the promise of discovery and the hope of finding the lost colonists fueled their intrepid voyage across the galaxy.
