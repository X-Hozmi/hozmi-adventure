Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of forgotten magic, a destination many had sought and few had found.

But the promise of discovering new worlds, of adding another star to the Galactic Federation's map, spurred them onward, a modern quest echoing the spirit of ancient explorers.
