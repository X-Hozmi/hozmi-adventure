
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Days bled into weeks of muddy tracks, meager rations, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and bartering for shelter in unfamiliar villages, their medieval world a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty.  Yet, the lure of the sacred city, and the adventure itself, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the cosmic distances were still daunting.  Weeks stretched into months as Eva battled solar flares, navigated asteroid fields, and repaired the ship's ailing hyperdrive, all while battling the loneliness of deep space and the constant hum of the ship's engines.  The future held immense promise, but the journey to secure it was as perilous and demanding as any medieval pilgrimage.
