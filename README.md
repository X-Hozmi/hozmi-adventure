
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, the promise of discovery outweighing the risks a thousandfold.  She was a tiny speck against the vastness of the medieval world, chasing a whisper of hope across a tapestry of dirt roads and ancient forests.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a galaxy far beyond human exploration.  The risks were colossal; unknown gravitational forces, potential encounters with hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of system failure hung heavy in the air.  But the allure of the infinite, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, spurred her on.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the vast, indifferent expanse of the universe.
