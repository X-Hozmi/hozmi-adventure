
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a punctuation mark in her perilous journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the unwavering desire for a cure fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of colors swirling around her vessel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work for Eva. Yet, the vastness of space, the profound solitude, and the constant threat of cosmic anomalies held a different kind of danger—one far more isolating and awe-inspiring than any medieval bandit could ever conjure.
