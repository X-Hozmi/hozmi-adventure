
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst her people, said to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged their village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her fear and her unwavering determination.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself – but the hope of salvation propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold a rare mineral capable of powering faster-than-light travel. The journey was less perilous in terms of physical threats, but the cosmic expanse presented different challenges.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, and the constant threat of engine failure – each was a test of skill and nerve.  The rewards, however, were potentially limitless.
