
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate flight from bandits and a relentless summer drought.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential danger – a constant companion on the unforgiving medieval roads.  The promised sanctuary of the cathedral felt a lifetime away, a distant beacon in the vast, perilous wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a silent path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and intergalactic rivalries that threatened her expedition. The vast emptiness of space held both limitless possibility and terrifying unknowns, a cosmic mirror to the dangers Elara faced on her earthly pilgrimage.
