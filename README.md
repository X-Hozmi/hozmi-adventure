
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, dense forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's golden spires in their dreams spurred them onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of their medieval journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The dangers were different now – volatile asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, navigated the cosmos with steely resolve, guided by the faint signal emanating from the distant colony, a lifeline in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.
