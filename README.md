
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fuelled by whispers of lost glory and the promise of adventure far beyond their wildest dreams.  The road stretched ahead, a tapestry woven with peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of metal against the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating through asteroid fields and treacherous nebulae, she and her crew faced dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's – cosmic radiation, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover the fate of a lost civilization, spurred them on through the vast emptiness, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each star a potential beacon of hope or despair.
