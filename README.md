
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The shimmering heat haze rising from the dusty track distorted the already distant spires of Camelot.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen Orb of Aethelred – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and into the shadowy embrace of the Whispering Woods, where goblin ambushes were as common as the gnarled oaks. Every mile was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease, but the glory awaiting him – and the king's gratitude – fuelled his unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Navigating the cosmic currents and deciphering ancient star charts proved a more challenging test than any terrestrial battle, but the promise of finding her people, lost amongst the stars, burned brighter than any supernova.
