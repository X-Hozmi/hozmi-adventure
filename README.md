
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He was bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the travelers, and the very landscape – treacherous mountains and unforgiving deserts – posed constant threats. Yet, the whispers of Samarkand's riches, its silks and spices, fueled his weary legs and spurred him across the vast, uncharted expanse of the medieval world, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a hard-won victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was not measured in days or weeks, but in subjective time warped by relativistic speeds and punctuated by the quiet hum of the Alcubierre drive.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Thomas's medieval trek, Eva faced the chilling vastness of space, the ever-present threat of stellar anomalies and equipment failure, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The allure of discovery, however, burned as brightly within her as it had in Thomas's heart, centuries ago.
