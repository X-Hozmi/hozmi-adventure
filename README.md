
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, wound ever deeper, promising both peril and the rumored riches of a forgotten monastery.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the flickering torchlight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the anticipation – and the fear – of what lay ahead in this untamed wilderness.  His quest for the lost relic was a gamble with life itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold scientific discoveries – and possibly, deadly alien life.  Navigation was a delicate dance between celestial bodies, each jump a calculated risk amidst the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue solar flares.  The vast emptiness of space was both exhilarating and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense scale of the universe they traversed.  The reward for her bravery?  Unknowable, but worth the journey.
