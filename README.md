
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried berries and a chipped map, but her heart swelled with the thrill of her journey.  She was bound for the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to lie beyond the Whispering Sands, a place of untold riches and powerful magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of both danger and discovery, a potent cocktail that fueled her solitary quest.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold sentient life.  The vastness of space, peppered with the glittering dust of a million dying stars, was a constant reminder of both the peril and the profound beauty of her mission.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the relentless hum of the hyperdrive were all just part of a day's work for a seasoned spacefarer like Ryla; the quest for the unknown, the relentless pull of the cosmos, was her only true compass.
