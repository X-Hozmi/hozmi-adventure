
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under a bruised sky, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Black Forest, snaked towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine, not from the cold, but the whispered tales of goblins and wilder things that lurked in the shadows.  His quest, a desperate search for a cure for the plague ravaging his village, pushed him ever forward, facing down treacherous terrain and the ever-present threat of bandits and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving emptiness between worlds.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on unsuspecting explorers traversing the galaxy’s perilous arteries. The search for a new home, a new beginning, was a journey far more dangerous than any medieval knight could ever imagine.
