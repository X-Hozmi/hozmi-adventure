
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched his worn map, its parchment brittle with age, depicting a route whispered to hold the legendary Sunstone. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms, each day a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold scientific discoveries and potential for colonization.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the occasional meteor shower, was far removed from the dangers of Thomas's journey, yet just as unforgiving.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure made each jump between star systems a perilous, but thrilling, adventure.
