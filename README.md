
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland – pushed him relentlessly forward.  Each rustling bush, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, hinted at the dangers lurking in the wilderness: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His journey was a constant battle against the elements and the unknown, a test of both his physical and mental endurance.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, a sleek starship capable of faster-than-light travel, towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate humanity clinging to survival on a dying Earth.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate incursions were mere inconveniences compared to the vastness of space itself.  The loneliness, the immense distances, and the constant risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms were far greater challenges than any medieval knight could ever imagine facing.  Yet, the hope of a new beginning fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
