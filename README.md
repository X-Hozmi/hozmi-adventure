
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her homespun tunic. Her journey to the fabled city of Alexandria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and whispers of a plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, from negotiating with surly innkeepers to outsmarting thieving merchants, all while clinging to the hope of finding the rare herbs her ailing brother desperately needed.  Her adventure wasn't just a journey across a map, but a voyage through the heart of a volatile and unpredictable world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull shimmering under the cold light of a binary sunset.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and filled with the unknown.  Instead of bandits, she faced the unpredictable currents of nebulae and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  Ancient alien ruins, whispered to hold keys to faster-than-light travel, were her Alexandria, a tantalizing prize balanced against the crushing pressure of space and the loneliness of interstellar travel.  Her crew, her ship, her courage – these were her allies in a vast, unforgiving cosmos.
