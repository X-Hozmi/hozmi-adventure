
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the harsh landscape of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a testament to countless ripped edges and hastily added notes, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the secret to a potent healing herb. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were minor inconveniences compared to the potential reward – the life of her younger brother hung in the balance. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the perilous beauty of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms as he navigated the treacherous asteroid fields and avoided the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll Hegemony.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, dwarfed even the most ambitious terrestrial adventures, a testament to humanity's enduring quest for discovery beyond the confines of its cradle.
