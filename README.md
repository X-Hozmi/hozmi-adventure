
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his weary steed onward.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the hope it represented, pushed him relentlessly across the unforgiving terrain, a single knight against the vast, unpredictable medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump gates hummed, spitting her vessel into alien star systems teeming with wonders and dangers.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadows, and uncharted cosmic storms threatened to obliterate her ship.  But the weight of responsibility for the colonists, the potential for a new beginning amongst the stars, fueled her courage.  Across the vast, star-strewn canvas of the galaxy, she charted a course towards hope.
