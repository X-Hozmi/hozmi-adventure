
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, creaked across the dusty plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, the gnawing uncertainty of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present discomfort of the unforgiving terrain.  Yet, with every league covered, the allure of exotic spices, shimmering silks, and whispered tales of ancient wonders fueled our onward journey, defying the hardships and embracing the unknown. The thrill of discovery was worth more than gold, and the camaraderie forged in shared adversity became a treasure in itself.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our pathways.  The Althea, a generation ship cutting through the inky void, carried us towards Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  While the journey was measured in decades, not days, the challenges were different, but no less profound.  We faced the constant threat of equipment malfunction, the psychological strain of confinement, and the terrifying vastness of space itself.  But the dream of a new home, a world waiting to be explored and shaped, kept our spirits high, a beacon in the endless darkness.
