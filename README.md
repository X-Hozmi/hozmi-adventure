
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rutted track barely discernible beneath the mud.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of our tired horses was a symphony of the journey, a testament to the miles already conquered and those yet to come.  We sought the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones – a mirage, perhaps, or a city of gold, a gamble worth the perils of bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. The lure of the unknown propelled us forward, despite the aching bones and dwindling supplies.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our guide.  The sleek, crimson hull of the *Stardust Wanderer* cut through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey spanned light years, each warp jump a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies and pirate raids.  But the potential reward, the unlocking of interstellar travel, was a siren song too powerful to resist, drawing us across the gulf of space despite the dangers that lurked in the void between stars.
