
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Castile, a worn map clutched in her gloved hand. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Zaragossa, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils she faced.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, her determination as unwavering as the medieval sun beating down on her.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Kryll civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the ruthless Solarian Syndicate, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day’s work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space held both immense danger and unimaginable wonders, making every interstellar voyage a gamble with fate itself.
