
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses’ hooves kicking up clouds of ochre.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Their quest, to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones, demanded unwavering courage and a faith stronger than any steel.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the horizon, making the journey as much a test of endurance as a search for the mythical.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, fraught with unknown gravitational forces and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of the Kryll crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, fueled her daring expedition. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a different kind of peril – the cold, uncaring indifference of the cosmos itself.
