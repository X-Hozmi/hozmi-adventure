
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage of both faith and desperation, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a prayer of survival as she navigated the treacherous tapestry of medieval Europe, relying on the kindness of strangers and the resilience of her own spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the potential for discovery balanced precariously against the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the unknown horrors that lurked beyond the reach of human understanding.
