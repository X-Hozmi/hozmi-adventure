
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of Zerzura spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to the perilous journey.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigation relied on antiquated star charts and instinct, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the mission's inherent dangers.  Alien encounters, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of system failure were merely obstacles in Ryla's determined pursuit of a forgotten people.
