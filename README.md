
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both horse and rider, and the ever-present threat of sickness hung heavy in the air. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each village encountered a new story, each hardship overcome a testament to her resilience. The journey itself was the adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship, kindness, and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle, but navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace demanded constant vigilance.  Asteroid fields posed a constant threat, and the potential for encountering hostile alien lifeforms added a layer of thrilling unpredictability.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic wonders, held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, but the promise of discovery spurred her onward.
