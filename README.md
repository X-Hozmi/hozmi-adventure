
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin chafed, a small price to pay for the adventure.  Rumors of a lost monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, had lured her from her village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any flickering torchlight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a kaleidoscope of colors and cosmic wonders, both terrified and exhilarated her.  Facing down asteroid fields, navigating treacherous wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were all part of the job – a far cry from her simple life on Earth, but the promise of discovery and the allure of charting unmapped territories kept her engine roaring towards the unknown.
