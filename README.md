
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map – a hastily drawn sketch of a rumored hidden monastery said to contain ancient wisdom.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey, each hardship forging her resolve to reach her destination.  The thrill of the unknown, of pushing beyond the familiar boundaries of her village, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world lightyears from Earth.  The vastness of space, the shimmering beauty of celestial wonders, and the constant hum of the ship's engines were a far cry from the medieval plains, yet the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The unknown dangers were different – radiation storms, hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the drive to explore, to discover, burned as brightly in her heart as it had in Elara's.
