
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Provence, a worn map clutched in her hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Serinor, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her arduous journey.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers, but also the hope of finally reaching her destination, a hope fuelled by the unwavering love for her sibling.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: a daring expedition to a newly discovered planet, Xylos, whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and facing the unknown terrors of alien landscapes are all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew. The vast emptiness of space holds both immense peril and unimaginable reward, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of discovery.
