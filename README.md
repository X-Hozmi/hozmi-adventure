
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of  Seraphina, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume him before he reached his destination.  He relied on the kindness of strangers, the resilience of his horse, and the unwavering hope that fueled his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unknown celestial phenomena and potentially hostile alien civilizations.   Advanced technology mitigated some of the hardships, but the vastness of space and the ever-present risk of equipment failure instilled a constant sense of peril.  Her courage, and the unwavering loyalty of her crew, were her most vital resources.
