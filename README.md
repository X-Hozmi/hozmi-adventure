
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, ride towards the distant, snow-capped peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Their quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael, rumored to be hidden within a forgotten monastery nestled high amongst the treacherous cliffs.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing hunger of the wilderness – but the lure of glory and the promise of the saint's sacred power fuels their relentless journey eastward.  The very air vibrates with the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate patrols in uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy is a daily struggle.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, presents a constant reminder of the sheer scale of their undertaking. The potential rewards, however, outweigh any danger, promising a future where interstellar travel is commonplace.
