
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the unwavering hope of reunion fueled her onward, each mile a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape and the gnawing uncertainties of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope's Embrace*, lost somewhere amongst the uncharted star systems beyond the Galactic Rim.  Facing cosmic storms, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from any known civilization, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering determination to navigate the treacherous expanse of space, the vastness of the cosmos mirroring the boundless human spirit’s quest for discovery.
