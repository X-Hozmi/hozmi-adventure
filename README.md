
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present specter of disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of glory, pushed him relentlessly across the treacherous landscape, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a nebula of swirling crimson and gold.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, awe-inspiring emptiness of space.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the threat of pirate attacks from rival corporations, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps all posed significant perils, but the promise of discovering a new home for humanity fueled her and her crew on their perilous, interstellar voyage.
