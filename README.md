
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and fear thick in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each wary glance from a passing knight, fueled the adventure, a relentless push against the backdrop of war and uncertainty.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and the rumors of monstrous beasts in the nearby forests kept her ever vigilant, a constant hum of danger underscoring the hope in her heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was a daily routine, the vast, inky blackness both terrifying and exhilarating.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, a constant reminder of the perilous distance, but the promise of unlocking interstellar travel spurred her onward, fueled by the weight of human exploration and the irresistible allure of the unknown.
