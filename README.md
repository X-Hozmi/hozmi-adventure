
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her and her small band of travelers.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. The journey had been arduous, fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the knowledge that the road ahead remained long and unforgiving.  Their survival depended on their wits, their courage, and the unwavering bond forged in shared hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate incursions was a daily challenge, the vastness of space a constant reminder of their isolation.  But the promise of unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel fueled her and her crew, pushing them onwards despite the immense distances and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown dangers lurking in the cosmic void.
