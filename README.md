
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey across the breadth of France.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – fear of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests, fear of the unpredictable weather, and a deep, gnawing fear of the unknown that lay beyond the next crest of the hill.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: treacherous river crossings, desolate plains baking under the summer sun, and the constant negotiation with suspicious lords and their even more suspicious retainers.  My quest, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine, felt as vast and unending as the road itself.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the Andromeda galaxy.  The starfields, a kaleidoscope of unimaginable colours, stretched before me, a tapestry woven by dying suns and nascent nebulae.  Instead of bandits, we faced the perils of cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormhole currents.  Instead of muddy tracks, the Althea navigated asteroid fields and uncharted systems. My mission, the search for a lost colony, dwarfed even the medieval pilgrimage in its scope, a gamble against the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  But like those medieval travelers, the thrill of the unknown fuelled me onward.
