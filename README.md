
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and hopeful speculation, was her only guide to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold riches and the healing balm for her ailing brother.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the sting of sun and the bite of hunger, yet the unwavering glint of Eldoria's fabled treasures fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system was risky, the wormhole unstable, but the promise of a new colony, a chance to escape the suffocating political climate of Earth, outweighed the danger.  Through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, she steered her ship, her crew a band of brave souls united by a shared dream of a new dawn, a new world waiting to be explored, its secrets whispering from the stars.
