
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack mules and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the scrub, whispers of bandits, desert storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and untold secrets, propels us onward, fuelled by hope and a desperate thirst for adventure.  We are bound together by a shared dream, a common purpose in the face of an unforgiving landscape.


A thousand years hence, the stars are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar travel, cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a humanity stretched thin on its cradle world.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  We face the chilling emptiness of space, the unpredictable whims of alien lifeforms, and the ever-present danger of technological failure.  Yet, the vastness of the cosmos, its promise of discovery and the potential for a new beginning, fuels our courage. We are explorers charting the destiny of mankind among the stars.
