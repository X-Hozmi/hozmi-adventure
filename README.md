
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains as Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully in the weak sun, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey – a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude – had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested their mettle.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar rivers to bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies.  The legendary shrine felt as distant and unattainable as the stars themselves.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, hurtling through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems under the threat of hull breaches were all in a day's work.  The vast expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human exploration to the very limits of reality.
