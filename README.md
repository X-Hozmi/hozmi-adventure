
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind the creaking wheels of our wagon, a tiny speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty; the stark, windswept plains giving way to sun-drenched vineyards, and the hushed awe of ancient cathedrals punctuating the endless miles.  Every cracked cobblestone, every shared campfire, was a memory forged in the crucible of adventure.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our roads.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we leaped across the void between galaxies, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  We weren't bound by the limitations of land or sea; our destination, a nebula teeming with unexplored planets, beckoned with its siren song of the unknown.  The thrill of discovering sentient lifeforms unlike any we'd encountered before, and the breathtaking vistas of nebulas painted across the cosmos, far outweighed the risks inherent in traversing the galaxy’s treacherous highways.
