
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary mare across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promise both peril and passage to the fabled Silk Road.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandit ambush or monstrous beast.  Her quest for the legendary Sunstone, a gem said to hold the power of a thousand suns, fuels her onward, despite the relentless heat and the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through asteroid fields and cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vast expanse of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, stretches before her, a canvas of swirling colours and hidden dangers.  Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the truth behind the colony's disappearance, propels her forward across the endless gulf between the stars.
