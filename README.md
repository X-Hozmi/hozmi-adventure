
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and meager supplies.  The whispers of Moorish bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her quest to reach the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, sent a shiver down her spine, a stark contrast to the burning sun on her back.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with fear and hope, a relentless push against the unforgiving landscape and the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of swirling gas and distant galaxies.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, was fraught with peril; unpredictable spatial currents and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every light-year a gamble.  Yet, the promise of new life, of charting unmapped territories across the cosmos, fuelled her ambition, eclipsing the daunting vastness of space and the uncertainties that lay ahead.
