
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Elara, had tested their endurance beyond measure.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless rhythm of hooves on dirt roads, the gnawing hunger of their bellies, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests. Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and sharing meager rations with weary horses.  Yet, the unwavering faith fueling their quest propelled them onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across uncharted star systems.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were commonplace.  The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval world's dense forests, presented a different kind of challenge – the loneliness of interstellar travel, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the ever-present fear of the unknown lurking beyond the reach of known space.
