
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara's caravan lumbered onward, its creaking wheels a counterpoint to the rhythmic clop of horses' hooves.  Their destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril, but also the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, a potent brew fueling their arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps were risky, each one a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  Beyond the technical challenges, the loneliness of interstellar travel was a formidable foe, the vast emptiness a stark contrast to the vibrant, bustling ports of Earth. Yet, the thought of reaching Kepler and assisting the colonists spurred him on, a beacon in the endless night.
