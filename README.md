
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the far more terrifying unknown. The journey was a constant battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the gnawing fear that Ys was nothing more than a fanciful legend.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, cut a lonely path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission, far grander than Elara's, was to locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast distances, the potential for encountering hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning hyperdrives made this a journey far more technologically advanced, but no less perilous than Elara's medieval trek.  The weight of billions rested on Ryla's shoulders, a responsibility far heavier than any plague.
