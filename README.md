
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the worn letters entrusted to her – a desperate plea from a family separated by the Hundred Years' War.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the tall grasses, held the potential for danger; bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of war shadowed her journey.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart, fueled by the stories of chivalry and courage, kept her pushing forward, towards an uncertain but vital destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the journey was far from smooth; treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each hyperspace jump a gamble.  Yet, Ryla, a seasoned explorer hardened by years spent charting the unknown, held firm.  The weight of galactic destiny rested on her shoulders, a burden she carried with the unwavering determination of a pioneer forging a new path amongst the stars.
