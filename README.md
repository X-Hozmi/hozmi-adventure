
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Jude, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in the shadows,  hostile villagers wary of strangers, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the jeweled cross, envisioned in his mind's eye, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across disparate star systems after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of binary suns were merely the mundane hazards of interstellar travel.  The true danger lay in the unknown – alien lifeforms, derelict spaceships harboring deadly secrets, and the ever-present threat of system collapse.  But the hope of finding the lost colonists spurred Elara onward, across the vast, breathtaking expanse of the galaxy.
