
The year is 1347.  Our band of travelers, a motley crew of knights, scholars, and a suspiciously nimble thief, pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted road.  The sun beat down mercilessly as they traversed the unforgiving landscape, the whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Forest a constant threat. Each sun-drenched valley and rain-swollen river represented a challenge, a test of their endurance and camaraderie. Their quest? The legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the ailing king.  The journey, however, promised to be far more perilous than the prize itself.


Millennia later, the stars themselves were the road.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her crew a diverse team of xeno-linguists and seasoned navigators. Their mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets capable of sustaining humanity's expanding population.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the vibrant colours of distant stellar nurseries and the cold, dark expanse between galaxies, held both wonder and peril.  Wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble – a thrilling, exhilarating leap into the unknown.
