
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the gnawing anxiety in his gut.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the dangers of bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, pushing him further into the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through a nebula of iridescent gas, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less perilous.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields, the constant threat of engine failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space, and the ever-present unknown of alien encounters tested her crew's courage and skill to their limits.
