
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a dried sausage, and a map more faded than hope.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse—the dreaded Black Death, whispering its insidious promise on the wind.  Yet, the glint of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, nestled somewhere beyond these mountains, fuelled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was a gamble, a desperate search for a habitable world amidst the ever-expanding void.  While the dangers of space were different—cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders—the thrill of discovery echoed Elara's journey.  The unknown beckoned, promising both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, a testament to the enduring human spirit's relentless pursuit of the horizon, be it earthly or celestial.
