
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a cryptic scroll promising untold riches and glory in the far east, burned a hole in his saddlebag.  Ahead lay weeks, perhaps months, of treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, bartering for meager meals in dusty villages, and navigating by the stars in the vast, uncharted wilderness.  This was no romantic quest, but a brutal test of endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out the viewport of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Nebulas swirled in vibrant hues outside, a breathtaking spectacle masking the perilous journey ahead.  Their mission: to reach the Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances between star systems, the constant threat of space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel made this expedition far more dangerous than any medieval pilgrimage. Yet, the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the galaxy – spurred her and her crew onward, fueled by ambition and a shared thirst for the unknown.
