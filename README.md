The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – jagged peaks clawing at the sky, shadowed valleys whispering tales of bandits and beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of peril or discovery.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing king.
