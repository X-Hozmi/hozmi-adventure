
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest was proving far more perilous than anticipated.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, wolves howled in the distance, and the biting chill of autumn winds threatened to freeze them solid. Yet, the lure of the fabled Dragon's hoard in the distant mountains fueled his resolve, promising glory and riches beyond his wildest dreams. Each creak of saddle leather and crunch of gravel underhoof was a step closer to his destiny, or perhaps, his doom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and establish first contact.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling space pirates was all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva, but the sheer vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored galaxies, constantly filled her with a sense of wonder and awe.  The unknown stretched before her, a tapestry woven with both peril and promise, the ultimate adventure awaiting just beyond the next jump gate.
