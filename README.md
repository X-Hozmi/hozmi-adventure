
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his weary body and spurred him further into the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring interstellar rescue operation, hundreds of light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace were child's play compared to the political machinations and alien encounters that threatened her mission.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless wonders and dangers – a constant reminder of the bravery and ingenuity required to explore the galaxy.
