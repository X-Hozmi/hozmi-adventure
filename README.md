
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's worn boots sunk into the earth.  Her journey from Canterbury to Rome was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder.  She'd dodged bandits in the Black Forest, shared meager meals with weary pilgrims, and slept under a canopy of stars more often than a roof. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording rushing rivers, and bartering for supplies in bustling, foreign marketplaces.  The road itself was her teacher, revealing the vastness of the world and the resilience of the human spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space still instilled a profound sense of awe and isolation.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against unforeseen celestial events and the ever-present threat of pirates.  The stars themselves were her guide, charting a course across unimaginable distances, and the bonds of her crew her solace in the infinite black.
