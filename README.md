
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she spurred her horse onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both rider and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches, fueled her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, was a new adventure, a gamble against the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a terrifying beauty, held wonders and dangers in equal measure.  Cosmic radiation threatened the ship's integrity, asteroid fields demanded precise navigation, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms kept him on edge. But the allure of discovery, of charting the uncharted, outweighed any fear, pushing him ever further into the cosmic unknown.
