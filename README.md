
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and personal markings, was her only guide across the unforgiving terrain.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, unforgiving weather, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death that stalked the land. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or an untimely end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, HALIX, calmly charting a course through the chaotic cosmic landscape.  Their mission: to retrieve a rare mineral from the desolate planet of Kryll, a world steeped in dangerous radiation and guarded by monstrous, bio-engineered creatures.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also terrifyingly lonely, the only company the hum of the ship's engines and the constant threat of unforeseen cosmic anomalies.  The galaxy, a playground of infinite wonders and unspeakable dangers, beckoned.
