
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandit trails and treacherous mountain passes were but minor inconveniences compared to the daunting task ahead – days of relentless travel, relying on the kindness of strangers and the strength of her own resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of space was a different kind of challenge than Elara’s, measured not in days but in light-years.  Instead of bandits, Ryla faced the dangers of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes.  But like Elara before her, Ryla found her drive in a deep-seated purpose, a thirst for discovery that fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
