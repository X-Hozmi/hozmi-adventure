
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a tyrannical lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandit trails and treacherous mountain passes were just part of the journey, a harsh but beautiful tapestry woven with the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the kaleidoscope of colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the cosmic dust and unknown dangers.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, held the same allure of the unknown that had driven travellers for millennia.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, with the rewards potentially outweighing the risks a thousandfold.
