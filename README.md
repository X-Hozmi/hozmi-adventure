
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and impending storm clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than supplies; it held the weight of her family's future, a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or peril – in equal measure. Bandits, famine, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant companions on this perilous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace held the promise of discovery – new worlds, alien civilizations, and the breathtaking beauty of uncharted space – but also the threat of unknown dangers, from hostile alien species to unpredictable gravitational anomalies. The universe was vast and unforgiving, but the potential rewards made the risks worthwhile.
