
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald’s retinue as they trudge across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the Sunstone, a jewel said to cure the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the knight's unwavering resolve, fueled by hope and the desperate pleas of his countrymen, pushes them onward, towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to a faster-than-light drive.  Warp jumps across vast distances, perilous asteroid fields, and encounters with unknown alien species are commonplace hazards. The weight of countless lives rests on Eva's shoulders as she pushes the boundaries of known space, seeking not just a lost colony, but a future for all humankind.
