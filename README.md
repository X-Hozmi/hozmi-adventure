
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a meager reward for the perilous journey she’d undertaken.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the freedom of the open road, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, new landscapes, and the tantalizing possibility of untold riches, or perhaps, a noble's heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and lurking dangers, held a different kind of thrill.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic storms and derelict space stations. Instead of plague, the threat was alien lifeforms and the ever-present risk of navigational errors in the uncharted sectors. But like Elara, Ryla was driven by the pursuit of discovery, the allure of the unknown pushing her ever further into the cosmic frontier.
