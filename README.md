
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, burned in his pocket.  His journey, a tapestry woven with peril and hardship, led him through shadowed forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and hope faltered, and finally, to the whispering, ever-present threat of the Black Death. Each sunrise brought a renewed battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present uncertainty of reaching his destination before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its sleek hull a sliver against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation through the swirling nebulae, a celestial labyrinth of gas and dust, was a constant test of skill and courage.  Her mission: to secure a vital mineral resource from a remote, uncharted planet, facing down not just the dangers of space – unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien lifeforms – but also the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of the cosmos.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the most daring of human ambitions.
