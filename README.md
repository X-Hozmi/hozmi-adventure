
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zamora, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wheel of her cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  But the whispered stories of Zamora's healing waters fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining spores to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace.  The vast expanse of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held dangers far beyond anything a medieval traveler could imagine – cosmic radiation, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  Yet, the thought of a thriving colony fueled her journey across the galaxy.
