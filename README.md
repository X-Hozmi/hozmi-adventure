
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the relentless journey across the sprawling kingdom of Aeridor.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a stark contrast to the rumors of desert sands and bandit-ridden passes that lay ahead.  My meager supplies – a pouch of dried meats, a waterskin, and a well-thumbed map – were all that stood between me and the unknown, the promise of adventure and perhaps, fortune, a distant beacon guiding my weary steps towards the legendary Sunstone city.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Stars blurred into streaks of iridescent light as we jumped between galaxies, the destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Captain Eva Reyes, her face etched with the weariness of countless jumps, charted our course across the cosmic sea.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, but the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, burned just as brightly in our hearts as it had in the hearts of those long-ago knights and adventurers.
