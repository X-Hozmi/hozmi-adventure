
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a perilous but necessary passage to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of untold riches and ancient magic fuel her journey, outweighing the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a test of her resilience and cunning as she navigates treacherous terrain and encounters both benevolent strangers and deadly foes.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the nebula's ethereal glow.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and the enigmatic Xylos civilization.  Faster-than-light travel shrinks the unimaginable distances, but the cosmos still holds its own dangers—uncharted asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and potentially hostile alien encounters.  Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by the boundless curiosity of humanity and the promise of discovery beyond the stars.
