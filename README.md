
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains, a worn map clutched in her gloved hand.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine – bandits were a constant threat, and the whispered tales of mythical beasts lurking in the shadowed valleys fueled her apprehension. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Ys, a place lost to the ages, pushed her onward, a beacon in the heart of a perilous journey that demanded courage, resilience, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was a test of skill and nerves, the ship shuddering under the impact of countless space rocks.  Jaxx's crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, scanned the cosmos for wormholes, hoping to shortcut the immense distance to the Andromeda galaxy. Their mission: to find the legendary Proxima system, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – a gamble with unimaginable rewards, and possibly, devastating consequences.
