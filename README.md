
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling into oblivion, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of her determination.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the quiet triumph of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational pull of binary stars and dodging rogue asteroid fields was child's play compared to the enigmatic nature of the anomaly itself.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to the colony's fate, and Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, was determined to find it, no matter the cost.
