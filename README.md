
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour clanking, spurred his destrier onwards.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the constant threat of illness hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meagre provisions in dusty villages, and the ever-present fear of encountering rival knights or marauding armies.  Yet, the lure of the holy city, the thrill of the unknown, pushed them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with its own dangers.  Unstable wormholes threatened to tear her ship apart, rogue asteroids posed a constant threat of collision, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her crew.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and potentially, new life, fueled their courage and determination. The vast cosmic ocean stretched before them, a breathtaking canvas of unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns.
