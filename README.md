
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle parchment detailing the rumored location of a lost monastery, said to hold ancient wisdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the slow, agonizing death by thirst.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, indifferent expanse of the landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with bizarre flora and potentially hostile lifeforms.  The jump to hyperspace had been jarring, but the breathtaking vista of countless stars, galaxies spiraling into infinity, dwarfed even the vastness of the medieval plains.  The risks were different, the challenges technological, but the same intoxicating blend of danger and discovery propelled her forward – a modern-day adventurer charting the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
