
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of weary faces and laden pack animals, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance in the distance, mirroring the turmoil in our hearts as we push onward, towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving desert itself, yet the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets fuel our relentless march.  The cracked earth beneath our feet holds both peril and promise, a testament to the boundless adventure – and brutal realities – of medieval travel.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, obsidian hull of the *Starseeker* cuts through the inky blackness, its engines a low hum against the vast silence of interstellar space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The challenge isn't just distance, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the constant threat of asteroid fields, and the unsettling unknown of alien landscapes.  This is a voyage not just across space, but into the very heart of the future, a journey defined by technological prowess and an insatiable human thirst for discovery.
