
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the rumors swirling in his mind:  of a lost city of gold rumored to lie beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains, guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled his mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation; this journey, undertaken for glory and fortune, was a gamble with life itself.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking vista of swirling gas and distant, uncharted planets.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of hope in the vast emptiness of space.  The dangers were less tangible than Thomas's, yet equally menacing:  unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel. The galaxy was her wilderness, and the thrill of discovery her only guide.
