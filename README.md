
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward. The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, each mile a challenge.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the key to ending a devastating plague, fueled his relentless journey across treacherous mountains and unforgiving plains.  Every sunrise brought fresh perils, and every sunset a renewed hope of reaching his elusive destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders in hyper-space, and repairing critical systems under the strain of interstellar travel tested her crew and her ship to their limits.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers, a constant reminder of the perilous yet alluring nature of exploration beyond the known stars.
