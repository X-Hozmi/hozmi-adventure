
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay the treacherous Silk Road, a tapestry woven with peril and promise.  We traded whispered stories with grizzled merchants in dusty caravanserai, bartered for supplies in vibrant bazaars overflowing with spices and silks, and navigated treacherous mountain passes shadowed by ancient ruins and the ever-present threat of bandits. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, from scorching deserts to freezing mountain passes, each step a gamble against the unknown.

Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in subjective time warped by hyperspace jumps and the endless, hypnotic swirl of nebulae. We face the hazards of rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships lurking in the shadows of uncharted star systems.  Each jump is a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, uncaring universe.
