
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow sharp in the crisp air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her lost brother, swallowed by the whispers of war across the kingdoms.  Each creaking footstep brought them closer to the unknown, closer to the whispers of bandits and the rumors of mythical beasts guarding ancient ruins.  The journey was fraught with peril, a tapestry woven with hardship and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms were everyday hazards, but the greatest threat was the unknown – a vast, unexplored expanse teeming with wonders and potential horrors beyond human comprehension. The cosmos was her battlefield, and her courage her only shield.
