
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion against her worn leather jerkin.  Her small band, a motley crew of mercenaries and scholars,  pressed onward, their destination the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each rocky outcrop, each shadowed valley, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of starvation and disease that stalked travelers across the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice against the odds, fueled by hope and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Starseeker*, cut a silent path through the nebula NGC 6357.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, held dangers as real as any medieval bandit:  rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  Yet, driven by the insatiable human desire to explore, Eva and her crew pushed forward, charting the course for humanity's next great leap into the cosmic unknown.
