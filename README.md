
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the wooden wheels was a testament to the miles already conquered, each sunrise a renewed promise of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the weary travellers, and the ever-present threat of famine loomed larger than any mountain. Yet, the lure of spice, silk, and untold riches spurred them onward, a tapestry of risk and reward woven into the very fabric of their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the starship 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of new life, new beginnings, and the uncharted wonders of a terraformed planet fueled her crew's determination.  Each hyperspace jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the cosmic odds, but the quest for expansion, for discovery, outweighed the inherent dangers.
