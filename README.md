
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the distance, fueled his weary body and unwavering resolve.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of the comms system and the occasional asteroid alert.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, dwarfed even the greatest medieval journeys.  Success meant not only survival, but the expansion of humanity's reach across the stars, a legacy far grander than any earthly kingdom.
