
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept moors.  Their destination: the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and the breathtaking beauty of a world largely untamed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders filled her days, each successful transit a testament to her skill and courage.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held the promise of discovery and the bitter sting of potential failure in equal measure.
