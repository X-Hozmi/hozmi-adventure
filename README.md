
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she urged her weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only sound the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves and the occasional cry of a hawk circling high above.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life – felt increasingly desperate with each passing mile.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain threatened to consume her before she ever reached her destination.  Yet, the glint of the distant shimmering mirage fueled her onward, a beacon in a sea of sand and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of unseen planets was a daily routine.  His mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, teetering on the edge of survival.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space presented challenges far beyond anything Elara could have imagined, but the stakes were equally high: the survival of an entire civilization rested on his shoulders, and the cold, uncaring void threatened to swallow them whole if he failed.
