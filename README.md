
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched Breton countryside.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the glint of the distant Pyrenees, a promise of warmer climes and spiritual solace, spurred them onward, their weary hearts fueled by faith and a shared thirst for adventure amidst the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils – unpredictable spatial anomalies, pirate raids from rogue corporations, and the sheer psychological toll of interstellar voyages.  But the vast, uncharted cosmos beckoned, promising untold discoveries and a future for humanity beyond the confines of a single planet, making the risks worthwhile for this intrepid explorer.
