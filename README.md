
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse. His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, seeking a cure for his ailing sister.  Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of fear through him, but the thought of his sister spurred him on, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.  Each day was a battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the unpredictable dangers of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a rogue gravitational anomaly.  The vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant, alien landscapes that flickered past her viewport.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils – unpredictable subspace currents, pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of system failures. But Eva, steeled by years of training and fueled by a relentless sense of duty, held the course, her gaze fixed on the faint, hopeful glimmer of her destination.
