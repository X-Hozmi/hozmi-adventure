
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the surrounding forest, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whisper of legend, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with unforeseen celestial anomalies and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own brand of danger, the subtle shifts in spacetime a constant reminder of the immense forces at play. But the promise of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach amongst the stars, fuelled her onward into the cosmic unknown.
