
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream. Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and even more perilous secrets. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were familiar companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, tempered by the stark reality of her solitary quest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson hues reflecting in her determined eyes.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space still held an element of terrifying beauty.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigation glitches, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all part of the galactic life, a far cry from the dusty trails of Elara's time, yet the spirit of adventure – the relentless pursuit of the unknown – burned just as brightly within her.
