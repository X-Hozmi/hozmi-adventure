
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow sharp in the crisp air. Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of winter storms were small price to pay for the chance at salvation. Each creak of the saddle, each distant wolf howl, fueled her desperate journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards on this run, but the allure of untold riches and scientific breakthroughs far outweighed the danger. The vast expanse of space, a tapestry woven with starlight and cosmic dust, held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, pushing Razor and his crew to the very limits of their courage and ingenuity.
