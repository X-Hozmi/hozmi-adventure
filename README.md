
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and meager coins; it held the map to the lost city of Zerzura, a legend whispered in hushed tones around crackling fires.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on this perilous journey across the untamed heart of the kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, the coordinates whispered on the ancient alien artifact clutched in her hand.  Beyond the shimmering veil of spacetime lay a potential new home for humanity, or a graveyard of forgotten civilizations.   The hum of the hyperdrive, the crackle of static on the comm, and the infinite expanse of the cosmos were a different kind of wilderness, yet the thrill of discovery, the tantalizing unknown, remained the same relentless siren's call.
