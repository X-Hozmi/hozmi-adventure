
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was arduous – weeks of relentless travel through sun-baked valleys and treacherous mountain passes,  facing bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape to navigate, but the promise of untold riches and glory fueled his weary bones.  He clutched the King's missive, its wax seal a testament to the perilous mission entrusted to him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a measured crawl across light years,  a symphony of humming engines and the silent hum of hyperspace.  Her crew, a diverse band from across the colonized planets, navigated asteroid fields, repaired warp conduits damaged by solar flares, and endured the psychological strain of months spent in the isolation of deep space. But the discovery of a potentially habitable planet, a new home for humanity, promised a reward far outweighing the dangers of the interstellar void.
