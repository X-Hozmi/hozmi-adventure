
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, ostensibly to deliver a vital message, was anything but safe. Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to outsmarting opportunistic highwaymen, testing Elara's courage and resourcefulness with every mile.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way. The journey, though measured in light-years rather than leagues, was no less perilous.  Navigation through unstable nebulae, the constant threat of pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present risk of engine failure demanded split-second decisions and nerves of steel.  But for Ryla, the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, the promise of discovering new worlds, outweighed any fear.
