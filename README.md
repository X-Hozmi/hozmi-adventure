
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a meager supply of dried meats and a map, its creases betraying countless folds and refolds charting her perilous journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored haven of  Sanctuary.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this medieval odyssey, testing her resilience and pushing her to the very limits of human endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black of intergalactic space.  Navigating the treacherous currents of the Xylos Nebula, she steered her vessel through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, the distant glimmer of a newly discovered planet, Kepler-186f, her beacon in the vast cosmic ocean.  While the dangers were different - cosmic radiation, engine failures, and the potential for encountering unknown alien lifeforms -  the thrill of exploration, the push to the boundaries of known space, mirrored the spirit of adventure that had driven travelers for millennia, a timeless human pursuit of the unknown.
