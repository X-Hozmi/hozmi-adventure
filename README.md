Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, fueled both his excitement and a gnawing fear.

But the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled their relentless exploration.
