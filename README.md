
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous highlands was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed passes, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of her resolve.  Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing brother, fueled her weary legs and spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve the Chronarium, a device capable of manipulating spacetime, from the derelict Xylossian outpost.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony was a constant battle against the odds, but the potential rewards – the ability to reunite fractured civilizations across the galaxy – outweighed the risks a thousand times over. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant, comforting presence in the vast, echoing emptiness of space.
