
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the scarred plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, guides his weary steed onward.  The King's ransom, a heavy chest strapped to the packhorse behind, is his burden and his prize.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are his constant companions.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new opportunity to test his mettle against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving men who would steal his treasure.  The journey to the distant capital is a tapestry woven with danger, hardship, and the fleeting hope of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of incandescent gas. Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking, terrifying beauty, stretches before her.  Warp jumps are risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders hangs heavy in the void.  Each star system visited brings its own unique peril - hostile alien life, decaying space stations, and the constant gnawing pressure of isolation. The pursuit of scientific advancement is a costly voyage, demanding skill, courage, and a resilience forged in the crucible of the cosmos.
