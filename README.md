
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and courage, a new step closer (or perhaps further) to his elusive goal. The journey itself was the adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and maintaining the fragile life support systems were but a few of the perils she faced.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, a lonely expanse contrasting sharply with the vibrant, alien worlds that occasionally punctuated her voyage.  The ultimate prize, however, was the discovery of new civilizations and the expansion of human knowledge across the cosmos.
