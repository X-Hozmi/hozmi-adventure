
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost relic of Saint Brigid, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of the Whispering Woods where brigands lurked and ancient magic stirred.  Each day brought new perils, new challenges, but the promise of glory and the whisper of legend fueled his tireless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids the size of small moons, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  Unlike the knights of old, Eva relied on advanced technology, but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same – a powerful engine driving her across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
