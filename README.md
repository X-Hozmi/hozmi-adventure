
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, slogs across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of our wagons, each rustle in the dry grass, speaks of potential peril – bandits, disease, or the unpredictable wrath of nature.  Yet, the lure of the spice markets in the East, the whispered tales of legendary cities, fuels our onward journey, a testament to human resilience and the insatiable thirst for the unknown.  We are bound together not only by shared destination, but by the shared risk, forging bonds as strong as the iron that binds our wheels.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the breathtaking view of the Andromeda galaxy sprawling across our viewport.  Our mission: to chart a newly discovered nebula, a region teeming with uncatalogued planets and potential threats.  The crew, a diverse team of xeno-biologists, astrophysicists, and seasoned pilots, faces challenges far removed from the bandits of Anatolia – hostile alien flora, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown civilizations.  But the prospect of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, outweighs the risks, a continuation of the human spirit's age-old quest for adventure.
