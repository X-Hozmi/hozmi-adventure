
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the parched plains of Anatolia.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Samarkand, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging Europe.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and the desperate hope for salvation spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the chilling uncertainty of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the newly colonized planet of Aethel.  The vast expanse of space held breathtaking beauty, but also the ever-present dangers of rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the mysterious, sentient beings whispered to inhabit the far reaches of the galaxy.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, propelled by the hope of a thriving future for humanity amongst the stars.
