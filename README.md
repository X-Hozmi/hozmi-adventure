Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very terrain itself – treacherous mountains and raging rivers – posed constant threats.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory,  as he navigated a land both beautiful and brutal, driven by faith and a fierce determination to reach his destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with its own unique dangers.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, rogue asteroids danced like deadly fireflies, and the unknown alien lifeforms lurking in the dark corners of space held a constant, unsettling mystery. Yet, propelled by scientific curiosity and a thirst for the unknown, Eva steered her vessel ever onward, pushing the boundaries of human exploration into the vast, uncharted cosmos.
