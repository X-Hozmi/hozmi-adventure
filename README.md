
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the only sounds the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each passing village brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred him on.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer*, a sleek vessel capable of traversing the vast distances between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, said to harbor a planet rich in the life-sustaining element, Xylium.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable nebulae, gravity wells threatening to crush the ship, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet,  the potential for discovery, and the responsibility to save her dying homeworld, fueled her unwavering determination.
