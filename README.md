
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient magic and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, of proving himself a worthy knight, pushed him relentlessly forward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory in a land both breathtaking and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems were just part of a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held infinite possibilities, but also profound isolation.  The thrill of discovery, however, fueled her journey across the galaxy, a journey as perilous as any medieval knight's quest, but on a scale far beyond imagining.
