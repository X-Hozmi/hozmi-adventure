
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, the whispered tales of the shrine's miraculous healing powers, combined with the lure of the unknown lands beyond their familiar borders, spurred them relentlessly forward, their battered packhorses their only steadfast allies in this unpredictable adventure across the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the hyperdrive.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the glittering tapestry of distant nebulae, offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and the ever-present threat of subspace anomalies – all were minor inconveniences compared to the potential reward waiting on a world light-years from home.
