
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope burning in her heart, fueled by unwavering sisterly love, propelled her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving deserts, towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starfall" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda Galaxy.  His mission, far more ambitious than Elara's, was to locate the mythical Xylos artifact – a device rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien star charts were just a few of the challenges he faced. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also terrifyingly lonely, a stark contrast to the familiar dangers of medieval lands, but the lure of discovery propelled him across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
