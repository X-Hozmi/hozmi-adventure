
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through a treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like the teeth of some monstrous beast.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, but the journey was fraught with peril.  Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself all threatened to halt his quest for glory and fortune.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of anticipation and fear down his spine.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, but the unknown depths of space held a different kind of terror.  The vast emptiness pressed in on her, a constant reminder of her isolation, yet the thrill of exploration – of being one of the first humans to set foot on a new world – fueled her onward.  The stars themselves seemed to beckon her closer to the next great mystery.
