
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Our destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought its own trials – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the promise of glory and fortune, spurred us onward, our resolve tested by every sunrise.

Conversely, imagine piloting the 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy in 2742.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and asteroid fields, we brave wormholes that spit us out light-years from our intended course.  Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos star system, rumored to harbor a civilization far surpassing our own.  Advanced technology helps, but the sheer scale of the cosmos, the unpredictable nature of spacetime itself, reminds us of the humbling insignificance of even the most advanced spacecraft in the face of the universe's infinite mysteries.
