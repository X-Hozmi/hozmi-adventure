
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onwards, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, encounters with suspicious merchants, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast canvas of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a survey of potentially habitable planets in the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, the shimmering tapestry of stars a constant reminder of her own insignificance, yet also the boundless possibilities awaiting her crew.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable thirst for exploration.
