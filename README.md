
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored monastery of Saint Gildas, said to hold the lost key to the King's ancient power, a key she desperately sought to protect her village from the encroaching war.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, the constant companion of a medieval traveler.

Centuries later,  Captain Rexa "Jax" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, peppered with the shimmering trails of distant stars and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, presented a different kind of danger, a cosmic expanse far removed from the familiar struggles of medieval lands, yet just as thrilling and unpredictable.
