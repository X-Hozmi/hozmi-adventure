
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her meager pack held little beyond dried meats, a waterskin perpetually threatening emptiness, and a worn map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each distant hawk's cry, held the potential for both peril and discovery. Bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey, a stark contrast to the whispered tales of the monastery's untold riches and potent healing balms.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of explored space, a whisper of a civilization clinging to survival on a planet shrouded in mystery.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time, but the vastness of the cosmos presented its own dangers: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of uncharted alien encounters. The hope of discovering a new ally, and perhaps, a new home for humanity, fueled her journey through the unyielding darkness of space.
