
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions: a chipped map, a worn prayer book, and a few dried figs.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far less daunting than her goal: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of both peril and purpose.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer'.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  The vastness of space, speckled with the light of a million suns, both awed and humbled her.  While pirates and hostile alien species lurked in the shadows, it was the sheer scale of the journey, the immense distance between worlds, that truly tested her courage. The success of her mission rested not only on her piloting skills, but also on her unwavering hope for a better future.
