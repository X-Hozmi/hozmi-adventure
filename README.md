
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her face.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled unpredictably, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept her constantly vigilant.  Yet, the burning hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, but the dangers remained real: rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of dimensional rifts.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of wonder, a profound loneliness that mirrored the vastness of the medieval landscape, yet fueled a different kind of courageous exploration.
