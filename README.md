
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing all she owns.  Ahead lies the treacherous Pyrenees, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her journey, yet the whispered promise of a new life fuels her onward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to overcome the unforgiving landscape.  The wind carries the scent of woodsmoke and distant storms, a symphony of both peril and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational currents is a daily challenge, each jump into hyperspace a gamble.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and astrophysicists, face the unknown with a blend of excitement and apprehension.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, is a constant reminder of their vulnerability amidst the unimaginable beauty of the cosmos.
