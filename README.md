
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her homespun tunic.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky, a formidable barrier between her and the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the whisper of Eldoria's legendary treasures and ancient knowledge fueled her onward, a flickering ember in the chilling night.

Conversely, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust Drifter* leaped across the void, a silver shard against the inky tapestry of the cosmos.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and repairing critical systems under the watchful gaze of a billion stars was a daily challenge, but the allure of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting unmapped galaxies, surpassed every risk.  The cosmos was a vast, unpredictable ocean, but it held promises beyond even the wildest medieval dreams.
