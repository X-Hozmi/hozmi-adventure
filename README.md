
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered promise of salvation spurred her onward, her heart pounding a rhythm against the relentless beat of her horse's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of cryogenically frozen flora to the burgeoning colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigation was treacherous, dodging rogue asteroids and the occasional pirate freighter.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on him, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of Earth.  Yet, the knowledge that his cargo held the potential to sustain life on a new world fueled his relentless journey across the galaxy.
