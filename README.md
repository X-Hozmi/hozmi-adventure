
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and hardtack; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to escape the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the tall grass, sparked a fresh wave of apprehension, but the lure of a rumored sanctuary in the distant north spurred her onward. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present fear of disease were but obstacles in her quest for survival, a test of endurance played out against the breathtaking backdrop of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope lost amidst the galactic expanse.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, wormholes unpredictable, and the vastness of space itself a daunting adversary.  But the allure of discovery, the potential for a new beginning for humanity, outweighed the risks. The ship's AI hummed a steady rhythm, a counterpoint to the captain's silent determination as he charted a course through the uncharted cosmos, facing alien landscapes and unexpected threats far beyond the reach of any medieval map.
