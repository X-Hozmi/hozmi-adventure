
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The relentless sun beat down on his back as he traversed the dusty track, the scent of woodsmoke and wild thyme clinging to the air.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse; yet, the lure of hope propelled him ever forward, through sun-drenched valleys and treacherous mountain passes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic vista unfolding before her.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were commonplace hazards. Yet, the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, fuelled her courage, pushing her to the edge of the known galaxy and beyond.
