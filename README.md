
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armour gleaming dully beneath the grey sky, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Alba from the clutches of a reclusive sorcerer in the distant, treacherous mountains.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of adventure, fueled his determined journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The whispered legends of the sorcerer's power only added to the intoxicating danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the constant hum of the ship's engines were a stark contrast to medieval travel, yet the sense of adventure remained the same – the thrill of exploration, the unknown dangers, and the relentless pursuit of the next undiscovered star system.
