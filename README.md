
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes, a biting wind whipping at my cloak.  My journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, felt less like a devout quest and more a desperate scramble for survival. Bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, the icy rivers threatened to sweep me away, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with every sunrise painting the snow-capped peaks a fiery orange, a fierce determination burned within me, fueling my onward trek through the harsh beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cabin as we jumped across the Orion Arm.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – pirate incursions in uncharted sectors, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, and the potential for encountering alien life forms far more advanced (and possibly hostile) than ourselves.  But the promise of galactic exploration, the thrill of charting unknown territories, dwarfed the dangers.  The cosmos, a vast and terrifying ocean, beckoned.
