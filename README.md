
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s ragged band crested the hill, their meager supplies dwindling as quickly as their hope.  Behind them lay months of brutal travel across the unforgiving landscape – the endless plains of the steppes, the treacherous mountain passes, and the whispering forests haunted by brigands.  Their quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland, felt as distant as the shimmering heat haze on the horizon.  Each footstep was a gamble, each sunrise a fragile promise.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*, the vast panorama of the Andromeda Galaxy sprawling across her viewport.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by a warp storm decades ago.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the ever-present threat of pirate raiders was commonplace; the true peril lay in the psychological toll of interstellar travel, the crushing loneliness punctuated by the vast, indifferent beauty of space. The fate of a civilization rested on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any physical burden.
