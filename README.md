
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Bruges, the smell of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun tunics.  Ahead lay the treacherous, untamed forests of Germany, then the snow-capped Alps, a daunting climb for both man and beast. We carried with us little more than hope, a worn map, and the whispered tales of a hidden monastery rumored to hold a sacred relic. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were our constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the quest, spurred us onward, each sunrise a promise of discovery.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting presence as we traversed the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The risks were different now—cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of alien lifeforms.  But the spirit of adventure remained the same, a burning ember in the heart of every crew member, propelling us forward across unimaginable distances towards a future that, until now, existed only in our dreams.
