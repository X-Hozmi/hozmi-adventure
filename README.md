
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather jerkin held little besides a chipped flintlock pistol, a well-thumbed map, and the hope of finding her brother, lost amongst the warring factions of the Byzantine Empire.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the relentless heat, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every treacherous mountain pass conquered, every bustling market town navigated, her determination burned brighter, fueled by the promise of reunion.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was a daily challenge, but the thrill of exploration overshadowed the inherent risks.  Each jump through hyperspace, each alien world encountered, brought a wealth of knowledge and the tantalizing possibility of discovering new life forms, pushing the boundaries of human understanding and forging a path for future generations amongst the cosmos.
