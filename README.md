
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, spurred his destrier onward.  The king's decree had sent him on a perilous quest across the treacherous lands, to secure a mythical herb rumored to cure the Black Death ravaging the kingdom.  His journey was fraught with danger – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim reminder of the stakes.  He carried with him not just the king's hopes, but the weight of an entire nation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional means.  Her ship, a marvel of advanced warp technology, allowed her to traverse the vast distances of space in a relative blink, but the cosmos held its own perils – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving void.  The weight of countless lives rested on her shoulders as she navigated the uncharted reaches of the universe.
