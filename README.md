
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or simply the unforgiving terrain itself.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the key to curing her village's plague.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of a step closer to her goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates were commonplace hazards, but the allure of discovering new life and charting unmapped galaxies overshadowed the risks.  The vastness of space instilled both awe and a sense of isolation, yet the shared mission amongst her crew forged a bond stronger than any earthly tie, their collective courage a beacon in the inky black.
