
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth’s worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and revelation – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey across a land both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint but persistent hinting at their survival.  Navigation charts were unreliable, the vast emptiness between stars a constant threat, punctuated by the occasional pirate raid or gravitational anomaly. Yet, the possibility of contact with a long-lost civilization, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination.
