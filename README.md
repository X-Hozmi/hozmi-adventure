
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the secrets of alchemical immortality.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion, yet the allure of the unknown spurred her onward, through sun-baked plains and treacherous mountain passes, towards a destiny shrouded in mystery.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfall" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent crystal from the ice planet of Glacies, a perilous journey through uncharted star systems teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light drives hummed, the ship bucking against cosmic currents.  Alien landscapes, shimmering with ethereal beauty and fraught with lethal predators, awaited her crew.  The galaxy stretched before them, a tapestry woven with wonder and peril, a testament to humanity’s boundless thirst for exploration.
