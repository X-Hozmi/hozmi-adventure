
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a ragged tapestry of men and beasts, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance like mischievous sprites, mocking our slow progress towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels our weary steps. The whispers of lost kingdoms and enchanted artifacts echo in the wind, a siren song that drowns out the harsh realities of the journey.


Millennia later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, silver vessel, *Starseeker*, leaps across the void between galaxies, its engines a low hum against the backdrop of cosmic silence.  We are explorers charting the unknown, searching for habitable worlds and the promise of new civilizations.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, dwarfs even the grandest medieval adventure, yet the human spirit of exploration remains the same – a relentless drive to push boundaries and uncover the universe's mysteries.
