
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked path across the plains.  Her destination:  the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation test her resilience with each passing day. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of ancient magic, and the desperate hope of reclaiming her birthright propel her onward, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a swathe through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the grasp of space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel are all part of the equation.  But the whispers of a powerful, unknown energy source emanating from the lost colony, coupled with the hope of finding survivors, fuel her crew's unwavering dedication, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, each star a beacon guiding them towards the unknown answers.
