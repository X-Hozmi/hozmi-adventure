
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the opulent tapestries of the King’s court he’d left behind. His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the blighted lands.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in his pursuit of glory and salvation. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, new landscapes, and the possibility of uncovering the secrets whispered by the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold, distant gleam of stars, was a humbling and exhilarating backdrop to her mission.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva.  The unknown stretched before her, a tapestry woven with the threads of discovery and the potential for unimaginable wonders – or catastrophic failure.
