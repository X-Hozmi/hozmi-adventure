
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the French countryside.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of spices and silks that fuelled my quest for the legendary city of Shamballa. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the gnawing hunger in my belly was a constant companion, more menacing than any brigand. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of discovery, spurred me onward, each sunrise painting a fresh canvas of adventure across the uncharted terrain.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped to warp speed, a silver streak against the inky canvas of the cosmos.  Destination: Kepler-186f, a terrestrial planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  My mission: to survey the planet’s potential for colonization. The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its potential dangers, felt infinitely more expansive than any medieval kingdom.  The stars themselves pulsed with the promise of untold wonders and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
