
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown. Yet, with every sunrise, her resolve hardened, fueled by the desperate hope of reuniting with her brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump risked tearing the ship apart, each moment was a gamble against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  Yet, the faint signal from the lost colony, a beacon in the endless darkness, spurred Ava onward, a testament to human resilience and the indomitable spirit of exploration.
