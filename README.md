
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a few precious coins, and a map as faded as her own hopes.  Ahead lay the legendary city of Saragossa, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and wonder; bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on this perilous journey across a fractured kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours swirling around its hull.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, rumored to hold a planet teeming with a rare, life-sustaining mineral.  The vast distances between star systems posed their own unique challenges; hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, pirate raids a constant threat, and the alien landscapes of each new planet held secrets both beautiful and potentially deadly.  The cosmos beckoned, a tantalizing mix of danger and discovery.
