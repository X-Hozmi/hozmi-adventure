
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all her worldly possessions – a few dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored hidden monastery of Saint Fiacre, said to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the thrill of the unknown, the promise of danger and discovery intertwined like the tangled vines snaking along the ancient stone walls she passed.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter.'  The vast expanse of space, a canvas of vibrant colours and swirling gases, held far greater perils than any medieval forest.  Asteroid fields were treacherous labyrinths, pirate ships lurked in the shadows, and the alien landscapes of distant planets promised wonders, and perhaps, annihilation.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a relic rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a quest as audacious and perilous as any medieval pilgrimage.
