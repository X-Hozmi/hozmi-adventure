
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the endless expanse of the land itself seemed a daunting adversary.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: negotiating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in dusty villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger.  Their adventure was a test of endurance, faith, and the unwavering bond between knight and squire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes, she and her crew faced threats far beyond the medieval knight's:  uncharted cosmic storms, hostile alien life forms, and the ever-present danger of equipment malfunction. The vastness of space, while breathtaking in its beauty, was a terrifying reminder of the fragility of life and the immense challenge of galactic exploration. Their voyage was a gamble on the future of humanity, a bold leap into the unknown.
