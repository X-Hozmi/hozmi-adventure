
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  The thrill of discovery, however, fueled his perseverance, pushing him further towards his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the gravitational pull of black holes.  Alien encounters, both hostile and benevolent, were commonplace; each jump a leap of faith into the vast, enigmatic expanse of space. The universe, in its breathtaking beauty and terrifying power, held both profound danger and untold wonders, a promise of both annihilation and discovery.
