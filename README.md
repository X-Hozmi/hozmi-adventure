
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in the woods, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of their destination. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the whispered legends of the shrine spurred them onwards, their resolve hardening with every league they covered.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f.  The journey was fraught with its own kind of danger – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But unlike the medieval pilgrimages of old, Eva had technology as her ally – advanced sensors, hyperdrive capabilities, and a crew of highly skilled specialists.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a cosmic tapestry woven from celestial wonders and perilous encounters.
