
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid delivered to a distant monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk circling overhead, punctuated the perilous journey, a constant reminder of the bandits, wild animals, and unpredictable weather that lay between her and salvation.  The ancient Roman roads, barely discernible beneath the encroaching scrub, offered little comfort against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the far-flung K'tharr system, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae and the blinking lights of other vessels, held its own dangers.  Pirate raids, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of warp-core failure were but a few of the challenges facing Razor and his crew as they pushed the boundaries of known space, their quest driven by the promise of untold riches and galactic renown.
