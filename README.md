
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Eldoria, and the hope it represents, fuel his relentless journey eastward, across rivers swollen with spring melt and through fields ripe for harvest, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit amidst hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes is commonplace. The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders, holds both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns.  But Eva, driven by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance, presses onward, charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
