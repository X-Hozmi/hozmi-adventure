
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the parched undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the King across treacherous mountain passes and lawless plains, was a race against time and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The sun beat down mercilessly, and the promise of safety lay only in the distant spires of the capital city, a beacon barely visible on the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped through hyperspace.  The vibrant nebulae swirling outside her viewport were a breathtaking, if somewhat nauseating, spectacle.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to interstellar colonization. The dangers were less tangible than Elara's – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life – yet no less perilous.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely and unforgiving frontier.
