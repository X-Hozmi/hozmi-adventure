
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains, the only witnesses to his perilous journey.  He carried a king's ransom in a hidden pouch, a desperate bid to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for his daughter's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled the gnawing fear of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape itself. His adventure was a race against time and the encroaching shadow of death.


Thousands of years later, Captain Elara steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to Xylos had been fraught with glitches, and now, the ship's navigation system sputtered intermittently.  Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a prize worth the risk, but the vast, uncharted expanse of space was a treacherous mistress.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships were mere inconveniences compared to the cosmic unknowns that lurked in the dark reaches between the stars.  Her adventure was a journey into the very fabric of existence.
