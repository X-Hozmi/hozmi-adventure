His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, propelled him forward, a lone figure against the vastness of the medieval world, his heart echoing the rhythm of his mule's hooves on the unforgiving earth.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unforeseen cosmic anomalies, Eva relied on her wits and the cutting-edge technology of her vessel.  The vast, inky expanse of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying dangers, but the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fueled her relentless pursuit across the galactic frontier.
