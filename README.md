
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, a ribbon of ochre winding through a landscape of rolling hills and sparse forests.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, guarded by treacherous mountain passes and wilder folk.  Each day brought new challenges: fording icy streams, negotiating with suspicious villagers, and evading the ever-present threat of bandits.  The journey was arduous, but the lure of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts were commonplace hazards on this interstellar voyage. The crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, faced the constant threat of equipment failure and the psychological strain of prolonged isolation. But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, fueled their determination.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, was a constant companion on this perilous, yet exhilarating, journey to the edge of the known galaxy.
