
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the oppressive heat.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost Orb of Aethelred, felt further away with every creaking mile.  The adventure was proving as perilous as the ancient scrolls had foretold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a breathtaking spectacle to the untrained eye, were just background noise to her expertly trained senses.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, a thrilling yet terrifying dance with the vast, unpredictable expanse of the cosmos.  The adventure of interstellar travel was a far cry from the medieval quests of old, but the thrill of discovery remained a constant.
