
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – seeds of a new life, a new hope for the famine-stricken village she'd left behind.  Each step was a gamble; bandits roamed these paths, and the unpredictable weather threatened to halt her progress entirely.  But the thought of her people spurred her onward, the promise of spring a beacon in the harsh, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the opportunistic raids of Kryll pirates tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  The vast emptiness of space pressed in, a stark contrast to the familiar warmth of her home planet, yet the thrill of discovery, the potential for advancement, fueled her and her crew to push the boundaries of human exploration.
