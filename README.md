
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a precarious hope for survival.  But the whispered legends of the Apostle's tomb fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable grandeur of the cosmos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the limits of their hyperdrive, but the promise of the fabled Xylos artifacts – ancient technologies capable of manipulating spacetime itself – was a lure too tempting to resist.  Across the vast gulf of space, battling cosmic storms and dodging pirate vessels, Ryla pressed forward, her destiny woven into the very fabric of the universe.
