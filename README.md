The air shimmers with heat, a cruel mockery of the promised silks and spices of the East.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, raging rivers swollen by monsoon rains, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.

Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of the universe, but the rewards, both scientific and spiritual, were immeasurable.
