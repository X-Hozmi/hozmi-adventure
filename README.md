Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of Eldoria, the promise of adventure and glory, propelled him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his elusive goal.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with perils unseen by any Earth-bound explorer.  Warp drives hummed, battling the gravitational pull of black holes and navigating asteroid fields the size of small planets.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested her courage and skill, but the potential discovery of a lost civilization, a chance to rewrite history, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
