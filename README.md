
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on the dusty track.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unknown terrors that lurked within it.  The journey tested his courage, his loyalty to his small band of companions, and the very limits of human endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure were her daily bread, each jump a leap of faith into the vast, unknowable expanse.  Her crew, a ragtag collection of specialists, was her family, their shared survival the only certainty in the breathtaking immensity of their undertaking.
