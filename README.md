
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns – tales of exotic spices in faraway lands, of shimmering silks and cities of gold.  Each creak of the saddle, each splash through a stream, was a step further into the unknown, a gamble against bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His quest: to find a mythical herb said to cure his ailing sister, a journey that demanded more courage than any knight's charge.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted a breathtaking canvas against the inky black, a far cry from the mundane, grey expanse of Earth.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous expedition across light years and through uncharted space.  Each jump through hyperspace, each encounter with a strange and wondrous alien civilisation, held both incredible promise and devastating risks. The universe was a vast, unforgiving ocean, but the thirst for discovery pushed her onward, fuelled by hope and a burning sense of duty.
