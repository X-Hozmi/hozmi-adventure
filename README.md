
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford icy rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits a constant shadow.  Each sunset brings the chilling beauty of the vast, unknown landscape, a stark reminder of our vulnerability against the elements and the unpredictable whims of fate.  Our destination, the mythical city of Zerzura, promises untold riches and dangers in equal measure – a journey fuelled by ambition and a thirst for the extraordinary.

Centuries hence, the stars are our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, dodging rogue asteroids and navigating treacherous gravitational fields.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, are on a mission to chart a newly discovered galaxy, seeking out habitable planets and uncovering the secrets of ancient alien civilizations. The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, is a constant companion on their perilous voyage, where the slightest malfunction could mean the difference between discovery and oblivion.
