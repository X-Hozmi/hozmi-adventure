
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Eurasian steppe stretching before him like a wrinkled tapestry.  His quest, a perilous journey to the mythical city of Zerzura rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland, was far from over.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the open road, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but the true adventure was only just beginning.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Prime, whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien technology were all part of the daily grind – a far cry from the romanticized tales of space exploration, but thrilling nonetheless. The vastness of space, however, offered its own unique perils, a chilling emptiness as profound as any medieval wilderness.
