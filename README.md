
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving deserts testing their endurance, and whispers of mythical creatures lurking in the shadows.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a perilous journey fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and chilling isolation, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unpredictable vastness of the cosmos.
