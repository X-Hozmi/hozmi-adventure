The journey across the untamed lands of medieval Europe was fraught with peril - bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the unpredictable weather could turn a pleasant voyage into a treacherous nightmare.

The dangers were immense, but so were the potential discoveries that could revolutionize humanity's understanding of the universe.
