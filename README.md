
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, drive her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, fuels the thrill of the unknown, the promise of adventure that outweighs the ever-present dangers of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet"  Janson pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the cockpit.  His mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with gravitational anomalies, pirate raids, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to chart unmapped territories, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration overrides any fear.  The vastness of space is a terrifying and exhilarating playground.
