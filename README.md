
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey to the fabled city of Saragossa, a quest for a lost scroll promising untold riches, had taken him through dense forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned, and into sun-baked plains where thirst was a constant companion. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to evading the clutches of opportunistic lords, but the lure of adventure and the whisper of ancient secrets kept him relentlessly pressing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of breathtaking cosmic beauty. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a colony fleeing a dying Earth.  The journey between galaxies was a test of endurance and technology, the ship buffeted by gravitational currents and facing unpredictable celestial phenomena.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of specialists, worked tirelessly, their dedication fueled by the shared dream of a new beginning.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the vast emptiness and the ever-present threat of encountering the unexpected.
