
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested his resolve, but the whispered promises of healing spurred him on. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a renewed commitment to the perilous journey ahead.  The road to Zerzura was paved not with gold, but with grit, determination, and the unwavering hope of survival.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate attacks from the Kryll Syndicate, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies demanded precision and courage. The vastness of space, beautiful yet unforgiving, stretched before her, a tapestry woven with shimmering gas clouds and the cold, stark emptiness of the void. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a testament to human ingenuity and the endless thirst for exploration.
