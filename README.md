
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he spurred it onward, the midday sun beating down on his worn leather armor.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his strength and skill, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease stalked him. Yet, the whisper of Eldoria's healing powers spurred him on, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the grim reaper's shadow.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  Instead of bandits, she faced unpredictable asteroid fields and the silent menace of space pirates.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the Kepler-186f colony, a planet light years from Earth, crucial to their survival.  The vast emptiness of space, the chilling isolation, and the constant threat of engine failure paled in comparison to the weight of responsibility resting on her slender shoulders – the lives of an entire colony depended on her successful navigation through the unforgiving cosmos.
