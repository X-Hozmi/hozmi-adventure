
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a road, snaked through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of Eldoria, a beacon in the encroaching darkness, fueled his weary limbs.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f,  a planet swallowed by the shifting gravitational currents of a nearby black hole.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, alien life forms were just another day's work for the seasoned starship captain. But the whispers of Kepler's fate – a colony trapped in time, a portal to another dimension – added a layer of intrigue and danger to the already perilous journey across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
