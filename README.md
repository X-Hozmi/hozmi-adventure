
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies from the ragtag band of pilgrims he'd joined.  Their destination: Santiago de Compostela, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their resilience, forging a shared experience stronger than any kinship they'd known before.


Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding not with fear, but with the thrill of discovery.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, a jewel shimmering in the inky blackness.  The journey had been arduous, a years-long odyssey across light-years and through treacherous asteroid fields.  But the promise of a new world, the chance to chart unmapped territories of the cosmos, fueled her resolve, a modern echo of the medieval pilgrim's quest, only instead of a holy shrine, they sought the cradle of new life.
