
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the rumored Silk Road, a tapestry of dangers and delights woven from sun-baked deserts, treacherous mountain passes, and bustling, exotic cities.  Every bend in the trail held the promise of bandits,  famine, or breathtaking beauty – a gamble she willingly took for the chance to reach the fabled lands of the East, to trade her family's hand-spun wool for silks and spices that shimmered like a forgotten dream.

Centuries later, Captain Jax's starship *Stardust* pierced the nebula, its engines a low hum against the cosmic symphony.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was still a perilous one, fraught with the risk of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on slower, less-armored vessels.  The vastness of space, breathtaking and terrifying in equal measure, held the promise of new beginnings, but only for those who survived the voyage.
