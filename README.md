
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies in the crowded caravan.  Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of Aquitaine was a test of endurance, each sunrise a gamble against disease, starvation, and ambush.  The whispers of the legendary Sunken City of Ys, said to hold unimaginable riches, fueled their perilous trek, a shimmering mirage against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast tapestry of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the dangers remained: unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets prowling the galactic lanes.  Her mission, to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Aethel, felt less like a conquest and more a desperate race against the encroaching darkness of an ancient, malevolent empire.
