
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward.  The map, brittle with age, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains, a fabled city lost to time.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her fear and her determination.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the terrain treacherous, and the ever-present gnawing hunger a test of her resilience. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of forgotten magic, kept her pushing forward, one arduous step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of starlight and the hum of the hyperdrive, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational pulls.  Despite the advanced technology, the vastness of space held a primal fear, the unknown a constant companion in the endless black, echoing the anxieties of those medieval travelers centuries past, their different struggles bound by a shared thirst for discovery.
