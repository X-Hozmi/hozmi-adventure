
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as he guides his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold the secrets of immortality, has led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests where outlaws and wild beasts lurk.  Each day brings new challenges – the gnawing hunger, the ever-present threat of bandits, and the relentless sun, but the whisper of Zerzura's magic fuels his determination.  He carries with him only his sword, his unwavering faith, and a map older than time itself.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields, avoiding hostile space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen supplies is a daily struggle.  Yet, the hope of finding the colonists, of understanding the strange signals emanating from Xylos, keeps her and her crew pushing onward.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas of cosmic wonders and deadly unknowns that tests the limits of human courage and ingenuity.
