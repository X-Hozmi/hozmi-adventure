
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate flight.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed wood, and the relentless sun beat down on their meager supplies.  Each creak of their worn saddlebags, each rustle in the long grass, sent a shiver of apprehension down their spines. Their adventure wasn't the planned, pious one, but a desperate scramble for survival amidst the harsh realities of a medieval land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vast distances between galaxies were nothing compared to the treacherous political landscape awaiting her.  Rival corporations, alien pirates, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies made every jump through hyperspace a gamble.  But the promise of discovering a new life, a new beginning, propelled her forward, making the perilous journey a thrilling, if deadly, adventure across the stars.
