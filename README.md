
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each day brought the threat of banditry, starvation, or the unknown dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness.  Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Ys, lost to the sea centuries ago but rumored to lie hidden in these mountains, spurred her onward.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a constant dance between survival and the relentless pursuit of a legendary dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't merely across space, but through time; relativistic effects meant years would pass aboard her ship for every month experienced on Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields. But the possibility of discovering new life, of charting unexplored worlds, fuelled her crew's unwavering determination. The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying loneliness and the breathtaking majesty of creation itself.
