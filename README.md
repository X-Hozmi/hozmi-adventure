
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the breadth of France, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine promising healing for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the nights cold and unforgiving, and the endless stretches of forest whispered with ancient, unsettling secrets. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship *Stardust* through a nebula, the cosmic dust swirling around them like a celestial river.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were commonplace occurrences; the vastness of space itself posed an ever-present danger. Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies pushed her and her crew forward, braving the unknowns of the cosmos.
