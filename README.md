
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of Eldoria's fabled spires, visible only in the clearest twilight, fueled their determination, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling unpredictable spatial anomalies were commonplace, but the sheer scale of interstellar travel brought a unique kind of terror.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant shimmer of galaxies, instilled both awe and a profound sense of isolation.  Yet, the hope of discovering new life and charting unknown territories spurred her onwards, a modern-day explorer charting the cosmic sea.
