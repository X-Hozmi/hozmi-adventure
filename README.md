
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, the unpredictable terrain tested both horse and rider, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of Zerzura, whispered to exist beyond the known world, fueled her onward.  The whispered legends of its untold riches and ancient magic were a powerful counterpoint to the harsh realities of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach. The breathtaking spectacle of celestial wonders was constantly threatened by unpredictable gravitational currents and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, possibly hostile, alien civilizations.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos, but the promise of discovery drove her and her crew relentlessly forward.
