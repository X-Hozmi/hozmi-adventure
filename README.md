
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the ravaged lands of Aquitaine was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the villages, and the ever-present threat of war hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new obstacle to overcome: treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-growing gnawing fear of losing her way entirely. Yet, the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, said to hold untold riches and secrets, fueled her relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of iridescent gas.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Her mission, a perilous one, was to establish a forward base and scout for resources.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the threat of pirate attacks, equipment malfunctions, and the unknown dangers of an alien world were constant companions.  But the potential discovery of a new home for humanity spurred her onward, a beacon brighter than any star in the inky blackness.
