
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band spurred their mounts onward, the setting sun casting long shadows that danced with the dust devils swirling around them. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with perilous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, fueled by the whispered legends of Eldoria's wonders and the desperate need to return home.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations, traversing unmapped star systems and potentially encountering alien civilizations.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the ship's tiny size, but Eva pressed on, driven by the insatiable human need to explore the unknown, to push the boundaries of what's possible, and to leave their mark on the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
