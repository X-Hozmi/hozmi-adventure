
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving longer and far more perilous than anticipated.  Bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, starvation gnawed at his belly, and the endless expanse of the Iberian Peninsula felt like a cruel, unforgiving mistress.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, the hyperspace turbulence leaving her nauseous.  But the breathtaking sight of a planet bathed in the crimson light of a dwarf star erased all discomfort.  Her mission: to establish contact with a potentially sentient species.  The vast distances between stars were a constant reminder of the human race's audacity, their endless quest to explore and understand the mysteries held within the unfathomable expanse of the cosmos.
