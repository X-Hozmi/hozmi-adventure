
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones across countless taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges she faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers. The promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fueled her relentless pursuit, a solitary figure against the immensity of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming agents across three galaxies, a task made infinitely more complex by the ever-present threat of pirate raiders and unpredictable wormholes.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant dance between exhilarating speed and catastrophic failure, demanding split-second decisions and nerves of steel. The cosmic expanse, both breathtaking and terrifying, dwarfed even the most ambitious human endeavors, yet Rylan pressed on, driven by the promise of a hefty reward and a touch of that age-old human spirit: the irresistible call of the unknown.
