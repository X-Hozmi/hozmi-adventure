
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the crude map, its edges frayed, showing the rumored location of the lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the dangers he faced, but the whispered tales of Eldoria's untold riches fueled his every step, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape. The journey promised glory, or death – and Thomas was prepared for both.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst cosmic giants.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Through asteroid fields teeming with pirates and treacherous gravitational wells, she pushed her ship to its limits. The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a stark contrast to the medieval world, yet the allure of discovery, the pursuit of the impossible, remained the same driving force.
