
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the gleam of hope, fueled by the desperate pleas of his people, spurred him onward, his journey a testament to the indomitable spirit of medieval adventurers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The journey was fraught with peril: unpredictable gravitational fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of engine failure. But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, navigated the cosmic expanse with skill and courage, a modern-day explorer charting the unmapped territories of the galaxy.
