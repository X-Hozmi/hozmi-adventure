
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The journey across the ravaged countryside had been brutal; bandits lurked in the shadows of ruined castles, and the relentless sun beat down upon their small band.  Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled their relentless pursuit.  Each creak of saddle leather, each strained breath of his horse, was a testament to the perilous yet thrilling adventure unfolding before them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of stars, held a different kind of terror than bandits and scorching sun, but the thrill of discovery was just as potent.  Each jump through hyperspace, each navigation of asteroid fields, was a gamble, a testament to the human spirit's unending thirst for exploration beyond the familiar confines of home.
