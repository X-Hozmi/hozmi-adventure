
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll; the once-bright colours of his banner were now faded and dusty, mirroring the exhaustion etched onto his face.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to be haunted by boggarts and worse, a necessary evil to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria and the legendary Sunstone hidden within.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, sent a shiver down his spine, fueling the thrilling, terrifying uncertainty of his quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been harrowing, the warp drive pushing the vessel to its limits.  Ahead lay a new world, potentially teeming with life, both benevolent and hostile.  The thrill of discovery mingled with the cold, hard reality of potential danger; the unknown was a formidable foe, but the promise of galactic expansion, of charting humanity's destiny among the stars, was a siren song too powerful to resist.
