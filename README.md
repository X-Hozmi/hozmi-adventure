
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, a motley crew bound for the mythical city of Samarkand.  Days bled into weeks, the rhythm of our lives dictated by the creak of wagon wheels, the whinny of horses, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  We crossed sun-baked plains, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and braved the icy grip of winter in the Carpathian mountains, each hardship forging an unbreakable bond between us.  The lure of the East, the whispers of silks and spices, fueled our weary limbs and hardened our resolve.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is our constant companion.  We’re traversing the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning millennia compressed into subjective weeks thanks to relativistic effects.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  The endless expanse of stars, the breathtaking nebulae encountered along the way, dwarfed the challenges of navigating asteroid fields and navigating the complex political landscape of interstellar travel.  Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, but the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning, drives us onward.
