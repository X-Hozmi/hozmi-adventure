
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty of the journey ahead.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the looming shadow of the Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential harbinger of danger, yet the thrill of the unknown fueled her relentless pace.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents between galaxies was child's play for her seasoned crew, but the destination, a rumored planet teeming with Xylanite – a mineral capable of limitless energy – presented a challenge unlike any other.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, from rogue asteroids to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, but the potential reward, the chance to change the fate of entire star systems, made the risk worthwhile.  The journey was a gamble, but one Ryla was willing to take.
