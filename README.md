
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise – or the threat – of adventure.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown were her constant companions on this perilous journey across the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted towards the uncharted galaxy of Andromeda.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a lullaby against the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Alien encounters, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of system failure were just some of the hurdles awaiting her on this voyage across the cosmos, a journey far removed from the medieval struggles of her ancestors but no less fraught with danger and daring.
