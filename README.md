He'd traded his meager inheritance for a map promising untold riches hidden in a forgotten monastery nestled deep in the Carpathian mountains.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown were constant companions on his arduous journey, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of hope and dread in equal measure.  The whispered legends of the monastery's secrets, and the glittering promise of gold, spurred him relentlessly forward.

The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, had already stretched across months, traversing the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  The rhythmic hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the loneliness of interstellar space, punctuated only by the crackle of comms and the occasional alert from the navigation systems.  The potential rewards—a revolution in space travel—outweighed the risks of unknown anomalies and the sheer terrifying scale of the cosmos.
