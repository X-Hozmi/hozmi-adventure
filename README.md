
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  His journey had already taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the snow fell relentlessly, and past shimmering rivers teeming with unseen dangers.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, weary companions, and the ever-present threat of ambush.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the whispered promise of glory, propelled him forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, stranded beyond the known reaches of the Galactic Federation.  Warp drives hummed, starlight painted iridescent streaks across her viewport as she navigated asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational currents.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless unknowns;  communication was sporadic, supplies limited, and the threat of pirates, rogue AI, and unforeseen cosmic events a constant companion. But the hope of finding Nova Terra, and the potential for discovery, fueled her unwavering determination.
