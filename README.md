
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves brought a fresh wave of apprehension; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey from Aquitaine to the Holy Land.  He carried a king's ransom in gold, a desperate plea for aid scrawled on parchment, and the weight of his family's hopes on his broad shoulders.  Survival, not comfort, dictated every decision.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a remote research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Warp drive hummed, a constant reminder of the vast distances separating her from home,  while automated systems monitored for asteroid fields and hostile alien life.  The galaxy was a boundless frontier, promising incredible discoveries, but riddled with the perils of the unknown.
