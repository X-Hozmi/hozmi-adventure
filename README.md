
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel bulging with maps and meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the promise of reaching the fabled city of Alexandria, rumored to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery in this unforgiving yet breathtaking landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' hurtled through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions beyond the Galactic Federation, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human population.  The risks were immense – uncharted wormholes, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of system failure. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the possibility of finding new life fueled Ryla's unwavering determination.  Each jump to hyperspace brought a thrilling, terrifying leap into the unknown.
