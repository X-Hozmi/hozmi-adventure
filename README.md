
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the gleam of hope, fueled by whispered legends and the desperate pleas of his people, kept him pushing towards the horizon, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula of incandescent gas, her destination a newly discovered planet in the Andromeda galaxy.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and unimaginable distances, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, yet the human desire to explore, to discover, to push the boundaries of the known, burned just as brightly within her.
