
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for food in unfamiliar villages.  Yet, with each step, the thrill of the unknown spurred him onward, a tapestry of hardship and wonder woven into the very fabric of his adventure.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage fraught with its own unique dangers.  Instead of bandits, she faced the unpredictable currents of space-time; instead of disease, the potential failure of her ship's hyperdrive.  Alien landscapes shimmered on her viewscreen, promising both discovery and destruction.  The vastness of the cosmos pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single ship, yet also the limitless possibilities that lay within reach of her bold expedition.
