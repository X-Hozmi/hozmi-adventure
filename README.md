
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, entrusted to her safekeeping as she journeyed to Toledo, a city rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the very real threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of distant mountains, the sight of a migrating flock of birds, fueled her relentless onward push.  This was not mere travel, but a desperate race against time, a perilous adventure etched in the very fabric of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the Xylos Nebula in the starship *Stardust*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Instead of bandits, he faced cosmic radiation and unpredictable asteroid fields.  Instead of starvation, the ever-present threat of oxygen depletion loomed.  Yet the vast, breathtaking expanse of space, the shimmer of distant galaxies, and the promise of a new world spurred him forward.  This wasn't just a journey across the cosmos; it was a bold step into the unknown, a voyage of exploration and discovery unlike any other.
