
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  The journey had been brutal; bandits ambushed them in shadowed forests, rivers swelled into raging torrents, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and glory, kept him pressing forward, each creak of saddle leather a testament to his unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike any encountered before.  The journey across the vast expanse of the Milky Way had tested the limits of both ship and crew; navigating treacherous asteroid fields, repairing warp core breaches under the pressure of cosmic radiation, and battling the creeping loneliness of interstellar space had forged them into a resilient band.  But the potential discovery of a new civilization, the promise of unlocking untold scientific knowledge, fueled their relentless pursuit of the unknown.
