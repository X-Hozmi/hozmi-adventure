
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to recover the lost relic of St. Jude, rumored to be hidden within the treacherous Black Forest.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions, but the lure of glory and the whispered promise of divine power drive him onward. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for both peril and untold riches.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' across the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a colony fleeing the dying Earth.  Nebulae shimmer like celestial oceans, and the vastness of space presses in on her, a constant reminder of the loneliness and danger inherent in interstellar travel.  Warp drives hum, alien life forms are scanned, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile civilizations keeps her and her crew on high alert.  The reward, however, is a future for humanity, a chance to rewrite its destiny among the stars.
