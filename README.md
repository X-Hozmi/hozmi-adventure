
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the whispered hope of reaching the fabled city of Zaragoza.  Each day was a battle against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of the journey.  The whispers of mythical creatures and haunted forests only added to the thrill, the very air crackling with the promise of adventure and the ever-present threat of peril.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the nebula, the swirling colours a hypnotic dance around his starship.  His mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, rumored to hold a planet teeming with a new form of energy.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperjumps risked encountering rogue asteroids or, worse, unseen spatial anomalies.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to add another star system to the Federation's map, fueled his every decision, a different kind of bravery in a different age, yet still driven by the same intrepid spirit.
