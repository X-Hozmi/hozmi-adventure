
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor comfort against the gnawing fear in her belly.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Alexandria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother’s plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each flash of hawk overhead, felt like a potential ambush in a land rife with bandits and warring lords.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship – thirst, hunger, the constant threat of violence – but the hope of salvation fueled her weary steps forward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a lullaby against the deafening silence of interstellar space.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a humanity desperate for expansion.  The challenges were different – navigating treacherous nebulae, facing unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – but the spirit of adventure, the burning desire to explore the unknown, remained the same powerful force pushing them onward, across the unimaginable gulf between stars.
