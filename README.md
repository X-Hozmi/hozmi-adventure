
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest to find a lost family heirloom, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both her strength and her courage, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered tales of Zaragoza's riches and the unwavering hope in her heart spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colours and distant galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms a constant concern.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover the mysteries of Aethel's fate, fueled her relentless pursuit across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
