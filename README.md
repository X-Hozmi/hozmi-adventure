
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses’ hooves kicking up clouds of ochre.  The whispered legends of the lost city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis veiled in myth, spurred them onward.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the promise of danger – bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the uncertain whispers of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for humanity’s expanding reach.  The dangers were different, but no less perilous – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for unimaginable wonders, outweighed the risks, propelling her ever forward into the inky black.
