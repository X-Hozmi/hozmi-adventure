
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map promising a legendary hidden monastery, a few meager coins, and a fierce determination forged in the fires of a broken betrothal.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, heightened the ever-present tension, the wilderness a constant threat alongside bandits and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Reaching the monastery, if she lived to do so, held the key to her future.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Petrova piloted the *Starseeker*, its sleek hull a silver gleam against the inky blackness punctuated by the swirling colours of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a potentially habitable planet lightyears away.  The journey was fraught with peril, the unpredictability of space a constant companion, from rogue asteroids to unpredictable gravitational fields.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the hope of discovering new life and civilizations, outweighed the risk for this fearless explorer, each jump through hyperspace a breathtaking leap into the vast, uncharted territories of the cosmos.
