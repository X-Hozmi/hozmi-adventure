The rutted track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering peaks clawed at a sky perpetually bruised with storm clouds, while the valley below teemed with bandits and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the distant Abbey of Saint Aldhelm, demanded courage, resilience, and a keen eye for both friend and foe.  Each day brought new challenges, from fording icy rivers to navigating treacherous mountain passes, but the promise of adventure fueled his every step.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

The vastness of space, a symphony of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, held both unimaginable beauty and mortal peril.  The success of her mission, to find a new home for humanity, rested on her skill, her courage, and the unwavering strength of her crew.
