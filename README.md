
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, heightened the sense of adventure, a perilous journey to find her exiled brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the obstacles strewn across her path,  yet the promise of reunion fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, unknown darkness.  The world felt vast and untamed, every step a gamble.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void, leaving behind the swirling nebula of the Horsehead and hurtling towards the uncharted Xylos system.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship rumored to have discovered a new form of faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the hostile Kryll Hegemony were child's play compared to the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of rewriting galactic history, kept her engines roaring towards the edge of known space.
