
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she trudges through the unforgiving French countryside.  Her worn map, more tattered than trustworthy, guides her westward, towards rumored riches and a clandestine meeting with a powerful merchant.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  The journey is arduous, filled with the chilling damp of forests, the scorching heat of sun-baked plains, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. But the allure of untold wealth, and the freedom of the open road, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the complex political landscape of various alien civilizations are everyday challenges.  The vastness of space dwarfs their ship, and the unknown lurks in every unexplored system, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the awesome indifference of the cosmos. Yet, the promise of discovery, of new worlds and new beginnings, drives them ever further into the great unknown.
