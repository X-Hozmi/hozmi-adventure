
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a chipped map promising the legendary city of Zerzura.  Bandits were a constant threat, the whispering winds carrying rumors of monstrous creatures in the shadowed canyons, and the ever-present gnawing hunger a companion as relentless as the desert sun. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the known edges of her world, spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of impossible colours, the distant galaxies swirling like cosmic paint.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships was child's play compared to the bureaucratic tangles of interstellar trade permits and the existential dread of encountering a truly alien intelligence. Yet, the vastness of space, the promise of discovery at the edge of the known universe, burned brighter than any star.
