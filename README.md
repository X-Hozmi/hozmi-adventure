
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her gloved hand.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unexpected rains, and the whispers of mythical beasts keep her ever vigilant. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a test of her endurance and courage, as she pushes onward, driven by a quest older than time itself.  The rough-hewn path is her only guide, a thread connecting her to a destiny both promising and perilous.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is just the beginning.  The vast distances between star systems and the unknown dangers lurking in the unexplored reaches of space demand unwavering focus and a crew united by a common purpose. Each jump through hyperspace brings the crew closer to their goal, but also closer to the potential discovery of something both wondrous and terrifying.
