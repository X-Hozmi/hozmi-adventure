
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's writ, a sealed scroll clutched tight in his hand, promised riches and lands beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the endless expanse of unknown wilderness tested his courage and resilience at every turn. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the relief of another hard-won mile closer to his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been treacherous, a gamble against unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Her mission: to secure a rare mineral vital to the survival of her dying homeworld.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of the vast interstellar expanse were far from eliminated.  Elara knew the price of exploration was high, paid in sweat, sleepless nights, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.
