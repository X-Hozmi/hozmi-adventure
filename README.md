
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – a stray arrow from a rival lord's ambush.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged Abbey of St. Jude, felt less like a pilgrimage and more a desperate race against the encroaching shadows of both night and war.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting vibration against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  The true adventure, however, wasn't the journey itself, but the unknowns awaiting them on the other side – a new world teeming with possibilities, and perhaps, unimaginable dangers.
