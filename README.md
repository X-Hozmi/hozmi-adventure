
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudges onward. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis in a desolate land, fuel his weary steps, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.  He relies on the kindness of strangers, the resilience of his mule, and the unwavering hope in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable wormhole currents is commonplace.  Unlike Thomas, she has advanced technology, a seasoned crew, and a sophisticated starship at her disposal. However, the vast, unforgiving expanse of space presents its own unique challenges – the loneliness of deep space, the unpredictable nature of alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failures.  Her success depends not only on her piloting skills but also on her courage and unwavering belief in the possibility of finding the lost colonists.
