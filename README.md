
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, spurred his weary horse onward.  The wind whipped across the desolate plains of Hungary, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and impending storm.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the lost scroll of King Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but small obstacles in the face of such a grand ambition.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another league closer to his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of limitless energy said to exist on the uncharted planet of Aethel.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with danger, pirate raids were a constant threat, and the very fabric of spacetime seemed to conspire against them. But the allure of the crystal, the promise of a future free from energy scarcity, fueled her unwavering determination to push the boundaries of human exploration, even into the face of the unknown.
