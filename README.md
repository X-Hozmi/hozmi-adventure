
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience.  Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura's hidden wonders, its ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a flickering torch in the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense canvas of space.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace itself posed constant threats.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey demanding both skill and courage in the face of the cosmos's indifferent grandeur.
