
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The King's ransom, a hefty sack of gold coins promised to her father for safe delivery, bumped against her ribs with every step.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, sent shivers down her spine—bandits roamed these lands, and the whispers of forest spirits were as terrifying as any human threat.  Her journey to Paris was a tapestry woven with danger, hardship, and the unwavering hope of fulfilling her father's dying wish.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Roxy" Valera piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold both unimaginable wealth and perilous alien lifeforms.  Navigation through the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers tested her skills and courage to the limit, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos.  Her quest for the energy source was not just about galactic trade; it was about ensuring the survival of her people.
