
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked plains stretching before her like a sea of brown.  Her meager possessions – a worn map, a waterskin nearly empty, and a rusty sword – were all that stood between her and the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the unknown dangers of a journey across a land ruled by both nature's whims and the capriciousness of men.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents of spacetime, she charted a course towards the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in Earth time, a mere blink in the vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a gamble on humanity’s future among the stars, a risk weighed against the crushing loneliness and unpredictable perils of interstellar travel.
