
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling manor and a forced marriage.  Each creak of the saddle, each stumble of the mule, echoed the anxieties in her heart as she journeyed towards the rumored haven of Avignon, a city promising sanctuary and a future beyond her grasp.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation.  His mission: a daring rescue operation across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  The risks were cosmic - rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the reward – the retrieval of a vital scientist held captive by a ruthless alien empire – outweighed the peril a thousandfold.  The fate of countless worlds rested on his shoulders, a weight as heavy as the stars themselves.
