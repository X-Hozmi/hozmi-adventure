
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Elara steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations using conventional methods.  Utilizing experimental warp technology, however, Elara hoped to traverse the unimaginable distances in a fraction of the time.  The risks were immense – the instability of the warp drive, the unknown dangers lurking within uncharted space, and the constant threat of pirate attacks – but the promise of finding the lost colonists, and perhaps unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel, spurred her onward.
