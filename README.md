
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis hidden deep within the unforgiving sands of the Sahara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling ruins, and the shimmering heat haze played tricks on her eyes, making the already arduous trek seem even more daunting.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, fueling her determination to reach her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Xylar navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable hazards of hyperspace.  Nebulae shimmered like cosmic paintings around her vessel, while the faint signals from distant quasars offered the only solace in the vast, inky blackness.  Each jump through the hyperspace tunnel was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the hope of finding Aethel, and perhaps a piece of her own forgotten past, kept her engines humming and her spirit soaring.
