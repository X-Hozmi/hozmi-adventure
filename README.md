
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in fiery hues. Her journey to the fabled city of Avalon had been arduous, fraught with peril.  She'd dodged bandits in shadowed forests, bartered for meager sustenance in dusty villages, and braved the treacherous mountain passes, all for a glimpse of the legendary healer rumored to reside there.  The whispers of magic and ancient knowledge spurred her onward, pushing past fatigue and fear.

Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space, a stark contrast to Elara's earthly struggles, was both terrifying and exhilarating. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. The potential rewards – discovering new life, unlocking the secrets of the cosmos – outweighed the immense risks, fueling Ryla's relentless pursuit of the stars.
