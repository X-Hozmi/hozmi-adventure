
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, a cacophony of hawkers and sailors.  Ahead lay the treacherous, sun-baked roads of Provence, then the unforgiving Alps, their peaks shrouded in mist.  We sought the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power, a quest fueled by rumours and ancient maps.  Each creak of our wagon wheels, each shared loaf of bread around a crackling fire, etched another memory into the tapestry of our perilous adventure. Bandits, storms, and dwindling supplies threatened to undo us, yet the allure of the unknown propelled us onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known sectors, navigated asteroid fields and nebulae, the vastness of space a breathtaking yet daunting spectacle.  The risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering unpredictable gravitational anomalies was ever-present, yet the potential rewards—a breakthrough in interstellar travel—made the journey an irresistible gamble. The stars themselves were our guide, each twinkling light a promise of the unknown.
