
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map, promising the location of a legendary monastery rumored to hold the secrets of a powerful artifact.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of her clandestine journey; bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous quest for knowledge.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the dangers remained constant – pirates, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole jumps all threatened to end his journey before he could reach his destination.
