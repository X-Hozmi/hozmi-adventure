
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled him forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the chilling emptiness between stars.  But the potential rewards were even greater – the chance to secure a future for her species, to discover new life and civilizations beyond the pale blue dot they’d left behind.
