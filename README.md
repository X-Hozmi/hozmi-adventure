
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving steppe stretching before them. Their journey to the Khan's court was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, unpredictable weather threatened to halt their progress, and the very landscape seemed to conspire against them.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for supplies in wary villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger.  Their reward, however, was the thrill of the unknown, the chance to experience cultures far removed from their own, and the glory that awaited a successful mission.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light years of interstellar space. The journey to Kepler-186f was less about physical hardship and more about the relentless pressure of the cosmos – unpredictable solar flares, the constant hum of the warp drive, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile life forms.  Yet, the vast emptiness held a sublime beauty, and the possibility of discovering a new world fuelled her and her crew, driving them further into the unexplored expanse of the galaxy.
