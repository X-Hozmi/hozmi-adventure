
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie beneath the restless waves.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, shadowy forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and ancient magic, fueled his weary body and spurred him relentlessly forward, a solitary knight against the vast and unpredictable landscape.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with alien flora and fauna unlike anything humanity had encountered.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the watchful gaze of hostile alien patrols, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and her own unwavering resolve.  The vast emptiness of space, filled with the silent promise of discovery and the ever-present danger of the unknown, was her battlefield, and the cosmos her ultimate adversary.
