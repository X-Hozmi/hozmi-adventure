
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic, had tested their endurance.  Days bled into weeks, marked by sun-scorched landscapes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, the whispered promise of salvation pushing them further across the unforgiving terrain. The legendary monastery, though still distant, felt a little closer with each arduous mile conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her starship *Stardust*. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, measured in light-years, was punctuated by warp jumps through uncharted space, close calls with space pirates, and the ever-present hum of the ship’s hyperdrive. Yet, the possibility of discovering the lost colonists, of uncovering their fate, fueled her resolve, pushing her further into the breathtaking and terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
