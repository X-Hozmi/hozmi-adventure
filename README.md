
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mire.  Ahead, the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier on her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous trek across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the unknown dangers that lurked around every bend in the road.  The promise of Eldoria's rumored riches and healing waters fueled her onward, a flickering ember against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with bizarre and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole jumps were everyday occurrences.  The vast distances between stars presented a challenge far greater than any earthly terrain; the loneliness of space, a silent pressure threatening to crush even the most hardened explorer.  But the promise of scientific advancement and the allure of the unknown propelled Ryla and her crew forward, towards the edge of the galaxy and beyond.
