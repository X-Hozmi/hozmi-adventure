
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness, a tapestry of whispering forests and treacherous mountain passes, her destination the fabled city of Zerzura, rumoured to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day was a gamble – skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, navigating by the stars – but the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, the promise of adventure a stronger pull than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of warp-core instability. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the hope of discovering new life eclipsed any peril.  The frontier beckoned, promising not just riches and knowledge but the boundless wonder of the universe itself.
