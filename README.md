
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions.  Each sunrise brings a renewed determination to push onward, fuelled by the hope that lies beyond the next horizon – a hope as vast and untamed as the landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps through treacherous wormholes and encounters with hostile alien races are commonplace.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and cosmic dangers, presents a different kind of challenge – one requiring not just courage, but advanced technology and a crew willing to risk everything for the sake of exploration and the hope of finding life beyond their own solar system.
