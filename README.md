
The year is 1347.  Dust coats my worn leather boots as I trudge across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hanging heavy in the air. My destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the legend, pushes me onward, my heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation. This journey, though fraught with peril, is the very breath of life itself.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion, a low thrum against the backdrop of star-dusted nebulae.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and unimaginable cosmic wonders.  The risks are exponentially greater than any medieval quest – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies, the thrill of discovery, and the potential to unlock the universe's greatest mysteries propel us forward, a tiny ship against the infinite expanse of space.
