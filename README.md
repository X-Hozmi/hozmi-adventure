
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the bleak, rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Robbers, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, testing her courage and resilience with every mile.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the hope that whispered in her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks demanded precision and nerve, a constant dance between the vast, unforgiving expanse of space and the fragility of her ship.  Yet, the vastness of the cosmos held a beauty that rivaled any earthly landscape, a breathtaking canvas against which she played out her own small, vital part in the grand tapestry of galactic civilization.
