
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a few coins, and a map older than herself, guiding her towards the mythical city of Ys.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the whispered legends of Ys, a city swallowed by the sea yet rumored to still hold untold treasures, fuelled her relentless trek across the land.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  He was on a mission far more ambitious than Elara's: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a rogue black hole, hoping to recover invaluable data and potentially, survivors.  Faster-than-light travel allowed him to traverse vast interstellar distances, but the dangers were equally profound – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the cold vacuum of space, made this galactic voyage an adventure of a different, equally perilous kind.
