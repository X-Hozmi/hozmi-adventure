
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of Moorish raiders and bandit gangs were ever-present, a chilling counterpoint to the songs of the cicadas. Each day brought the risk of ambushes, the gnawing hunger of insufficient rations, and the sheer physical toll of miles upon endless miles of unforgiving terrain.  Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Gran Canaria, with its promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge, propelled her onward, a tiny figure against the vastness of the Iberian landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship *Stardust* a lone speck against the cosmic tapestry.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of traversing uncharted sectors remained.  Asteroid fields posed deadly threats, rogue gravitational wells could crush his vessel, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien species kept his crew on high alert.  The mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by legends of unimaginable power.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but the path to them was fraught with peril.
