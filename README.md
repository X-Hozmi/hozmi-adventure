
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had tested them all – man and beast –  with its dense shadows concealing bandits, its bogs threatening to swallow them whole, and its unending expanse testing their endurance.  Each day brought the promise of new dangers: ravenous wolves, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and power, spurred him onward, a beacon in the oppressive darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way was fraught with perils far removed from Sir Reginald's; gravitational anomalies threatened to rip their ship apart, hostile alien patrols patrolled the hyperspace lanes, and the constant hum of the warp drive was a relentless reminder of their isolation.  Yet, the promise of the legendary Xylos artifacts – technology capable of bridging the gulf between galaxies – fueled her crew's unwavering determination, a different kind of beacon guiding them through the cosmic void.
