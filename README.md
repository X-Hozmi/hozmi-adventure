
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the crude map, its edges frayed, showing the rumored location of the lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the whispered tales of Eldoria’s untold riches fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit. Her mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional flicker of distant starships or the ominous silence of unexplored systems, held a different kind of peril than Thomas's medieval journey, but the thrill of discovery, the push into the unknown, burned with the same intensity.
