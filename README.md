
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey, transforming every hardship into a step closer to his desperate goal.  The ancient maps, cryptic and incomplete, were his only guides through the labyrinthine forests and unforgiving landscapes.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world steeped in mystery and rumored to be guarded by sentient flora.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the journey was fraught with danger; navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and bracing for unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, served as a stark reminder of the insignificance of humanity against the backdrop of the cosmos, yet it also held the promise of unimaginable discoveries.
