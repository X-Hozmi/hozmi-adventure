
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow cast by the ancient trees, fueled both her fear and her unwavering determination.  This journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was the only hope she had.

Millennia later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new home for her people.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the journey was far from easy.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed large.  But the weight of her responsibility, the hope of a better future, pushed her forward, past the nebula's edge and towards the unknown.
