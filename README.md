
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear a constant companion. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's illness, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and treacherous mountain passes test both her courage and her endurance.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – scorching deserts, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the hope of salvation fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to contain a source of energy capable of saving her dying planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the predatory K'tharr warships, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, Eva and her crew grapple with the unknowns of the cosmos.  The allure of discovery, however, coupled with the desperate need to save their people, pushes them further into the breathtaking, terrifying depths of space.
