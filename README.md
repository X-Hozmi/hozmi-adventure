The pilgrimage to Canterbury felt less a holy quest and more a grueling endurance test.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs claiming unwary travelers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every aching muscle and each shared campfire story, his resolve hardened.

The journey wouldn't just be about reaching a new planet; it would be about the unwavering spirit of exploration that propelled them across the light years.
