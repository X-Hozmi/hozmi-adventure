
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages.  Yet, the lure of the sacred shrine, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them on.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was a test of both technology and endurance.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic system failures, asteroid fields posed constant threats of collision, and the loneliness of interstellar space weighed heavily on the crew. But the potential discovery of new life, of new worlds ripe for exploration, fueled their unwavering determination.
