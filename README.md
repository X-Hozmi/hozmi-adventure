
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep in the mire.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging their homeland.  Days blurred into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering hope of salvation spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars outside blurring into streaks of incandescent colour.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates had already tested their skills and their ship, the 'Stardust Drifter', to its limits.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion, a stark reminder of the scale of their ambition and the potential rewards – or devastating consequences – that awaited them on Xylos.
