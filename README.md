
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation all stalked her across the barren expanse. The journey was arduous, but the allure of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver glint against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts flickered across her console, plotting a course through treacherous nebulae and uncharted systems.  The search for the legendary Xylos planet, said to hold the key to interstellar peace, demanded years of perilous jumps through hyperspace, encounters with hostile alien races, and the constant threat of engine failure light years from any known civilization. The vast emptiness of space held its own brand of fear, yet the promise of discovery overshadowed any trepidation.
