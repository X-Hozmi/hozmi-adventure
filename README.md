
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit-ridden passes, treacherous mountain trails, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and into the vast, unknown expanse beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic failure, asteroid fields were a constant threat, and the loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at the crew. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien worlds, and the possibility of discovering a new civilization spurred them on, their journey a testament to human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of the extraordinary.
