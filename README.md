
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she rides, the relentless sun beating down on her and her weary horse.  Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-infested Black Forest is far from over.  Each rustling leaf, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, holds the potential for danger.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, with its promise of untold riches and arcane knowledge, pushes her onward.  The sting of hunger and the ache in her muscles are minor inconveniences compared to the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian artifacts, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The jump to the next galaxy is perilous; unpredictable spatial distortions and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make each hyperspace jump a gamble. But the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel – outweighs the risks for Ryla and her crew, driving them towards the edge of the known universe.
