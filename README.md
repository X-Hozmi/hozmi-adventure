
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's worn leather boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him further into the unknown, a solitary knight against the vastness of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent hues a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps brought moments of terrifying instability, while asteroid fields demanded precise navigation and nerves of steel.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue gravitational pulls, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life. But the needs of her people, scattered across the star-strewn expanse, were a stronger pull than any cosmic threat.
