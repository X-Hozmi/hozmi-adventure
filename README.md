
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a constant test of their endurance and loyalty against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of death.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Starseeker', a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light-years of uncharted territory.  Each jump through hyperspace held a gamble – the risk of encountering unpredictable spatial anomalies or hostile alien fleets.  But the promise of finding survivors, of uncovering the mystery of the colony's disappearance, fueled her crew's courage and propelled them forward into the unknown.
