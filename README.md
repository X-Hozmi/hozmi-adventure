
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both danger and discovery. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the unwavering hope of Eldoria spurred her relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with unmapped asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse of space, a stark contrast to the vibrant alien flora that bloomed on newly discovered planets and the shimmering beauty of unexplored galaxies.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, yet the lure of discovery propelled Ava and her crew onward.
