
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely more than a deer path, wound through the dense Black Forest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine.  He was on a perilous quest, commissioned by the King himself, to retrieve a sacred relic stolen by a band of outlaws. The journey promised not only danger from bandits and wild beasts, but the gnawing uncertainty of treacherous terrain and the ever-present threat of starvation or sickness.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable hazards of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded unwavering skill and courage. The vast emptiness of space, however breathtaking, offered little comfort against the loneliness and the immense challenge of reaching a destination beyond human comprehension.
