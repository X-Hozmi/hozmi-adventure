
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward. The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, the only respite the occasional shade of a gnarled olive tree.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it offered, propelled him forward, his spirit as resilient as the ancient stones that lined his path.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, held its own brand of peril.  Solar flares threatened to fry their navigation systems, asteroid fields demanded pinpoint precision, and the vast, unknowable expanse of space instilled a constant, low-level fear.  But unlike Reginald, Eva had technology as her ally – advanced shielding, warp drives, and sophisticated sensors – allowing her to navigate the cosmic ocean, pursuing not a mythical cure, but the very future of humanity.
