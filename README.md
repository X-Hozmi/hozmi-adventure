
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Blackwood Forest had been fraught with peril.  He'd dodged marauders, forded icy streams, and navigated by the stars, his only companions the rhythmic clop of hooves and the gnawing hunger in his belly.  The promised reward – a lost relic hidden in the Abbey of St. Jude – felt both tantalizingly close and impossibly distant, each step a gamble against fatigue, starvation, and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey had been long, the hyperdrive jumps unpredictable, and the crew constantly battled system malfunctions and the creeping loneliness of interstellar space.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the possibility of encountering alien life, fueled their determination.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, both terrifying and beautiful, stretched before them, a testament to humanity's unending thirst for exploration.
