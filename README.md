
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving desert threatened dehydration at every turn.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, spurred her onward, fueled by a thirst for the unknown and the whispered promises of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets held within the oasis city.  She carried with her only a worn map, a waterskin, and a fierce determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in conventional travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of celestial wonders and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and uncharted gravitational anomalies, was a different kind of desert, a boundless expanse demanding precision, courage, and a deep trust in her aging ship's navigational systems.  The rewards, however, were potentially limitless – new worlds, new resources, and the potential to rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.
