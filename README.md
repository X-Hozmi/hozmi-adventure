
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights crested the hill, the ravaged landscape of the Hundred Years' War stretching before them.  Their mission: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death gripping their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of their supplies dwindling with every league they covered. Their journey was a tapestry woven with desperation, camaraderie, and the constant threat of death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vast distances between stars meant months of hypersleep punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the occasional meteor shower.  The true adventure, however, lay not in the journey itself, but in the uncharted territory beyond: the alien ecosystems, potential new civilizations, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile forces across the galaxy.
