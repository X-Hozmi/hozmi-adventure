
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous highlands had been unforgiving; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in a tavern tale.  Yet, the promise of the legendary Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins whispered of in hushed tones, fueled his every step.  Each sunrise painted a new vista of rugged beauty, a stark reminder of the wildness and wonder that lay beyond the confines of his known world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents was commonplace, yet the sheer scale of the cosmos always held her in awe.  The vastness of space, speckled with distant galaxies and teeming with unknown wonders and dangers, mirrored the thrill of medieval exploration, but on a scale so unimaginable it dwarfed even the most fantastical legends.
