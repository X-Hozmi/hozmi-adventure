
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched fields, brooding forests, and the occasional ominous castle spire.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought its own challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of reuniting with her brother fueled her onward, a flicker of light in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula, the swirling colours a hypnotic distraction from the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and uncharted dangers.  Alien flora and fauna painted the planets in vibrant, sometimes hostile hues.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering pirate fleets or encountering gravitational anomalies that could shatter their ship.  But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding human knowledge, eclipsed all fear, driving Jax and his crew ever further into the cosmic unknown.
