
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Elara’s horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mud.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a legendary trading hub said to hold silks finer than spun moonlight and spices that could cure any ailment.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in her quest; the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, fueled her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk’s cry, was a note in the symphony of her grand adventure across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of wormhole travel were all in a day’s work.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and alien wonders, held a different kind of peril and promise than the medieval world ever could; each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the exhilarating unknown, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity.
