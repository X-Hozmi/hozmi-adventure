
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage to find a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each sunrise, a fierce determination burned within her, fueling her onward, fueled by hope and the strength of her convictions.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the ever-present threat of space pirates was commonplace, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos a stark contrast to the dangerous reality of interstellar travel.  The weight of responsibility for the colony’s survival rested heavily on her shoulders, but the thrill of exploration and the promise of a better future spurred her on across the vast emptiness of space.
