
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable terrain threatens to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, from fording icy rivers to bartering with suspicious villagers, but the whispers of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient secrets fuel her relentless drive.  The path is long, and the dangers many, but Elara's spirit remains unbroken.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship navigates the treacherous asteroid field.  This interstellar voyage to the Andromeda galaxy is far from routine; whispers of a lost civilization and a powerful artifact beckon her forward.  Warp jumps are risky, resources are dwindling, and the ever-present threat of space pirates hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, the potential rewards – a treasure beyond comprehension and a deeper understanding of the universe – make the gamble worthwhile. The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, pushing Eva and her crew to their limits.
