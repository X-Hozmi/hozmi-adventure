
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, yet the unwavering hope for her brother's recovery spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starfire" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across a dozen uncharted planets.  Wormholes spat them out into alien landscapes – lush jungles teeming with bioluminescent flora, desolate ice planets whipped by howling winds – each a new puzzle to solve, each a test of his crew's skill and courage.  The vastness of space offered limitless wonder, but also held terrifying unknowns.
