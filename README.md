
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Kaelan's lungs as his weary steed plodded across the sun-baked plains.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, had already cost him two companions and nearly his own life.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving desert itself.  Yet, the whispered legends of Zerzura's untold riches and powerful magic spurred him onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.  He carried not only a sword and meager supplies but also the hope of a lifetime, fueling his relentless journey across the unforgiving medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The journey across the galaxy was a tapestry of breathtaking cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the weight of humanity's future rested on her shoulders, a far greater burden than any interstellar hazard.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her task and the profound gamble she was taking for the future of mankind.
