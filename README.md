
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the ochre hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried rations and a chipped map, her only companions the creak of saddle leather and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed valleys.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, yet the allure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of his ship.  Navigation through uncharted star systems required a deft hand and nerves of steel, the cosmic radiation a constant threat.  His mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize sought after by countless empires.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger than the bandits of old, but the lure of discovery burned just as brightly within him.
