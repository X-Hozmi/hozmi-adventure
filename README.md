
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, a knight errant with a thirst for glory and a battered warhorse named Bess,  journeyed across the blistered plains of Aquitaine.  Dust devils danced in the shimmering heat, the only respite from the relentless sun the occasional meagre shade of an olive tree.  He carried with him a king's decree, a perilous quest to recover a stolen relic from a shadowy brotherhood lurking in the haunted forests of the Black Mountains. Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown, a constant companion on this epic pilgrimage.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace on her trade route spanning multiple galaxies. The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a lullaby to the cosmic expanse, while the holographic star charts flickered with vibrant colours representing uncharted systems and distant civilizations. Her mission: delivering vital resources to a struggling colony on the edge of explored space, a seemingly mundane task that held the potential for extraordinary discoveries and unexpected dangers.
