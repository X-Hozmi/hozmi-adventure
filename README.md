
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had left his horse weary and himself sunburnt, but the thrill of the unknown spurred him onward.  Rumours of a hidden monastery, rumored to possess an ancient relic of immense power, had drawn him far from his homeland, across treacherous mountain passes and through dense, wolf-infested forests.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through a nebula of incandescent gas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was a gamble, but the possibility of finding new life, new resources, outweighed the risks.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was all in a day’s work for a seasoned explorer like Eva.  The vastness of space was a daunting prospect, but also a thrilling invitation to the ultimate adventure; a journey into the unknown.
