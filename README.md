
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send her tumbling, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her belly.  Yet, the whispered tales of Ys’s shimmering spires and enchanted fountains spurred her on, a flickering ember of hope in the encroaching darkness.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but also the breathtaking beauty of a land untamed and wild.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her starship.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey that would take generations to complete.  The vastness of space was both exhilarating and terrifying; the silent whisper of cosmic rays, the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes were constant reminders of the dangers inherent in interstellar travel.  But for Nova, the exploration of the unknown was a siren song, an irresistible call to push the boundaries of human knowledge and reach for the stars.
