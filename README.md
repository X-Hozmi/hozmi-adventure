
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the untamed expanse of the Ardennes Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and wilder things still.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort.  This journey to the fabled city of Ys, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril – every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow lengthening at dusk, promised a new test of courage and resilience.  The journey was as much a test of her spirit as her physical endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the nebula's swirling colours, the crimson and emerald gases a breathtaking yet treacherous backdrop to her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, a constant thrum against the silence of space, as she charted a course through asteroid fields and navigated the gravitational pull of unseen celestial bodies.  The vastness of space, a terrifying beauty, held both the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of complete and utter isolation.  The journey wasn't just about reaching Xylos, but about surviving the journey itself.
