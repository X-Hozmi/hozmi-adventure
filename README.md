
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled high in the Carpathian Mountains, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day was a battle against the elements, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  He traversed dense forests, forded icy rivers, and climbed dizzying slopes, the distant peaks a constant reminder of the immense journey ahead, a journey fueled by desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers became commonplace, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of space.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was profound, but the knowledge that her cargo held the promise of survival for countless colonists spurred her onward, a modern-day knight errant charting a course through the cosmic wilderness.
