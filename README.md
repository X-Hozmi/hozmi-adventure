
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, promised a hidden monastery beyond, a sanctuary rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – a wilderness as unforgiving as the rumors surrounding the monastery itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice against the odds of medieval life.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years towards the uncharted galaxy of Andromeda.  Unlike Elara's limited terrestrial sphere, Nova’s voyage stretched across unimaginable distances, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion against the breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders.  The risks were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions operating in the black, but the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, fueled her just as powerfully as Elara's hope had fueled her arduous trek.
