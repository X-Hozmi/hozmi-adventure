
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a stubborn defiance in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.  The journey itself, as perilous as it was, was shaping them as much as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps sent jolts through the vessel, and the ever-present hum of the engines was a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space.  Asteroids posed a constant threat, and the alien flora and fauna of uncharted planets added an element of terrifying unpredictability to the already arduous interstellar voyage. The galaxy stretched before her, an endless canvas of adventure and risk.
