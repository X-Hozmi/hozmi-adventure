
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each strained breath of her weary steed, was a testament to the journey's harshness. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandit raids, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the hope of healing fueled her onward, making each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure and survival.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and retrieve a rare isotope crucial to sustaining life on Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, navigating asteroid fields a constant gamble, and the threat of pirate attacks a chilling reality. But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the knowledge that his journey held the key to a future for humanity, made the challenges pale in comparison to the unimaginable adventure unfolding before him.
