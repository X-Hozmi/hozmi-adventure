
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he rode, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a healing balm for his ailing king.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked his every step. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a victory hard-won against the unforgiving landscape and its dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of a swirling nebula. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning human civilization.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and rogue gravitational wells; disease was replaced by the silent threat of radiation and the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each newly discovered planet a potential treasure trove of resources, or a deadly trap.  The vastness of space presented a different kind of hardship, the loneliness of the cosmos a constant companion in her intrepid exploration.
