
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the relentless journey.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier between me and my destination – the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation stalked us like wolves, yet the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of Eldoria's magic, propelled us onward.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, a fresh test of our courage and resilience.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The star-dusted canvas of the cosmos, visible through the ship's viewport, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying emptiness.  Unlike the medieval dangers of earthbound travel, our threats were cosmic – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  Yet, the vast unknown beckoned, promising discovery and perhaps, a future that surpassed even the wildest medieval dreams.
