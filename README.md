
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band crested the hill, their destination – the mythical city of Eldoria – shimmering faintly on the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and finally, into the shadow of the whispering woods, said to house creatures both magical and monstrous. Their horses, weary but steadfast, carried supplies dwindling by the day, a testament to the arduous journey, yet the glint of Eldoria's spires fueled their every step forward, a beacon of hope in a world steeped in uncertainty.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Their mission: to chart unmapped nebulae and uncover the secrets of the ancient Proxima civilization.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the brilliant spectacle of distant suns and swirling nebulas, held both wonder and peril.  The constant hum of the engines and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids provided a relentless backdrop to their exhilarating, yet precarious, interstellar expedition.
