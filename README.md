
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she rode her weary mare across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to find the lost monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the hope of finding her brother's cure fueled her onward, transforming every hardship into a step closer to her goal.  The vast unknown stretched before her, a tapestry woven with danger and the promise of redemption.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifts threatened to crush the ship, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps held the constant threat of catastrophic failure.  But the allure of discovery, the potential for finding a new home for humanity, and the vast expanse of the cosmos before her spurred Ryla and her crew onward, pushing the boundaries of human exploration into the heart of the uncharted universe.
