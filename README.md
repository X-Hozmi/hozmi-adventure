
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and whispers of plague stalked the land. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a tapestry woven with the camaraderie of fellow travelers, the sting of hunger, and the breathtaking beauty of a world unspoiled, yet unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the challenges remained: unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders operating in the lawless fringes of explored space.  Each jump to a new star system held the promise of discovery, untold riches, or catastrophic failure, a gamble Ryla was willing to take for the glory of charting the unmapped galaxies.
