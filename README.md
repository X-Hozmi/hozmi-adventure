
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King's court.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at unseen dangers – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The journey was a gamble, a fight for survival against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden perils.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and vibrant gas swirling around them.  Their mission: to chart a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was a different kind of danger, filled with rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The galaxy offered unparalleled wonder, but its beauty masked a harsh reality; survival demanded courage, skill, and a ship that could withstand the unimaginable.
