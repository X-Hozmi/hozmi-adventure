
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaks across the dusty plains.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The shimmering mirage of a distant oasis offers fleeting hope, a promise of respite before the next leg of our arduous journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, where untold riches – or perhaps only more hardship – await.  Every mile is a gamble, a testament to human resilience and the enduring allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a generation ship, cuts through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  We, the descendants of the original colonists, know only the recycled air and artificial gravity of our metal cocoon.  Tales of Earth are fading legends, replaced by the reality of navigating asteroid fields, the chilling silence of interstellar void, and the constant hum of the ship's engines.  The arrival at Kepler-186f is not just a destination, but a leap of faith into a new, uncharted future, a testament to humanity's boundless ambition to explore the cosmos.
