
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King – a plea for aid against a brutal siege.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the fate of a kingdom rested on her reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the planet Xylos, a world shrouded in mystery and whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, Ryla and her crew faced dangers far beyond any medieval knight could comprehend.  The vastness of space held the promise of discovery, but also the chilling possibility of encountering the unknown – and perhaps, the unknowable.
