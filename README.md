
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery of Saint Brigid, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their mettle, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, they pushed further, driven by faith and the allure of the unknown, their path marked by the dust of their weary horses and the stories whispered by the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the Andromeda Consortium.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all in a day's work.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored galaxies, and the promise of untold riches fueled her adventurous spirit, pushing her and her crew ever forward across the cosmic sea.
