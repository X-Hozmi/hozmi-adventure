
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored hidden monastery, a pilgrimage fraught with bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes, was far from the idyllic tales told in village taverns. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – a constant reminder of the raw, untamed power of the medieval world and the courage needed to traverse its unforgiving expanse.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval world's confined geography, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the boundless potential of the cosmos, fueled her and her crew on this interstellar voyage, a testament to humankind’s relentless pursuit of the unknown across the infinite expanse.
