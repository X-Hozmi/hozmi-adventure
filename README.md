
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travellers, crests a windswept hill.  Below, the valley unfolds – a tapestry of emerald fields and dark forests, promising both bounty and peril.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road. Yet, the lure of the distant city, whispered of in hushed tones for its legendary riches and exotic spices, pushes us onward, driven by the relentless spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My starship, the *Starseeker*, cuts a lonely path through the inky blackness, its engines a low hum against the silence of deep space.  Ahead lies Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across the galaxy.  The journey is fraught with dangers – unpredictable nebulae, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets fuels our daring voyage, a future-era adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of our medieval ancestors.
