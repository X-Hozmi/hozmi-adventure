
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at potential danger: bandits, wild beasts, or the disease itself.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her people spurred her onward, through sun-baked plains and shadowed forests, towards a distant monastery rumored to possess ancient knowledge.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy capable of solving a galaxy-wide power crisis.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory K'tharr warships, Nova and her crew faced perils far exceeding anything Elara could imagine.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, but the potential reward – a future bathed in light – fuelled their courageous journey across the cosmic sea.
