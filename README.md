The trail, a mere rutted track through the whispering wheat fields, led towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of foul weather were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the kingdom.  He carried with him only his sword, his shield, and the unwavering hope of finding glory, or perhaps, just a safe return.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational pulls, and maintaining the ship's fragile life support systems were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held the same lure of the unknown that had driven medieval explorers – the thrill of discovery, the push beyond the boundaries of the known, and the ever-present risk of never returning home.
