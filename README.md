
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each winding path presented a new peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her journey, transforming the hardship into an adventure etched in her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional means.  Utilizing experimental warp technology, Ava navigated treacherous asteroid fields and skirted the gravitational pull of black holes, the vastness of space a constant reminder of her own insignificance, yet also a testament to human ingenuity and the boundless possibilities of exploration.
