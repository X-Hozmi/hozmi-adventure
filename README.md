
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection against the biting wind, but the thrill of her quest – to find the lost monastery of Saint Seraphina – spurred her onward. Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous mountain pass, each fleeting glimpse of a distant castle, fueled her determination. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, yet the promise of adventure, of uncovering ancient secrets, overshadowed every hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, speckled with distant suns and swirling galaxies, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Hyperjumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of pirates a constant shadow. Yet, the lure of discovering new worlds, new technologies, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration, far outweighed the dangers of this interstellar odyssey.
