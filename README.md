
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse. Yet, the unwavering star in her heart burned brighter than any fear, fueled by the responsibility she bore and the unyielding promise of adventure in the unknown.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos nebula, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the grasp of the Kryll pirates, she relied on her crew's skill and the unwavering guidance of her ancient navigational charts. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted cosmic expanse, offering the thrill of discovery alongside the constant threat of annihilation.
