The trail, barely more than a deer path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each creak of his saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of potential peril – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of getting hopelessly lost.

The promise of a new world, teeming with life and untold possibilities, fueled her journey across the vast emptiness of space.
