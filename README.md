
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear; he was far from the familiar cobblestones of Oxford, deep in the untamed wilds of France on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Each day was a gamble – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any earthly crown.  His only companions were a battered map, a dwindling supply of dried meat, and the unwavering hope of reaching his destination alive.

Centuries later,  Elara's sleek starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the K'tharr Hegemony.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos and uncover the secrets of the ancient precursor civilization.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers in equal measure, testing Elara's courage and skill as she journeyed across the light-years, alone but never truly lost.
