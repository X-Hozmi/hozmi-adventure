
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a tapestry woven with sun-scorched plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  His meager supplies dwindled, but the promise of Jerusalem, of cleansing his sins and finding fortune, spurred him on.  He'd traded tales with grizzled veterans and cunning merchants along the way, each encounter adding a new thread to his incredible, perilous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, a blur of hyperspace jumps and meticulously charted star systems, was punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of subspace comms.  While far removed from the visceral dangers of Thomas's pilgrimage, Eva faced her own challenges: unpredictable stellar phenomena, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting the unknown, fueled her courage and propelled her towards the edge of the galaxy.
