Her journey from York to Constantinople was proving far more arduous than the tales of brave knights had led her to believe.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the endless expanse of farmland offered little respite from the constant threat of hunger and exhaustion.
