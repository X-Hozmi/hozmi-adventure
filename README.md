
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power, a destination promised riches and perhaps, death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a prickle of fear and excitement. Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few obstacles on his perilous journey across the breadth of the known world. His quest was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice for a better life, or perhaps, a swift and brutal end.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star system filling her viewport.  Her ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of warping across galaxies, was her home and her weapon.  The mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey demanded precise calculations, bravery in the face of uncharted space anomalies, and nerves of steel when confronting the unpredictable dangers lurking in the inky blackness between worlds.  The reward? The chance to rewrite history and bring home a lost people.
