
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and dried meats.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear hung in the air, a constant companion on her journey to the rumored monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages she passed.  Yet, the promise of healing knowledge spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainties that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch from a dozen different worlds, hummed with a nervous energy as they navigated the treacherous asteroid field.  The prize? A legendary artifact said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a technology that could bridge the vast gulfs between galaxies.  The risks were immense – pirate fleets, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted cosmos – but the potential reward outweighed the dangers in Rexa's unwavering heart.
