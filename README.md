
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the tattered map leading to the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the desert itself tested her endurance with scorching heat and treacherous sandstorms.  Yet, the whisper of legend, the lure of the unknown, spurred her onward, each step a gamble against fate.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The shimmering, ethereal clouds of gas and dust hid untold dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals to the distant planet of Aethel, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years. The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and unimaginable distances, both terrified and captivated him, a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single ship yet the limitless possibilities of the cosmos.
