
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto his face, mirroring the rugged landscape he traversed.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils as he led his small band across the treacherous Blackwood Forest, their destination a rumored lost city whispered about in hushed tones by travelling merchants.  Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  This journey, perilous yet thrilling, promised untold riches or a gruesome end.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space surrounding them.  Though technologically advanced, their journey was no less perilous.  Uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept the crew on edge. The lure of discovering new life and expanding humanity's reach, however, outweighed the dangers, fueling their relentless pursuit across the galaxy.
