
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Francia.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map older than her grandfather – a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent shivers down her spine, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked between her and salvation. The journey was perilous, but the hope of healing fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Wanderer* a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a powerful energy source rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers, Ryla relied on her wits and cutting-edge technology to survive.  The universe offered breathtaking beauty, but it was a treacherous playground where even the smallest mistake could be fatal.
