
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward.  The midday sun beat down on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire, the endless, rolling hills a monotonous backdrop to his quest. He carried a cryptic map, rumored to lead to a lost monastery holding a relic of immense power.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey, each sunrise a new challenge in this epic pilgrimage across a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna and guarded by a sentient, crystalline lifeform.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate attacks made every voyage a gamble with fate, a thrilling dance between exploration and survival in the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
