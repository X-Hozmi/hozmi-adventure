
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map, guiding her across the treacherous mountain passes to the mythical city of Eldoria. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were constant companions on her journey, testing her courage and resilience at every turn. The whispered legends of Eldoria's hidden treasures fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her starship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to galactic peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms was a daily challenge. Yet, the possibility of reuniting a lost civilization, of finding a haven amidst the interstellar chaos, propelled her across the unimaginable distances of space.
