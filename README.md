He’d left his village months ago, a pilgrim bound for Santiago de Compostela, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the unpredictable weather threatened to undo him at any moment.  Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled his steps, each landmark a testament to his resilience, each hardship a story etched into his memory. The vastness of the unknown land beckoned him on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Starseeker*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  Warp drive hummed, a constant, reassuring thrum against the cosmic silence.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, each jump a calculated risk, a dance with the unpredictable forces of space.   But the allure of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, outweighed the inherent danger, a testament to humanity's enduring spirit of exploration.
