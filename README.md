
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a stark silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, more faded prayer than guide, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient healing secrets – a desperate hope for her plague-stricken village.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the whispered legends of the monastery fueled her onward, a flickering ember against the encroaching darkness.  The journey was arduous, a test of her spirit as much as her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula, the kaleidoscopic swirls of gas and dust painting a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage. Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, a journey fraught with unknown dangers – unstable wormholes, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even her seasoned experience, a constant reminder of the immense risks and potential rewards that lay beyond the known stars.
