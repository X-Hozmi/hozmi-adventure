
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a breathtaking, unforgiving backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties gathered from distant monasteries, a mission entrusted to her by the Abbot.  Each winding trail, each treacherous river crossing, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving elements.  Yet, with every league conquered, the thrill of adventure, the possibility of planting hope in barren lands, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his course charted to a barely-mapped planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, braced themselves for the jump, a risky maneuver that could leave them stranded amongst the stars or worse. The promise of untold riches and scientific discovery, however, outweighed the danger;  the vastness of space, while terrifying, held an irresistible allure, a siren song that called adventurers to push the boundaries of human exploration.
