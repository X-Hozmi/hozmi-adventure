
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping at her worn cloak.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and magic, said to be hidden beyond the treacherous Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of adventure, but also the chilling possibility of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the mythical creatures said to haunt these remote lands. Her journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions, light-years from the crowded, resource-depleted systems of Old Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling of distant stars and the silent hum of the warp drive, instilled a different kind of awe than the medieval landscapes.  Yet, the challenges remained; treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders all posed risks as formidable as any medieval bandit.  The quest for a new home was a journey into the ultimate frontier.
