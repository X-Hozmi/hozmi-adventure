
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Before her lay a tapestry of rolling hills, the distant spires of a rumored city shimmering in the heat haze.  Her journey, begun months ago in a sun-drenched valley, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the mythical city, whispers of untold riches and ancient secrets, kept her pushing onward, her resolve hardened by each hardship faced.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos IV a stark contrast to the cold, sterile gleam of her starship.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from a derelict research station orbiting the planet, a task complicated by Xylos's volatile atmosphere and the whispers of a sentient, energy-draining entity said to inhabit the station’s decaying corridors.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Ryla had technology on her side—advanced scanners, reinforced armor, and a crew ready to face the unknown—but the sense of intrepid exploration, the thrill of venturing into the uncharted, remained the same.
