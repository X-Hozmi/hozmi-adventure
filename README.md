
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel containing only a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and a tattered map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for both breathtaking discovery and terrifying peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a testament to the courage and resilience required to chase a medieval dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships was a daily challenge, demanding split-second decisions and a mastery of hyper-drive technology far beyond the capabilities of any medieval traveler.  The vastness of space, filled with both wonder and unimaginable danger, mirrored the spirit of adventure that had driven explorers for millennia, merely reshaped for a new age of galactic exploration.
