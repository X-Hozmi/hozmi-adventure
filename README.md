
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely a path through the unforgiving Breton countryside, offered little comfort.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the encroaching forest.  Yet, the lure of the mythical Isle of Avalon, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and castles, propelled him forward, a beacon in the twilight of his life's ambition.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a quest for glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and dealing with the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were mere inconveniences compared to the promise of discovering a new world, a new beginning for humanity, a reward beyond the wildest dreams of medieval knights.
