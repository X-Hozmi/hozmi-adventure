
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only respite the occasional shade offered by stunted oaks.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla adjusted the chrono-compass on her wrist.  The swirling nebula of Xylos painted the viewport in vibrant hues, a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: a diplomatic voyage across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and encompassing countless alien worlds.  Navigating treacherous wormholes and evading hostile pirate factions were just part of the routine. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of peril; the isolation, the unknown, the sheer scale of the universe itself tested her courage and resolve more than any physical danger.
