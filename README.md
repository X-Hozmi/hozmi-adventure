
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the setting sun.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the whispered legends of Eldoria’s healing power, fueled their weary bodies and steeled their resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey for habitable planets, a critical step in humanity’s desperate search for a new home after Earth’s catastrophic collapse.  Warp drives hummed, navigating the treacherous cosmic currents, and the vast, breathtaking beauty of the universe both exhilarated and terrified her crew.  Each jump across light-years brought the possibility of new discoveries, but also the potential for unforeseen dangers lurking in uncharted space – alien entities, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any form of rescue.
