
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King, a perilous journey undertaken alone across treacherous mountain passes and lawless plains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the whispers of plague that stalked the land were a more terrifying threat than any brigand.  Survival depended on wit, courage, and the unwavering loyalty of her faithful steed.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, punched through the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Facing cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravity wells, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, Rexa and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, a constant gamble against the odds in their relentless pursuit of the galaxy’s secrets.
