
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  Each mile brought him closer to his goal, but also closer to exhaustion, his determination fueled by hope and the weight of his people's suffering.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, contact was lost decades prior.  Faster-than-light travel offered speed, but not safety; rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets made each jump a gamble.  The weight of responsibility rested heavy, but the lure of discovery and the possibility of reunion spurred her across the cosmic ocean, each jump a step closer to a destiny unknown.
