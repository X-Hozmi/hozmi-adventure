
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a desperate dream.


Centuries later,  Captain Elara's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking slightly against the gravitational pull of distant suns.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate attacks from the Kryll Confederacy, and deciphering ancient alien technology were all part of a typical day.  The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable riches, making each jump to a new star system a breathtaking gamble with the fate of humanity.
