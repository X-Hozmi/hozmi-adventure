
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a new vista unfolded, each encounter, however harsh, offered a glimpse into the vibrant tapestry of medieval life, fueling her spirit and driving her ever closer to her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the journey across the Orion Arm to the Andromeda Galaxy still demanded weeks of careful calculations and course corrections.  The thrill wasn't merely in reaching the distant star systems, but in the breathtaking views – swirling cosmic dust, the birth and death of stars, and the silent majesty of planets orbiting suns unlike her own.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery always outweighed the risks.
