
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of Moorish raiders and the ever-present threat of bandits kept her vigilant, but the lure of the legendary city of El Dorado, rumored to lie beyond the mountains, fueled her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, was a potential challenge, a test of her courage and resourcefulness in this unforgiving landscape.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of adventure, of discovery, outweighed the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his course charted towards the unexplored Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with swirling cosmic dust and distant starlight, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks were daily occurrences, but the potential discovery of new life forms and untapped resources made the risks worthwhile.  This was not a journey measured in leagues, but in light-years – a voyage into the unknown, fuelled by human curiosity and an unquenchable thirst for the next frontier.
