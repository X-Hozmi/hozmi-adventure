
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the hill, the sun glinting off their battered armor.  Before them stretched the vast, untamed expanse of the Carpathian Mountains, a treacherous path to the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold a powerful artifact.  Each step was a gamble, with bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain all posing threats.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria's secrets, and the glory awaiting a successful return, spurred them onward. Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril and hope, each sunrise a new chapter in their epic adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unknown dangers.  Warp jumps took them across unimaginable distances, each one a leap of faith across the cosmic void.  The galaxy, a boundless expanse of wonders and perils, awaited their exploration.
