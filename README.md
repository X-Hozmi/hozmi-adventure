
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather boots of Sir Kaelan as he urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood lingering from the recent skirmish.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest, where whispers of malevolent creatures haunted the twilight. Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits, storms, starvation – but the glimmer of hope, the legend of the Sunstone, kept him pushing forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and secure a vital energy source.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable cosmic weather were commonplace hazards. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, but the drive to succeed, to find Kepler-186f and ensure humanity's survival, fueled her journey through the galaxy.
