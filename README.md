
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in stolen jewels, a price placed on her head by the very same king she'd robbed.  Bandits, highwaymen, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions on this desperate journey to the coast, a perilous voyage fueled by a desperate need for freedom.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, or death.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his course charted for the distant Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the unknown hazards of hyperspace always held a thrill.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadowy fringes of known space, and uncharted planets offered both unimaginable riches and deadly alien encounters. This journey, a quest for a legendary artifact said to hold the key to interdimensional travel, was a gamble, a cosmic roll of the dice for glory, fortune, and possibly, oblivion.
