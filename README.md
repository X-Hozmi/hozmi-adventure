
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of Francia in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey to reclaim the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre was proving far more perilous than the whispers in court had suggested. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the obstacles they faced.  Each creak of their worn saddles, each strained breath, was a testament to the relentless adventure unfolding before them.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of the nebula tested the limits of the ship's ancient engines. The cosmos, vast and indifferent, held both wonder and danger in equal measure, a stark and beautiful reminder of the immense risks and untold rewards of interstellar exploration.
