
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, each sunset the gnawing worry of dwindling supplies.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, promising both sanctuary and unknown dangers. We are bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey measured not in miles, but in the sweat of our brows, the stories shared around crackling fires, and the ever-present shadow of fate.  The whispers of Genghis Khan still echo across these lands, a reminder of the vast and unpredictable nature of this medieval world.


Centuries hence, the colossal starship *Odyssey* leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is a symphony of humming engines and recycled air, punctuated by the breathtaking views of nebulae and distant star clusters visible from the observation deck.  While free from the immediate threats of bandits, we face the chilling reality of interstellar travel: the ever-present risk of equipment malfunction, the isolation of deep space, and the unknown dangers lurking on an alien world—dangers far exceeding those faced by our medieval predecessors.
