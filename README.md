
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost empires.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, yet the lure of discovery burned brighter than any hardship. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and the gnawing uncertainty of whether Zerzura was myth or reality.  He rode on, spurred by a hope as vast as the unknown lands before him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the rumored Xylossian artifact, a technological marvel capable of faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony were child’s play compared to the unknown dangers lurking within the nebula itself. But Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, pushed onward, driven by a thirst for exploration and the promise of a scientific breakthrough that could reshape the future of humankind.  The vast emptiness of space held both immense peril and unparalleled wonder.
