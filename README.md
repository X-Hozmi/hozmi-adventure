
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, laden with silks and spices destined for the frozen north.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes blanketed in snow, and the ever-present threat of disease.  We navigated by the stars and the whispers of weary travelers, our progress measured not in miles but in the resilience of our companions and the dwindling supplies in our wagons.  The promise of untold riches in Novgorod spurred us onward, a glittering prize at the end of a long and perilous road.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My ship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  cuts a path through the nebula of Antares, its engines humming a lullaby against the backdrop of a billion shimmering suns.  We are explorers, mapping uncharted systems, seeking habitable worlds across vast gulfs of space.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards – new life, new resources, new knowledge – make it all worthwhile. The universe is vast, and the adventure is only just beginning.
