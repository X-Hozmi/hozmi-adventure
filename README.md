
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues. His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Aldhelm from the treacherous Black Mire, a journey rumored to be fraught with brigands, mythical beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – and perhaps, death.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment fragile as his hopes, and pressed on, the spirit of chivalry burning bright against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was child's play compared to the challenges of traversing wormholes and deciphering alien signals.  Each jump into hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.  But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering something truly extraordinary, fueled her journey across the galaxy.
