
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her grizzled companion, Silas, traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Carpathian Mountains.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding the cure for Silas's ailing daughter, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving weather threatened hypothermia, and the ever-present gnawing hunger was a companion as relentless as the mountain peaks themselves.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, treacherous paths clinging to cliff edges, and the chilling whispers of local legends about creatures lurking in the shadows.

Centuries later,  Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey through uncharted asteroid fields and potentially hostile alien territories.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle, but the loneliness of interstellar space, the constant threat of engine failure, and the unnerving silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship's systems, created a different kind of terror.  Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
