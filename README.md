
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty track as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up clouds of ochre dust.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had already claimed two men to fever and thirst.  Each sunrise brought the daunting prospect of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, yet the glint of gold in the whispered tales spurred them on, a beacon in the harsh landscape of their medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a mesmerizing tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, held both wonder and peril.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made this interstellar voyage a constant test of skill and nerve, a high-stakes adventure among the stars.
