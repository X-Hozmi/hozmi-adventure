
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested her resilience. Yet, the whispers of miracles and the unwavering faith in her heart fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of another day closer to her sacred destination.  The vastness of the land felt both daunting and exhilarating, a testament to the enduring human spirit's capacity for adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained.  Uncharted wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept her crew on edge.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey promising untold riches and knowledge, but fraught with the unknown perils only the vast emptiness of space could offer. The scale was incomprehensible, yet the human desire to explore, to push boundaries, burned just as brightly as it had in Elara’s time.
