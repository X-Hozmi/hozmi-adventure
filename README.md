
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred him on, a burning ember in his heart, fueled by tales told around crackling fires and the desperate hope of finding fortune and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant stars, held a different kind of peril; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of a new dawn for humanity, of a future blooming on alien soil, outweighed the risks, a beacon guiding her through the perilous darkness between worlds.
