
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the unpredictable whims of the land itself.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope burning in her heart outweighed the fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and unknown celestial anomalies made this journey no less perilous than Elara's. But unlike Elara, Eva had the technology of advanced sensors and faster-than-light travel – still, the unknown dangers of interstellar space kept her alert and her determination unwavering.
