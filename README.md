
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey from York to Constantinople was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and a new test of her resilience. The whispered tales of exotic spices and far-off empires fueled her onward, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across lightyears to the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating; the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion to the breathtaking vistas of alien planets and celestial wonders. While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – the spirit of adventure remained the same, a burning desire to explore the unknown corners of the universe, pushing the boundaries of human endeavor.
