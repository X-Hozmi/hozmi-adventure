
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Auvergne.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint-Guilhem, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her courage, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering hope of reunion spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, unpredictable darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the existential dread of the infinite expanse of space were mere inconveniences compared to the weight of her responsibility. The vastness of the cosmos held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, steeled by her training and fueled by hope, pressed onward towards the unknown future.
