
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  A worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, guided her westward, towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils that lay between her and her ambition, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the capricious nature of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the ancient whispers of hyperspace navigators.  The vibrant colors of distant planets painted the viewport as she jumped between star systems, each destination a new challenge, a new culture, a new trade route.  While pirates and rogue AI posed dangers far removed from the dusty trails of Elara's era, the vastness of space held an equally potent threat: the lonely, isolating expanse of the cosmos and the unknown terrors lurking in the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
