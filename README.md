
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried with him a king's pardon, a pouch of meager coin, and a burning desire to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk circling overhead, held the promise of peril – bandits, starvation, disease – but the lure of the unknown pushed him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape, a lone figure against the vast expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a signal their only guide through the unimaginable distances between stars.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational forces of black holes, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  But the potential rewards – a new home for humanity, knowledge beyond imagining –  fueled their daring journey across the vast, star-dusted canvas of the galaxy.
