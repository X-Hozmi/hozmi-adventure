
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a warning of impending war from a distant, hostile kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for banditry, or worse.  The journey was fraught with danger, a constant test of endurance against both the elements and the unknown terrors lurking in the shadowed forests and across the treacherous mountain passes.  She relied on her wits, her courage, and the kindness of strangers encountered along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the volatile planet of Kael.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and dealing with the bureaucratic nightmares of interstellar travel were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of alien worlds and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies, presented a different kind of danger, yet one as thrilling and perilous as any medieval adventure.
