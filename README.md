
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape, their journey a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Their destination, a rumored haven across the sea, felt as distant as the stars, yet the flickering hope within their hearts, fueled by whispered legends of a promised land, kept them moving.  Their adventure was not one of glory, but of sheer survival, a brutal test of endurance against a backdrop of medieval hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy teeming with unexplored planets.  Unlike the medieval travelers before her, Rexa navigated using sophisticated star charts and faster-than-light engines, yet the risks remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure presented a different kind of peril.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, shared a common thirst for discovery, venturing into the cosmic unknown, charting new worlds, and facing the vast, breathtaking wonders – and terrifying unknowns – of the universe.
