
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the whispers of a mythical city, lost to time but said to hold unimaginable riches, spurred her onward. The perilous journey tested her resilience, each sunrise a new challenge against the vast unknown, a constant dance between survival and the seductive lure of the legend.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and warping through spacetime were commonplace hazards on her interstellar trade routes.  The cargo hold, brimming with exotic bioluminescent flora from Kepler-186f, paled in comparison to the thrill of charting unmapped sectors and the ever-present danger of pirate raids.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, was a canvas upon which Ryla painted her own daring legend, one jump across the galaxies at a time.
