
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just supplies; it holds the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing marriage.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a reminder of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every sunrise, she pushes onward, fueled by a stubborn determination to reach the distant shores of the Mediterranean, a world unknown but brimming with promise.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirate fleet, Ryla and her crew face cosmic horrors and technological challenges unimaginable to medieval travelers.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, is a constant reminder of their isolation, a stark contrast to the human connection that fuels their unwavering quest for discovery.
