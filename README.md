
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Steppe, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of bustling market towns left far behind.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of St. Jude, a journey fraught with peril – bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear that his destination – a remote monastery shrouded in legend – might prove a fool's errand.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-lost research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva relied on her wits and the cutting-edge technology of her ship.  The vast, uncharted expanse of space, teeming with both wonder and danger, held the promise of untold riches – or utter annihilation.
