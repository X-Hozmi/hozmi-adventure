
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was proving far more perilous than the tales had promised.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very terrain itself seemed determined to thwart his progress. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising a different valley and perhaps a safer path, fueled his weary legs and spurred him onward towards the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Vance navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star system dominating the viewport of her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields threatened to pulverize her vessel, pirate factions lurked in the shadowy sectors between known systems, and the unpredictable nature of warp jumps always held a hint of the terrifying unknown.  But the promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a new beginning for humanity, was a siren song strong enough to overcome any fear.
