
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hangs in the air, a promise and a threat. Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, is fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the unforgiving landscape tests her endurance at every turn.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – a treacherous river crossing, a hostile encounter with a band of mercenaries, the constant gnawing hunger – but the lure of Eldoria, and the secrets it holds, pushes her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of pulsars is commonplace. The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, relies on each other as they face the unknown, their shared goal – the discovery of Xylos – the only beacon in the infinite darkness.
