
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan's small band pressed onward. Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland, was fraught with peril.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving elements. Yet, the glint of steel in Kaelan's eyes and the unwavering hope in his heart spurred them forward, their horses' hooves pounding a rhythm against the unforgiving earth, each step a testament to their desperate quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted galaxies after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers, Eva relied on her wits and the advanced technology of her starship, a tiny speck of courage amidst the vast, indifferent expanse of space. The fate of millions rested on her shoulders, a burden she carried with stoic determination as she charted a course into the unknown.
