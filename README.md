
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey, each hardship forging his resolve.  He carried with him not only a worn map and a dwindling supply of dried meat, but also the burning hope of finding fortune and a better life, a hope that fueled his every step across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.

Yet, she pressed on, driven by the same spirit of adventure that had propelled countless explorers before her, a yearning to push the boundaries of human knowledge and conquer the vast, uncharted territories of the galaxy.
