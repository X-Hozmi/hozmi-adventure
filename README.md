
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's weary band crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed hope, the camaraderie forged in hardship a balm against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The promise of the holy city, and the tales spun around crackling campfires, fueled their relentless progress.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of its celestial storms a far cry from the earthy grit of Reginald's path.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and defying the very constraints of time.  While the dangers were different – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, the crushing loneliness of deep space – the spirit of adventure remained the same: a relentless pursuit of the unknown, driven by a thirst for discovery and the unwavering human desire to push beyond the boundaries of the known.
