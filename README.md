
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and herbs; it contained the secrets of a lost alchemist, whispered promises of untold riches hidden within a crumbling monastery nestled deep in the forbidden forests beyond.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuelled both her fear and her relentless ambition – for the road ahead held danger, but also the intoxicating possibility of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson gas swirling around the sleek lines of his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a secret coveted by empires across the known galaxies.  The journey was fraught with peril – pirate raids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and hostile lifeforms.  But for Jaxx, the allure of pushing the boundaries of space, of unlocking the universe's mysteries, overshadowed any fear.
