
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, the unpredictable weather threatened starvation, and whispers of a plague stalked the land. Yet, each sunrise brought the promise of new vistas, the camaraderie of fellow pilgrims, and the unwavering conviction that her pilgrimage would cleanse her soul.  The rough-hewn path was her destiny, each step a testament to her courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic K'tharr pirates, Eva relied on her crew's diverse skills and cutting-edge technology to overcome the immense distances and cosmic hazards.  The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable opportunity; the galaxy itself was their canvas, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
