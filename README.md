
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the earth.  Their quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, dense forests teeming with unseen dangers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the lost city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled their weary bodies and spurred them onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the inky blackness of the void.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for humanity’s expanding reach.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the isolation was profound.  Weeks stretched into months, punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the distant, swirling beauty of nebulae.  The potential dangers were far greater than any medieval knight ever faced, ranging from rogue asteroids to unknown alien lifeforms lurking in the shadows of uncharted planets.  But Eva, like Kaelan before her, was driven by a thirst for the unknown, a relentless spirit that propelled her across the vast expanse of space.
