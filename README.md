
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onwards.  Dust billowed behind them, a swirling brown cloud marking their passage across the unforgiving plains.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged Kaelan's homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their arduous journey, pushing them ever closer to their elusive destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable planets for a humanity desperately clinging to survival.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, fraught with the risk of spatial anomalies and pirate attacks.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced the unknown with courage and unwavering determination.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also the chilling reality of their isolation – a tiny vessel adrift in an ocean of stars, their future uncertain yet brimming with the promise of discovery.
