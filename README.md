
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held not just food and water, but a king's ransom in smuggled spices, a desperate gamble to save her family from ruin.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air, yet the glint of distant mountains fueled her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each strained muscle, was a step closer to freedom.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across light-years of treacherous space.  Cosmic storms raged outside, threatening to tear her vessel apart, while the alien fauna of Kepler-186f posed a silent, lethal threat. Yet the potential cure for a galaxy-wide plague spurred her on, each hyperspace jump a leap of faith toward salvation.
