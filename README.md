
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril and the thrilling uncertainty of what lay ahead – a stark landscape of breathtaking beauty and brutal hardship, mirrored only by the unwavering fire in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all in a day’s work. The vast, awe-inspiring panorama of the cosmos provided a counterpoint to the claustrophobic reality of the ship, its metallic shell a tiny bubble in an infinite ocean of stars.  The thrill of exploration pushed her onward, a constant reminder that the greatest adventures lie beyond the known.
