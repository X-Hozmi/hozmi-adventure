
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the relentless journey.  The chill wind whipped across the plains of France, biting at my exposed skin as I guided my weary horse.  Ahead lay the rumored riches of the East, a siren's call echoing through tales of exotic spices and fabled cities.  Bandits, disease, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions, but the lure of the unknown spurred me onward, a thirst for adventure outweighing every fear.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, not the wind.  Stars blurred into streaks of iridescent light outside the viewport as we jumped between galaxies, chasing whispers of a lost civilization on the fringes of known space. Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted darkness.  The risks were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirates – but the thrill of exploration, the tantalizing prospect of uncovering something truly extraordinary, remained the same primal force driving me forward.
