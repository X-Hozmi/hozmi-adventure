
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, a cacophony of smells and sounds a far cry from the quiet, sun-drenched fields of Provence we left behind. Now, weeks into our trek eastward, the air is thick with the dust of countless caravan trails.  We’ve traded the gentle sway of a sailing ship for the relentless pounding of hooves and the creak of our overloaded wagons.  Each sunrise brings new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the promise of the fabled Silk Road, of exotic spices and untold riches in the distant East, keeps our weary spirits high.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion.  We’re weeks into our voyage between galaxies, the star-strewn canvas of the cosmos stretching endlessly before us.  The crew navigates by constellations invisible to the naked eye, charting a course through nebulae of breathtaking beauty and terrifying gravity wells.  The risk is not bandits or disease, but warp storms that threaten to tear our ship apart, and the chilling silence of the void itself, a stark contrast to the vibrant, albeit chaotic, life we left behind on Xylos.  Still, the allure of the Andromeda galaxy, whispered of in ancient legends and now within our reach, fuels our relentless journey.
