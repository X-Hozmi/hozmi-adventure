
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, chafed her shoulders.  Each rustle in the tall grasses sent a shiver down her spine, a reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next rise – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising the legendary city of Eldoria and the rumored cure for her ailing brother, spurred her onward.  This perilous journey, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, was a pilgrimage fueled by love and desperate hope.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking panorama of swirling colours and distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the potential for encountering hostile alien fleets or encountering unpredictable spatial anomalies. Yet, the promise of discovering a new, habitable planet for her people, a refuge from the dying world they left behind, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmos.  The adventure was immense, the stakes impossibly high.
