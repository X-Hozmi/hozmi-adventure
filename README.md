
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and disease stalked the muddy roads.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a swollen river to ford, a treacherous mountain pass to navigate, the constant gnawing fear of starvation or worse. Yet, the whispered promises of salvation spurred her onward, the rhythm of her horse's hooves a counterpoint to the beating of her own adventurous heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling of distant suns, held both wonder and terrifying unknowns.  Asteroids, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies tested the ship's systems and her crew's nerves.  But Eva, fuelled by a thirst for discovery that echoed Elara's centuries before, pressed on, her eyes fixed on the infinite possibilities that lay beyond the known cosmos.
