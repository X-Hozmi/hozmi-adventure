
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating famine.  Each day brought fresh challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing threat of starvation. But the glint of Ys’s rumored gold, and the hope of salvation for their people, fueled their arduous journey across the unforgiving land.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, the *Hope*, believed to have vanished near the black hole at the galaxy's edge.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Eva and her crew faced perils far beyond anything their medieval counterparts could imagine. Yet, the allure of the unknown, and the potential for groundbreaking scientific discoveries, spurred them across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
