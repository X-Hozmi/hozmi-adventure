
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked path towards the rumored city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, held the potential for banditry or worse.  The whispers of djinn and monstrous beasts lurking in the shadowed canyons fueled her fear, but the promise of unimaginable riches, and the escape from her arranged marriage, spurred her onward.  Her worn map, a family heirloom, was her only guide through this unforgiving landscape, its faded ink the only constant in her uncertain journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rex "Nova" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a breathtaking spectacle, hid the dangers of rogue asteroids and the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  His hyperdrive hummed a steady rhythm, a counterpoint to the ever-present anxieties of interstellar travel; the vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifyingly lonely, held him captive in its ethereal embrace.
