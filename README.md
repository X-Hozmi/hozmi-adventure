
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion against her threadbare cloak.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each wary glance at the shadowed valleys, was a testament to the peril and promise of the journey. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were less daunting than the sheer scale of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking, yet alien, landscape. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  The dangers were different now – treacherous wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of uncharted space – but the thrill of the unknown, the burning desire to explore the vast expanse of the cosmos, remained the same, a constant companion on her interstellar voyage.
