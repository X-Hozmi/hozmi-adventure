Sir Kaelan, his squire Thomas trotting beside him, squinted at the setting sun. Their quest – to deliver a sacred relic to the faraway monastery of St. Elara – had led them through whispering forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the bustling, slightly dubious, company of traveling merchants. Each day brought new challenges, from skirmishes with bandits to navigating confusing trails, but the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged on the road, fueled their weary bodies and unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space. The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been flawless, but the journey to the Kepler-186f system, a new colony struggling against hostile indigenous lifeforms, was far from over.  Eva's crew, a diverse band united by their shared thirst for exploration and the promise of a new frontier, faced down meteor showers, navigated treacherous asteroid fields, and constantly monitored their ship’s systems, their adventure a blend of scientific precision and audacious daring against the overwhelming backdrop of the cosmos.
