
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his armour clanking, urged his weary horse onward.  Their quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland – led them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and finally, to a shimmering oasis in the heart of the unforgiving desert.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, from sudden sandstorms to the ever-present threat of raiders, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its alien beauty a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of medieval travel, the vastness of space presented its own terrors: rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations.  The journey was a lonely one, but the promise of discovery kept Elara and her crew pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
