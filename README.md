
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, while the relentless sun threatened dehydration.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the sacred city, the whispered promises of divine grace, spurred them onward, their battered armor gleaming faintly under the unforgiving sky.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the burgeoning colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump through hyperspace was a brutal, disorienting experience, leaving her crew nauseous and exhausted. But the breathtaking vistas of alien galaxies, the vibrant colours of uncharted nebulas, were a worthy reward.  The true adventure lay not just in the journey, but in the countless unknowns that awaited them on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with both wonder and potential danger.
