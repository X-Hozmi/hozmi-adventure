
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Black Forest, shadows lengthening with the approaching twilight.  He carried the King's writ, a dangerous mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Prague.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of nervous energy through him.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the perils facing him on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of nearby stars tested her skills to their limits.  The vast emptiness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, amplified the solitude of her mission – a search for habitable worlds amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.  Her journey was a pilgrimage not of land, but of starlight.
