
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rough-hewn map clutched in his gauntlet.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, the hope of salvation, fueled his weary bones and spurred him towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the starving colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space held dangers far greater than any medieval knight could imagine, but Eva's determination, fueled by the potential to save lives across the galaxy, burned brighter than any distant star.
