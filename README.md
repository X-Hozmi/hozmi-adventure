
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we press on, the scent of sweat and roasting lamb heavy in the air.  Each day brings the risk of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city whispered to be paved with gold and brimming with exotic spices, fuels our onward journey; a testament to the human spirit's relentless pursuit of the unknown, even when faced with hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship capable of warping through space-time, navigates the swirling nebula of Cygnus X-1.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from a dozen worlds, races against an approaching stellar storm while charting a course to a newly discovered planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  The challenges are different - radiation bursts, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown beyond known space - but the spirit of adventure remains the same: a burning desire to push boundaries and uncover the breathtaking wonders that lie hidden amongst the cosmos.
