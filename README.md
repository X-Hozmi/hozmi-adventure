
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread, a chipped waterskin, and a worn map – a lifeline in this chaotic time.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey to the fabled city of Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by hope and a desperate need for a new life. Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, both thrilling and terrifying.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reminder of the colossal distances separating her from home, a home she might never see again.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling unpredictable spatial anomalies were all part of a galactic explorer’s life.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and deadly, offered a different kind of adventure, a lonely struggle against the indifferent majesty of the universe.
