
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The King's ransom, a heavy chest strapped behind his saddle, bounced with every jarring step.  Robbers, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked him on his arduous journey from Prague to Constantinople. Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the wary eyes of strangers in every village.  His adventure was a perilous dance with fate, a test of endurance and courage across a vast, unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable power rumored to exist on a remote, uncharted planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien maps, her journey was one of breathtaking vistas and terrifying unknowns.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and deadly, offered endless possibilities for discovery, but also the constant threat of annihilation light years from any known civilization.
