
Sir Reginald, his surcoat dusty and patched, spurred his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth, the only respite the occasional shade of a stunted oak.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the stolen Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy embrace of the Whisperwind Forest, where goblins and worse lurked in the tangled undergrowth. Each day brought new perils, testing his courage, his skills, and the endurance of both man and beast.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission, to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, demanded navigation through asteroid fields the size of small moons and hyperspace jumps that warped reality itself.  Alien encounters, both hostile and benevolent, were common occurrences, and the constant threat of system malfunctions kept her crew on high alert.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before them, a testament to humanity's relentless drive for exploration.
