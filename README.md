He'd left his village seeking fortune, or perhaps just escape, and the journey across the vast, unpredictable landscape was proving far more treacherous than he'd imagined.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions, each a test of his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, the swirling nebula of Xylos painting vibrant hues across her viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel were the challenges she faced, all overshadowed by the immense wonder of discovering new worlds and the possibility of encountering other life forms.
