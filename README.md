
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the relentless journey across the French countryside.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood that occasionally drifted on the wind – a grim reminder of the banditry that plagued the roads.  Every creaking cart, every flickering campfire, held the promise of both sanctuary and danger.  My destination:  the distant city of Avignon, its rumored wealth a beacon in the harsh landscape, a gamble against starvation and worse.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light years away that held the promise of a new beginning for humanity. Unlike the muddy tracks of my ancestor's era, the star-strewn expanse was a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns. The danger now was not bandits but cosmic radiation and the unpredictable nature of uncharted space. Yet, the allure of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, fueled my journey, a modern echo of the medieval adventurer’s perilous quest.
