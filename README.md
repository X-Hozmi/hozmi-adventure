
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome was a perilous one, fraught with bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new landscape to navigate – a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, fear, and unwavering determination to reach the Pope’s holy city.  He carried with him not only his meager possessions, but the weight of a sacred vow, a promise whispered on his breath with every labored step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and dark, empty voids, held a different kind of danger, one of cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the silent, ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to chart unmapped territories across the galaxy, fueled her journey, a quest as daunting and exhilarating as any medieval pilgrimage, but with stars as her guideposts instead of crumbling cathedrals.
