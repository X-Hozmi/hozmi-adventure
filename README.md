
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the distant spires of Carcassonne a shimmering mirage in the heat.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a priceless illuminated manuscript, entrusted to her by a dying abbot.  Bandits, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation were the constant companions on her perilous journey across the French countryside, a journey fueled by faith, courage, and a desperate hope to reach her destination before the winter snows fell.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a testament to the raw, untamed adventure of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant colours of nebulous clouds painted a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage, but the peace was deceptive.  Pirate attacks were a constant threat, wormholes lurked unseen, and the malfunctioning hyperdrive threatened to strand them light years from civilization.  Jaxx, a seasoned explorer with a reputation for daring, relied on her crew's expertise and quick thinking to overcome the myriad dangers of traversing the vast expanse of space, a journey far removed from the medieval world yet equally defined by risk, resilience, and the unwavering human spirit of adventure.
