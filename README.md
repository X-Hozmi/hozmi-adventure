
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, squinted at the setting sun.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him and his small band across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests haunted by rumour and bandit, and finally, to the edge of the Whispering Moors.  Their quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, a relic said to hold the power to heal the ailing King. Each day was a gamble against the elements, against hostile lords and wilder beasts, but the promise of glory and the King's salvation spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity.  The journey was a perilous dance with gravity wells, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  But Elara, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, was undeterred. The vast unknown beckoned, promising untold riches and discoveries for a brave new era of exploration.
