
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered prophecies and the desperate need for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another league conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations in slower ships.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking gently against the currents of space.  Ava navigated asteroid fields, evaded pirate scavengers in derelict cruisers, and faced the chilling isolation of deep space. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion, a reminder of the immense scale of her adventure and the precariousness of her mission.
