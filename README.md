
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onwards, his heart pounding with the rhythm of his steed's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were all part of the journey.  But the promise of unlocking the galaxy's secrets, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fueled her courage, a thrill of discovery echoing the ancient knights' quests in a new, cosmic frontier.
