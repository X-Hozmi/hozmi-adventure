
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of untold power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and cunning, a new step closer to a destination that might only exist in legend. The journey was arduous, but the lure of the unknown fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Zydonian civilisation on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, and navigational charts flickered on the console, guiding her through uncharted cosmic territories teeming with unpredictable celestial phenomena and potential dangers.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held a constant undercurrent of risk; a single malfunction could mean oblivion.  But the promise of discovery, of contact with a species entirely unlike humanity, spurred her on across the unimaginable distances between stars.
