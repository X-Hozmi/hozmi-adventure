
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical Sunstone city.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Yet, the allure of the legendary city, and the whispers of untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, untamed landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a system of uncharted planets after a catastrophic warp-core failure decades prior.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger – the unknown, the unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the hope of finding survivors, and perhaps uncovering the secrets of Xylos's advanced technology, fueled her journey through the cosmic unknown.
