
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the path was choked with mud and treacherous bogs, and the constant threat of starvation loomed larger than any knight.  Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred them on, a promise of divine grace and untold stories awaiting at journey's end. Each creak of their worn saddle, each shared loaf of bread, forged a bond stronger than any steel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers, Elara and her crew faced dangers far beyond those of any medieval knight.  Their courage was tested not by bandits but by cosmic anomalies and alien intelligences, yet the lure of discovery, the desperate hope of finding a lost civilization, propelled them across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
