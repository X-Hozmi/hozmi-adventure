
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map whose creases mirrored the worries etched onto her face.  She was bound for Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by a desperate hope of finding her brother, lost amongst the ranks of the mercenary companies crisscrossing Europe. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of peril – bandits, disease, or simply the sheer brutality of a world where survival was a daily struggle.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing question: would this be the day that led her to him, or to her own end?


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  cut through the nebula's shimmering gases.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with its own unique dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the black between stars.  But Ryla, steely-eyed and determined, navigated the cosmos with the same grit and resilience as her medieval ancestor,  driven by a quest for knowledge that transcended the boundaries of time and space.  The vast emptiness held both wonder and terror, a mirror reflecting the boundless human spirit’s yearning to explore the unknown.
