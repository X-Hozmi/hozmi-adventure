
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, her loyal steed, a swaybacked mare named Luna, struggling alongside.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed canyons, rivers rage unchecked, and the whispers of plague follow them like a phantom.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, a test of endurance and faith, but the allure of the sacred city, the hope of redemption, fuels their weary steps.  The vast, unpredictable landscape is both their enemy and their canvas, a tapestry woven with sweat, fear, and unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma navigates the shimmering nebula of the Cygnus X-1 system.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of faster-than-light travel, leaps between galaxies, charting unmapped territories and facing cosmic horrors unimaginable to medieval travelers.  The dangers are different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and sentient, hostile alien races – but the spirit of adventure remains the same: a thirst for the unknown, a daring to push boundaries, and an unwavering belief in the power of human (or, in this case, human-adjacent) ingenuity to conquer the seemingly impossible vastness of space.
