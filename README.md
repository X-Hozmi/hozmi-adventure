
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray I'd left behind days ago at the coast.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a whispered legend among travelling merchants. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies were my constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred me onward, my heart pounding a rhythm against the relentless march of the journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, soothing drone.  Vast nebulae, swirling colours beyond human comprehension, painted the viewport as we jumped between star systems.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, shared my restless energy, fuelled by the chance to rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.  The dangers were far removed from bandits and mountains – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms were a far more perilous challenge. Yet, the allure of the cosmos, the boundless possibilities of discovery, was a force even stronger than the fear of the vast unknown.
