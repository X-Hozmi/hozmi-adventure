
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of overcoming adversity, spurred him onward, his heart filled with a yearning for adventure only a medieval journey could inspire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immensity of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking vistas of swirling cosmic dust and newborn stars, but the journey was fraught with peril – unstable wormholes, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  Despite the dangers, the allure of exploration and the hope of finding Xylos fueled her journey across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
