
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving terrain.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst.  Yet, the whispered stories of Zerzura's shimmering spires and healing waters fueled her weary spirit, pushing her relentlessly forward into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, the risk of encountering rogue gravitational fields ever-present.  But the potential for discovery –  new life, new technologies, the answers to humanity's oldest questions – outweighed the dangers.  Eva, gazing out at the swirling cosmic canvas, felt the weight of responsibility and the thrill of the unknown, a familiar echo of the medieval adventurers who'd charted terrestrial seas before her.
