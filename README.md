
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of oxen and weary men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of the plague that stalks the land. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of unimaginable riches and exotic spices, pushes us onward.  The dust-choked wind whispers tales of distant cities and ancient wonders, fueling our resolve despite the hardship and the constant uncertainty that defines travel in this brutal, beautiful age.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust. Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk against navigational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. We seek not spices or silks, but knowledge – the secrets held within the ancient ruins of forgotten civilizations on planets scattered across the Milky Way and beyond. The vastness of space is terrifying and exhilarating, a relentless adventure against a backdrop of unimaginable scale.
