
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each day brought its own peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of adventure, spurred them on, their resolve strengthened by camaraderie and the hope of glory.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' a sleek starship navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the distant Kepler-186f colony, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with dangers unseen.  Asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel tested both her skill and her courage.  But Eva, seasoned veteran of countless interstellar voyages, embraced the challenge, her gaze fixed on the distant glimmer of her destination – a new world waiting to be explored.
