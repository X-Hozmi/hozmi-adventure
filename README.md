
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Zerzura, a city shimmering like a mirage in the desert's heart, spurred him onward, fueled by hope and a desperate longing for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, charting unexplored star systems and seeking out habitable planets.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the daily grind.  Yet, the vast expanse of space, teeming with uncharted wonders, beckoned, promising discoveries that would reshape the future of humanity.
