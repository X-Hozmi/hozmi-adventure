His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.

She navigated asteroid fields, evaded pirate ships, and faced the chilling silence of desolate planets, all while yearning for the familiar warmth of Earth and the promise of discovery that lay hidden amongst the countless stars.
