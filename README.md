
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, swallowed the sounds of their small company.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential harbinger of death or discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony demanded nerves of steel and precise calculations.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held both unimaginable wonders and the ever-present danger of cosmic radiation, rogue black holes, and hostile alien encounters.  The galaxy was their frontier, and every jump to hyperspace a gamble with fate.
