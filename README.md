
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating dense forests, fording raging rivers, and bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages – yet the lure of Zerzura, and the whispered promise of its untold riches, kept him pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems in the void were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, but also the constant threat of unforeseen cosmic phenomena and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The potential rewards, however, outweighed the risks for Eva and her crew.
