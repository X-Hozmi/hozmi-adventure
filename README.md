
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind whipping at her cloak.  Her worn map, a testament to countless journeys, offered little comfort against the looming storm clouds.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and untold riches, or perhaps only a cruel mirage in the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and promise that defined her arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigation relied less on ancient maps and more on sophisticated astrogation, but the thrill of discovery remained the same. The vast, inky expanse of space, punctuated by the distant gleam of galaxies, held both wonder and terrifying unknowns.  The success of her mission, the future of humanity itself, hung in the balance with every jump to hyperspace.
