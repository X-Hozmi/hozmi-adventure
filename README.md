
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains crimson.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager supplies and a tattered map, guiding her toward the mythical Sunstone city whispered about in taverns.  Each day brought peril; bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed. Yet, the promise of adventure, the yearning for something beyond her humble village, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his course charting a path through unmapped star clusters.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a familiar lullaby, a stark contrast to the vibrant alien landscapes flashing past his viewport.  His mission: to recover a lost artifact from the ruins of a long-dead civilization on the planet Kepler-186f.  The galaxy held infinite wonders and dangers, but for Rexx, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover the unknown, was a siren song he couldn't resist.
