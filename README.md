
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three sturdy packhorses trudge through the mud, the scent of woodsmoke and rain clinging to their worn cloaks. Their journey from York to the Holy Land is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, rivers swell unpredictably, and the very air seems to whisper tales of plague-ridden villages. Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering gleam of Reginald's resolve, fuelled by faith and a thirst for adventure, burns brighter than the distant sun.  Their destination awaits, a land promising both glory and untold hardship.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  While the dangers are less tangible than brigands and disease – gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the scale of the unknown is exponentially greater.  Elara's mission: to chart the planet, a potential new home for humanity, and to brave the mysteries that lie within its unexplored landscapes.
