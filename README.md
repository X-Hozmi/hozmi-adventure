
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the Pyrenees, a daunting barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Compostela.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this pilgrimage, a perilous adventure fueled by faith and a desperate hope for healing. Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for thrilling discovery or terrifying demise.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, had been fraught with temporal distortions, but the breathtaking view from the cockpit – a kaleidoscope of nebulous colours and distant galaxies – made the risk worthwhile.  Their mission: to establish a foothold amongst alien flora and fauna, charting unknown territories light-years away from the familiar comfort of Earth.  The vastness of space offered limitless possibilities, but also held dangers unseen, making every voyage a gamble on the future of humanity.
