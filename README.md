
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to find the legendary Sword of Aethelred, rumored to be hidden within a forgotten monastery nestled in the Carpathian mountains.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but small inconveniences compared to the glory – and perhaps survival – that awaited him. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating by the stars to bartering for meager rations in squalid villages.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unknown celestial phenomena and the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers.  While the comforts of her starship vastly differed from Reginald's primitive caravan, the thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility, and the sheer uncertainty of the void remained a constant.  The cosmos, like the medieval world, demanded courage, resilience, and an unwavering spirit of exploration.
