
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked track across the plains.  Her mule, laden with meager supplies, struggles against the relentless wind.  This journey to the distant monastery, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother, is a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  Each sunrise brings fresh challenges, but the hope of reaching her destination fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerian pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly, unknown predators.  Jax navigates asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, the vast expanse of space a stark contrast to the close-quarters camaraderie of her crew.  The galaxy's mysteries beckon, promising both glory and oblivion in equal measure.
