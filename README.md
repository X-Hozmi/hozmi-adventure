
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a waterskin dwindling with each passing hour, and a heart brimming with the reckless hope of reaching the mythical city of Eldoria. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the legendary treasures and forbidden knowledge rumored to await her.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, "Stardust Drifter."  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as he plotted a course towards Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from his homeworld.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable danger; asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of warp travel were constants on his perilous journey, each moment a gamble against the cold, indifferent universe.  The quest for a new home, a new beginning, fueled his every decision.
