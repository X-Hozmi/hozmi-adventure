
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary destrier onwards.  The chill wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape of the Scottish highlands, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards of his homeland.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Cuthbert – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed dens of outlaws.  Each day was a gamble against starvation, ambush, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the gleam of the holy grail fueled his determination.  He was a lone knight, facing the vast unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare energy source vital to the survival of the Sol Federation.  Navigation charts pulsed with data streams, guiding her through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies.  The loneliness of space, however, was a different beast than any Reginald had faced; a suffocating silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of comms.  The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas painted in cosmic dust and starlight, both thrilled and terrified her, each jump to hyperspace a gamble on the fabric of spacetime itself.
