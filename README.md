
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept plains. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the hope of glory, spurred them onward, their determination as sharp as their swords.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped between galaxies, a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was fraught with peril – unstable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant hum of anxiety that came with venturing so far from known space.  But the promise of discovery, of connecting with humanity's forgotten past, fueled her voyage across the galactic sea.
