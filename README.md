Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a chipped map, but her heart held the promise of adventure:  reaching the fabled city of Seville, rumored to hold secrets whispered only in hushed tones amongst travelling merchants.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, fueled her determination to overcome the treacherous paths, bandits, and unpredictable weather that lay between her and her destination.


Thousands of years later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey that would take generations of crews.  But Ryla, fueled by a thirst for the unknown and the legacy of countless explorers before her,  was eager to face the challenges of navigating uncharted space, battling unpredictable asteroid fields, and encountering the potential wonders (or dangers) of alien civilizations far beyond human understanding.
