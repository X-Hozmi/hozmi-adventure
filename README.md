
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudges onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of ancient power, propel him forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across multiple galaxies.  The journey is fraught with peril – navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and confronting the alien landscapes of uncharted planets.  But Elara, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, is undeterred. The hope of finding her missing ancestors, and the boundless expanse of the cosmos, fuels her relentless pursuit across the unimaginable distances of the galaxy.
