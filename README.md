
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little comfort against the looming peaks and unpredictable weather.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a place of untold riches and even more dangerous secrets, a destination worth risking everything for.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – or death.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, a beacon of hope in a vast, unforgiving galaxy.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, clung to their dreams of discovery despite the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, hostile alien species, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The journey was perilous, but the promise of new worlds spurred them onward.
