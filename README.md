
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of sweating horses and dust-caked faces, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the rumored city of Eldoria. Whispers of untold riches and forgotten magic fuel our journey, a perilous trek through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes. Each sunrise brings the threat of ambush, each sunset the gnawing hunger of the endless road.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the familiar, keeps our weary spirits aloft.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, my starship, cuts a gleaming path through the Andromeda Galaxy, its destination a newly-charted planet teeming with strange, vibrant life.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines between the vast distances, but the adventure remains.  The thrill of discovery, the unknown dangers lurking in unmapped nebulae and the potential for breathtaking encounters with alien civilizations – these are the fuels that drive us across the cosmic ocean, pushing the boundaries of human exploration to unimaginable horizons.
