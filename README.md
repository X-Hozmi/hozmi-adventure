
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones across taverns and marketplaces, fueled his relentless journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape. He traveled through kingdoms and across harsh deserts, his resolve hardening with each passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the colonized planet of Kepler-186f.  Navigation through uncharted star systems, dodging asteroid fields and battling the occasional space pirate, was all in a day's work. The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, dwarfed even the grandest terrestrial journeys.  Yet, the pressing need to ensure the survival of the Kepler colony, and the thrill of exploring the unknown, propelled her onward, a solitary voyager in the grand cosmic ocean.
