
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Zaragossa, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – yet the glimmer of hope fueled her onward, a stubborn ember against the encroaching darkness.  The road was a tapestry woven with hardship, but also unexpected kindnesses offered by strangers in crumbling villages and bustling market towns.

Centuries later, Captain Jax's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet void between galaxies.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos cluster, rumored to hold a source of energy capable of powering a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the grasp of K'tharr pirates, Jax and his crew faced perils unimaginable to the medieval traveler.  Yet,  the vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty, offered a different kind of hardship – the lonely expanse of empty stars, the crushing weight of isolation light-years from home, a solitude far exceeding any experienced by Elara on her earthly journey.
