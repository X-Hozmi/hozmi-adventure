
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked them like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording raging rivers, and bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages.  But the lure of the holy city, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal strain on both ship and crew, the constant warp jumps a nauseating dance between reality and the hyperspace void.  But the vastness of space held its own allure, a tapestry of shimmering stars and unexplored worlds. The possibility of finding survivors, of bridging a galactic divide, made the risks worthwhile.
