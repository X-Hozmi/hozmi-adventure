
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her caravan trudge across the sun-baked plains.  Their destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown fuels their weary steps, a shared dream bolstering them against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The whispering wind carries tales of both wonder and despair, shaping their journey into a tapestry woven with hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a dwindling human population.  Faster-than-light travel allows for breathtaking journeys across nebulae and past pulsars, but the vastness of space holds its own dangers.  Uncharted wormholes threaten to tear their vessel apart, while hostile alien civilizations present a different kind of threat.  The weight of humanity's future rests on Eva's shoulders as she navigates this cosmic odyssey, charting a course through the unknown towards a new dawn, or possibly, an unforeseen abyss.
