
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s horse stumbled, its hooves sinking deep into the mire.  Their journey across the vast, unforgiving plains of  Francia was proving far more perilous than anticipated.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, while the relentless sun beat down, threatening dehydration.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold untold riches and powerful magic, fueled their weary steps.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours swirling around them like a cosmic ballet.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  The journey was fraught with danger – unstable wormholes, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes, and the hope of finding a new home spurred them onward, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
