
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the palpable sense of danger, a constant companion on this arduous journey across the treacherous lands separating her village from salvation.  Wolves howled in the distance, a chilling reminder of the perils that lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. The hyperdrive hummed, a low thrum against the deafening silence of space, as Ryla navigated through asteroid fields and nebulae of impossible beauty.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos planet, said to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The vast expanse of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable discoveries, but also the ever-present risk of encountering unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms in the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
