The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, was a far cry from the royal court he'd left behind.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – a magical creature whose very existence was whispered in hushed tones.

Exploration was in her blood, a legacy passed down from generations of spacefaring pioneers.  The unknown beckoned, promising not only scientific discovery, but also the thrill of charting a course into the unmapped expanse of the cosmos.
