
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them ever forward into the heart of the untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her cockpit. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, and alien constellations wheeled past, as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields and navigated the bureaucratic minefield of intergalactic travel.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of her small place within the cosmic ocean.
