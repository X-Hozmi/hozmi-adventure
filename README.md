
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains fiery red.  Her quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing village.  Bandit trails and treacherous passes were her constant companions, the chilling whispers of mountain spirits a more frightening prospect than any brigand. Each day brought a new test of her endurance, a new breathtaking vista, and a deepening understanding of the vast, unforgiving, and ultimately beautiful world around her.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission, far removed from Elara's humble goals, was to locate a lost colony on the edge of explored space, a whispered rumour of technological marvels and untold dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the perilous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a gamble.  The universe held endless wonders, but survival demanded constant vigilance and unwavering courage.
