
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory in her quest for the ancient secrets whispered on the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic gas and stardust.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling crippling radiation storms was all in a day's work for a galaxy-hopping mercenary, but the allure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown fueled his insatiable thirst for adventure amongst the stars.
