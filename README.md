
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, the treacherous crossings of swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the challenges facing him.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast distance yet to cover.  His only companions were his worn leather-bound map and the unwavering loyalty of his aging warhorse.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a crucial artifact from the derelict mining station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates were commonplace, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the potential for encountering unknown, hostile alien life forms.   The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, served as a constant reminder of her isolation and the immense risks involved in her interstellar journey.
