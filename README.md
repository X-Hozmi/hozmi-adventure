
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary mule across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fuels her relentless journey.  The camaraderie of her fellow travelers, a grizzled knight and a sharp-tongued merchant, offers solace against the harsh realities of the road, binding them together in a shared pursuit of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  His mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the dangers are no less real.  Pirate raids, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space test the crew's resilience.  The vastness of the galaxy, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, holds both promise and peril, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of their chosen path.
