
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the Languedoc.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed each sunrise. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the camaraderie forged around crackling campfires with fellow travelers, and the whispered legends of miraculous cures at the cathedral spurred her onward, each hardship a badge of honor earned along the arduous path.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies for the Terran Federation.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying; wormhole jumps were unpredictable, alien encounters potentially hostile, and the loneliness of deep space a constant companion.  But the thrill of discovery, the possibility of encountering new life, and the unwavering belief in humanity's potential to reach for the stars fueled her relentless exploration across the cosmic ocean.
