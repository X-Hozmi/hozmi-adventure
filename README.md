
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess a potent healing balm.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brings a fresh wave of apprehension and excitement.  Wolves howl in the distance, bandits are a constant threat, and the path itself is a treacherous labyrinth, but the thought of reaching her destination fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through the cosmic dust.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating; alien encounters are as likely as navigational hazards, and the unknown promises both unimaginable riches and certain death.  But for Rexx, the thrill of exploration far outweighs the risks.
