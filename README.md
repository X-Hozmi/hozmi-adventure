
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost Sunstone, had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest, where whispers of werewolves and vengeful spirits clung to the air like the clinging dampness. Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, the gnawing hunger, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of glory, propelled him forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated efficiency of her ship.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope*, lost somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks from the Kryll, and the ever-present threat of spatial distortion. But the hope of finding survivors, of bringing them home, fueled her determination as she navigated the vast emptiness between the stars, a solitary explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
