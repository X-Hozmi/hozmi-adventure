
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he spurred his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless, rolling fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest, a perilous journey to the Holy Land to retrieve a sacred relic, had already claimed two of his companions to fever and bandit raids.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a jolt of fear and anticipation through him, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lurked around every bend in the muddy track.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was of faith.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in subjective time but only weeks for her cryogenically frozen crew. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of uncountable stars, was a different kind of wilderness, just as treacherous and awe-inspiring as the medieval lands her ancestors had traversed. The real dangers lay not in bandits but in unforeseen celestial events, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving void.
