
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail was treacherous – a muddy track barely clinging to the side of a windswept mountain pass.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones in taverns, a place of untold riches and unimaginable dangers. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all companions on this arduous journey, testing the limits of his courage and endurance.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of anticipation down his spine.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey was fraught with peril; asteroid fields threatened to shred her ship, and the unpredictable gravitational forces of black holes lurked in the inky blackness.  But the promise of new life, of uncharted worlds teeming with unknown flora and fauna, fueled her relentless pursuit. The vast emptiness of space both terrified and exhilarated her, a stark contrast to the cramped confines of her ship’s bridge.
