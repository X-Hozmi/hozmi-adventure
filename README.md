
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and a worn prayer book.  This journey to the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold wealth, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the harsh terrain tested her endurance at every turn. Each sunrise brought a renewed hope, tempered by the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as she charted a course through unmapped galaxies, seeking the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f.   While the dangers were different – treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration burned as brightly as the distant stars. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, mirrored the daunting beauty of Elara's medieval journey.
