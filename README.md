
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth distorted the distant silhouette of the mountains, their peaks promising both shelter and unknown dangers.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged abbey of St. Jude, led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous river crossings, and past villages ravaged by plague. Each day brought new challenges, testing not only his physical endurance but his courage and cunning against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable temporal distortions of hyperspace was all in a day's work. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held the promise of incredible discoveries, but also the ever-present threat of the unknown, a danger far greater than any earthly bandit or plague.
