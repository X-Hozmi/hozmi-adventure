
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel holds a map, its creases mirroring the lines etched on her weathered face.  She's not traveling for riches or glory, but for knowledge, seeking out the legendary lost library of Alexandria whispered to exist somewhere beyond the Pyrenees mountains.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, speaks of potential peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the allure of untold stories keeps her pushing onward, her spirit unbroken.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate ships are child's play compared to the existential dread of the unknown. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, stretches endlessly around her ship, a constant reminder of her audacity and the potential for glorious discovery, or catastrophic failure.  Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.
