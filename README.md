
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones amongst the desert tribes, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in canyons, mirages played cruel tricks on the eye, and the endless expanse of sand threatened to swallow her whole. Yet, the glint of rumored gold and the promise of untold secrets spurred her onward, a flicker of determination burning brighter than the desert sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the allure of the uncharted Andromeda galaxy was too strong to resist.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of ending the intergalactic war. With each jump through hyperspace, the risk increased, but the potential reward, a lasting peace, outweighed any fear.
