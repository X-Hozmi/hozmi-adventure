
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the ochre hills in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to be working for a distant lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the vastness of the journey, the sheer thrill of the unknown, fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The galaxy stretched before them, an infinite expanse of glittering stars and perilous cosmic phenomena.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-vigilant patrols of the Kryll Empire, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration, their courage matched only by the breathtaking beauty and terrifying power of the cosmos.
