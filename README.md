
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, reminding him of the dangers lurking beyond the next bend: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest, to reach the distant Holy City of Jerusalem, felt as vast and unending as the forest itself, a journey measured not in miles, but in sweat, hardship, and the unwavering hope of divine grace.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense distances traversed, and the technological marvel that made such journeys possible.  Yet, the vastness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, and potentially hostile, alien civilizations.  Her mission, a quest for a new home for humanity, demanded courage, skill, and a steadfast belief in the future.
