
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than her hopes.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, had lured her from her village, a gamble against starvation and bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and untold riches, a constant dance between fear and thrilling anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and silent, deadly voids, held a different kind of danger than Elara's mountains.  Here, the threat was not bandits, but radiation storms and rogue asteroids, the gamble not of gold, but of unlocking the secrets of the universe itself.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push beyond the known, burned as fiercely in Ryla's heart as it had in Elara's.
