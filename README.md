
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the rumors that haunted his journey – rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing an ancient artifact capable of healing the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and promise, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where bandits and treacherous terrain were far greater foes than any mythical beast.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been treacherous, pushing the ship’s hyperdrive to its limits.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a long-lost colony, a journey fraught with the dangers of uncharted space – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows between the stars.  The vastness of space offered stunning vistas, but every breathtaking nebula was a potential graveyard for the unwary.
