
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a whisper of gold and forgotten magic.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the uncharted, pushed her onward.  Each sunrise was a gamble, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the vast expanse of space a canvas of vibrant colours and cosmic wonders. Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates.  The sleek starship was their home, the crew their family, and the infinite stars their destination – a future written not in parchment, but in the constellations themselves.
