
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, crested the hill.  Before him stretched the vast, untamed wilderness separating him from the promised aid of King Edward.  Days bled into weeks as he navigated treacherous bogs, skirted hostile bandit camps, and forded raging rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush and starvation, but the hope of reaching his king, of fulfilling his sworn oath, spurred him onward through the unforgiving landscape.  The scent of woodsmoke in the distance finally offered a glimmer of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking but dangerous backdrop.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth and fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Eva, fuelled by scientific curiosity and a fierce determination, charted a course through the cosmic unknown, her crew relying on their skill and technology to navigate the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
