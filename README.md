
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights crested the hill, the sun glinting off their battered armour. Before them lay a seemingly endless expanse of rugged terrain, the path to the Sultan's hidden city a treacherous ribbon snaking through perilous valleys and across unforgiving mountains.  Rumors of unimaginable wealth and ancient magic fueled their arduous journey, each day a battle against the elements, bandits, and their own dwindling supplies. The thrill of discovery, however, spurred them onward, the whispered legends promising glory beyond measure.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vastness of space a stark contrast to the medieval landscapes of old.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets, Eva and her crew faced dangers far exceeding those of any earthly terrain. The weight of the galaxy rested on their shoulders, the hope of millions hanging in the balance with each hyperjump into the unknown.
