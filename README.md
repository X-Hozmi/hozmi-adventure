
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – vital grains for a village ravaged by famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk overhead, is a pulse of adventure in a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Yet, the hope in her heart fuels her onward, a burning ember against the chill of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vast expanse of the cosmos is her playground, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against gravitational anomalies and unknown alien threats.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but light years.  The thrill of discovery, the camaraderie of her crew, and the sheer wonder of unexplored planets propel her forward, even when facing the chilling possibility of cosmic loneliness.
