
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Each creak of the saddle, each sting of the sun, fueled her determination.  Her quest: to reach Constantinople, a fabled city shimmering like a mirage on the horizon, to deliver a vital message that could prevent a devastating war.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the allure of adventure, the hope of fulfilling her sworn duty, spurred her onward through the heart of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers, and battling the cosmic storms that raged between galaxies tested his skills and the ship's endurance.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable danger and the promise of breathtaking discovery, a true adventurer's paradise in a future far removed from medieval journeys.
