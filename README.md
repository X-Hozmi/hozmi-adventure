
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, trudged onward.  The relentless sun beat down on his back as he and his small band of companions crossed the desolate plains, their destination the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each step brought the risk of bandits, wild beasts, or the treacherous terrain itself, but the lure of adventure, the whispered promises of glory and fortune, pushed them relentlessly forward, a tiny human speck against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the expanding nebula decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars, Eva and her crew faced the cosmic unknown, their sleek starship a fragile vessel against the awe-inspiring, potentially fatal, immensity of space. The thrill of discovery, the chance to rewrite history, fueled their journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
