
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, guided his weary horse across the dust-choked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the unforgiving terrain tested both man and beast. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whisper of legend, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space.  The journey was fraught with peril, navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling unpredictable gravitational anomalies. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast unknown. Yet,  the cosmos, in all its terrifying beauty, held a magnetic allure, a siren song that called to her adventurous spirit.
