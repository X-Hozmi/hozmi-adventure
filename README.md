
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but with every mile, her resolve hardened, fueled by faith and the whispered legends of the saints that guided her path.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her controls.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, lifeforms. But Ava, like Elara before her, felt the pull of adventure, a desire to push boundaries and explore the uncharted territories that called to her from the stars.
