
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged King before winter's grip choked the land.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the burning hope of success and the whispered legends of the fabled city of Eldoria fueled his onward journey, transforming every hardship into a challenge worthy of a knight's mettle.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the dying star of Kepler-186f, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational fields and the constant threat of space pirates.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and awe-inspiring, each passing planet a tantalizing mystery waiting to be explored.  But the thought of her crew and the life-saving technology aboard the ship propelled her through the cosmic expanse, driving her on towards the perilous but essential mission.
