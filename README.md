
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a battle against the biting wind that whipped across the desolate plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier between me and my destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for my brother's plague.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements, but the hope of salvation fueled my weary limbs, pushing me further along the treacherous path.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting thrum.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant color as we jumped between galaxies, the vastness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a nebula teeming with unpredictable energy storms and hostile alien life.  Navigating the cosmic currents, battling space pirates, and deciphering ancient star charts were all part of the perilous journey, but the potential discovery of a long-lost civilization made the risks worthwhile.
