Each rocky outcrop held the potential for bandits or worse – wild beasts prowling the unforgiving landscape.  Her destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable wealth.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the sting of frostbite, the exhaustion of relentless travel, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, but the allure of the journey, the chance to overcome impossible odds, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging solar flares were just part of the daily grind.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold, hard reality of malfunctioning engines and dwindling supplies, constantly tested her crew's resilience.  Yet, the promise of discovering new life, charting uncharted territories, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled their relentless pursuit of the unknown.
