
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, entrusted to her safe passage to Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air. Each creak of the mule's harness, each rustle in the dry grass, heightened the tension of her perilous journey, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers and breathtaking beauty of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos system, Ryla relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced AI to avoid catastrophic collisions.  The vast emptiness held both unimaginable wonders – nebulae painted across the cosmos in vibrant hues – and terrifying unknowns; rogue planets, uncharted wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Their mission, to recover a lost artifact from the edge of known space, demanded courage, precision, and an unwavering belief in the boundless potential of interstellar exploration.
