
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey from York to Jerusalem was a tapestry woven with hardship: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to their resilience.  The tales of exotic lands and holy relics fueled their quest, a potent elixir against the despair that threatened to engulf them on this arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been a gamble, a desperate bid to find a new home for her people.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems was a daily affair, a constant test of her skill and courage.  Yet, the breathtaking views of nebulae painted across the void, and the promise of a future beyond the dying embers of their own solar system, made the risks worthwhile.
