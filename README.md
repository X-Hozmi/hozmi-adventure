
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the rutted dirt road.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of horse was punctuated by the ever-present threat of bandits, unpredictable weather, and the gnawing hunger in our bellies. Our destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. The journey was arduous, fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown fueled our onward push, each sunrise a promise of both danger and discovery.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of folding space, hummed beneath our feet as we hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and traces of ancient civilizations.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of system failure. Yet, the potential rewards—the discovery of new worlds, the expansion of human knowledge—outweighed any fear.
