
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread and a chipped flint, but her heart was full of a different kind of bounty: the hope of reaching the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees, a place said to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery – the very essence of her medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, star-dusted silence of interstellar space.  Ahead lay the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, the risk of encountering alien life – both friendly and hostile – a cosmic adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of her medieval forebears.
