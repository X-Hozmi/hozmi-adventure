
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The chill autumn wind whipped across the vast, empty plains of Francia, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and fear.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village – felt increasingly hopeless. Each sunrise revealed a landscape both breathtaking in its wildness and terrifying in its potential dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs swallowing the unwary, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His journey was a brutal testament to human resilience, a desperate gamble against the odds.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, stretched before them.  Navigation charts were unreliable, wormholes unpredictable, and the threat of pirate raiders a constant shadow. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, fueled her crew's determination.  The vastness of space, while daunting, held the promise of untold wonders, a siren song only a true explorer could resist.
