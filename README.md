
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons,  and the whispering sands held secrets best left undisturbed.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce water, and relying on the kindness (or indifference) of strangers in isolated villages.  Her heart pounded not just from the exertion, but from the thrill of the unknown, the intoxicating lure of the legendary city shimmering on the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and enduring weeks of solitary hypersleep were all part of the routine.  But the potential rewards – discovering a new Eden amidst the cosmic dust – fuelled his unwavering determination, pushing him ever deeper into the infinite black.
