
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains of Aquitaine a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a fresh wave of determination washed over her, spurred on by whispered tales of miraculous healings and the unwavering faith that fueled her arduous trek across the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the low thrum of anxiety; navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a constant battle against the unforgiving vastness of space.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning for humanity amongst the stars, made the risks worthwhile, a different kind of adventure altogether.
