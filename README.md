
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a testament to countless torn edges and faded ink, offers little comfort against the biting wind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens her senses, for the whispers of bandits and the shadows of wild beasts are ever-present companions on this perilous journey across the kingdom.  She carries a secret, a vital message, and the fate of her people rests on her reaching her destination, a monastery hidden deep within the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm as erratic as the ship's hyperdrive.  Galaxies stretch out before her, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and hidden dangers.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential human colony, is fraught with peril - rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of space.  But the promise of a new life, a chance to escape the dying embers of Earth, fuels her resolve to brave the vast, uncharted territories of the cosmos.
