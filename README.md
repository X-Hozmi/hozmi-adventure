
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues. Her quest: to reach the legendary Isle of Avalon, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness.  Yet, the whispered tales of Avalon's magic spurred her on, fueling her resolve with a potent blend of hope and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a perilous undertaking requiring navigation through asteroid fields and the potential encounter with hostile alien life.  The vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant alien flora and fauna that unfolded before her scanner.  Each jump across the galaxy was a leap of faith, a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable thirst for discovery that transcends time itself.
