
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her hand resting on the pommel of her father's sword.  The map, brittle with age, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, a place rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine – the whispers of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the harsh, unforgiving landscape filled her days. Survival, not sightseeing, was the focus of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* cutting a path through swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Ahead lay the treacherous gravitational pull of a black hole, and behind, the relentless pursuit of the Kryll mercenaries.  While the dangers were of a different nature, the thrill of exploration and the weight of responsibility remained constant – the universe was a vast and unpredictable ocean, and Jax was a lone ship sailing its treacherous currents.
