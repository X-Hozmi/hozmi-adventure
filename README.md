
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim their lives, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each day brought new challenges, from fording raging rivers to bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies.  But the allure of Eldoria's fabled Sunstone, and the glory awaiting the knight who secured it, spurred them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was routine; the real danger lay in the unpredictable gravitational forces within the nebula and the mysterious energy signatures emanating from the planet itself.  The vastness of space, a cold, indifferent expanse, held both wonder and terrifying unknown dangers in equal measure.
