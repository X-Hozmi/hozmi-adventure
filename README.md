
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map promising riches – or ruin – in the far-off city of Toledo.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the allure of adventure, the chance to escape her village's stifling poverty, fuels her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential story, a test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of infinite cosmos. His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of warp-core failure. Yet, the promise of discovery, the tantalizing glimpse at the unknown, keeps his crew focused, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and inspiring, a testament to human ambition and the enduring quest for the next horizon.
