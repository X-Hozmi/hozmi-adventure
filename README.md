
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, crested the hill.  Below, the sprawling city of Avignon shimmered under the afternoon sun, a beacon after weeks traversing the treacherous Rhône Valley.  Each mile had been a gamble – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the unpredictable whims of weather, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the city's rumored wealth and the promise of adventure, whispered in tavern tales and sung by wandering minstrels, had fueled our dogged persistence. The journey had tested our mettle and forged bonds stronger than any castle wall.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebula before them, plotted a course through the Andromeda galaxy.  This wasn't a simple trade run; this was a voyage into the unknown, a search for the legendary Xylos system and its whispered promise of advanced technology.  The risks were exponentially greater – hostile alien encounters, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any known civilization. Yet the allure of discovery, the chance to chart unmapped territories, far outweighed the peril.  The galaxy awaited.
