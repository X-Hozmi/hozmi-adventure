
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary in the distant lands beyond the Pyrenees. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse. Yet, with every sunrise painting the rugged hills a fiery orange, her resolve hardened, fueled by the yearning for a future beyond the shadows of her past.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by the cosmic void decades ago.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant reminder of the immense distances separating her from home, a home that felt both incredibly distant and achingly close.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, held both profound beauty and unimaginable peril, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.
