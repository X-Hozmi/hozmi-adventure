
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's ragged band of knights trudged across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia. Their mission, a desperate pilgrimage to Constantinople to secure a desperately needed alliance, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling ruins, and the endless expanse of the steppe held its own silent threats – thirst, starvation, and the ever-present risk of a sandstorm swallowing them whole.  Each creak of their worn saddles, each strained breath, was a testament to the relentless hardship of their medieval journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, unpredictable wormholes spitting them out light-years from their intended course.  Alien pirates, with their devastating plasma weaponry, were a constant threat, and the sheer vastness of space pressed in, a suffocating reminder of their isolation. But the promise of discovery, of finding the lost colonists, fueled their courage, driving them onward through the unforgiving expanse.
