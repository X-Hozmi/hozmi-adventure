
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and dried meats.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a lost monastery brimming with forgotten lore, or perhaps a chance encounter with a wandering knight. The uncertainty of the road was her constant companion, a thrilling counterpoint to the familiar rhythms of her journey towards the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold secrets older than the kings themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting a breathtaking backdrop to her intergalactic voyage.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, peppered with the twinkling chaos of distant galaxies, held a different kind of thrill than Elara's medieval journey.  Here, the dangers were cosmic – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life.  Yet, the pursuit of knowledge and the exploration of the unknown burned bright within Eva, mirroring the spirit of her ancient ancestor, Elara, on her own quest across the medieval world.
