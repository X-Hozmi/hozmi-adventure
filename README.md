
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of Francia a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. But the lure of the unknown, the promise of glory and discovery, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration, driven by the same indomitable spirit that propelled Elara across the medieval world – the insatiable thirst for adventure.
