
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a landscape of whispering grasses and ancient, gnarled oaks.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and arcane knowledge.  Each day brought new challenges – perilous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown fueled his weary bones, driving him further into the heart of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were constant companions.  But Eva, steeled by years of training and fueled by the hope of discovery, navigated the treacherous cosmic currents.  The vastness of space, a terrifying yet exhilarating expanse, held the promise of unlocking humanity's destiny amongst the stars.
