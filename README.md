
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary steed as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies were mere inconveniences compared to the relentless gnawing fear of failure. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival, pushing her ever closer to her perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Nebulae swirled like cosmic paint strokes outside the viewport as her ship jumped between galaxies, the destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Instead of bandits, she faced the perils of space pirates and unpredictable wormholes.  Dwindling supplies were replaced by the constant threat of system failure, and the fear of failure was replaced by the weight of the galaxy's future resting on her shoulders.  But like Elara before her, Nova pressed onward, driven by a desperate hope against the overwhelming odds.
