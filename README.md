
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets lost to time.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the sky, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge, fueled his weary bones and spurred him onward, a tiny speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily dance with death, but the possibility of saving her people outweighed the risks.  The vast, breathtaking expanse of space, shimmering with a million distant suns, offered both incredible beauty and terrifying unknowns, pushing Elara and her crew to the limits of their courage and their technology.
