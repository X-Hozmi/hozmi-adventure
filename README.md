
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a whisper on the wind, a legend fueled by whispers of unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers – and the glorious possibilities – that lay hidden across the unforgiving landscape. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences in the face of such a grand quest.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy rumored to exist on a newly discovered planet within the nebula.  Hyperspace jumps were routine, but the unpredictable gravitational fields and pirate raids in this uncharted territory kept the adrenaline pumping.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, paled in comparison to the potential rewards, and the thrill of discovery fueled her every decision.
