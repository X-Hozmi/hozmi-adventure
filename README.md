
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of Francia was far from the romantic tales of chivalry she'd heard as a child. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through her.  She clutched the worn leather-bound map, its edges frayed from countless days spent traversing unforgiving terrain, her only guide to the rumored monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Sparks" Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring drone against the vast, inky blackness of space.  Navigation charts flickered across the console, pinpointing the course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies. While far removed from the dangers of medieval bandits, the dangers of deep space – from rogue planets to hostile alien encounters – presented a unique set of challenges, proving the thrill of exploration remained constant across millennia.
