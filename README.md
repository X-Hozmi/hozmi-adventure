
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a victory against the biting wind that whipped across the desolate plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a daunting yet alluring challenge.  My meager pack held only essentials – dried meat, a waterskin, and the map, its edges frayed from countless journeys.  This wasn't a quest for gold or glory, but a desperate search for my kidnapped sister, a journey fueled by sibling love and the unwavering hope that somewhere beyond those unforgiving mountains, she still lived.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside my viewport were breathtaking, a canvas of cosmic dust and dying stars. This wasn't a simple cargo run; I was delivering a vital shipment of terraforming agents to a newly discovered planet, Kepler-186f, a world brimming with potential, but desperately needing help to become a habitable home for humanity's expanding reach. The risks were immense – pirate attacks, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of the unknown. But the chance to shape the future, to build a new world from scratch, propelled me onward.
