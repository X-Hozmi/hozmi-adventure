
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched a tarnished map, its edges frayed from countless journeys across the treacherous terrain of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing threat of hunger and disease.  Yet, the hope of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the distance, spurred him onwards.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her cockpit.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a feat never before accomplished.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling unpredictable gravitational anomalies were all in a day’s work. The vast, uncharted expanse of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, driven by a thirst for discovery and the promise of untold riches, pressed on, a solitary explorer charting a course through the cosmos.
