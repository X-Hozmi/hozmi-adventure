The rough track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous; towering peaks scraped the sky, while deep ravines threatened to swallow man and beast whole.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the far-off monastery of St. Jude, had taken him through bandit-infested forests, across raging rivers, and over mountain passes that tested even the hardiest soul.
