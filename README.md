
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered retinue crested the pass, the wind whipping at their cloaks.  Before them lay the vast, unknown expanse of the Steppe, a tapestry of emerald grasslands punctuated by the jagged silhouettes of distant mountains. Their quest, a perilous journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, promised untold riches and glory, but also the very real threat of bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a grim reminder of the journey's daunting length.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Elara's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of interstellar space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable worlds for humanity's expansion.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering strange alien lifeforms, and battling the relentless wear and tear of faster-than-light travel, Elara and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space, driven by a thirst for discovery that mirrored their medieval predecessors, yet propelled by technology beyond their wildest imaginings.
