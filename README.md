
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's retinue as they traversed the unforgiving landscape, their horses' hooves pounding a rhythm against the parched earth.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their arduous journey.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, and every sunset tested the limits of their endurance, forging a bond stronger than steel between the weary travelers.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a feat deemed impossible by many.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel, Eva relied on cutting-edge technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, held both incredible promise and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the immense risks and staggering rewards of interstellar exploration.
