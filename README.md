
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, desperate foraging for food, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, yet the vastness of the journey tested their courage and loyalty to the breaking point.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the inky blackness towards Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was measured not in days, but in months of hypersleep punctuated by the rhythmic hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Though lacking the visceral hardships of land travel, the isolation and the weight of responsibility for her crew pressed upon Eva as heavily as any medieval burden.  The promise of a new world, a fresh start for humanity, fueled her onward.
