
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and the gnawing hunger in their bellies.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a fresh test of their endurance and loyalty, but the allure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast, unforgiving landscape, propelled them ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star lightyears from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel, Eva battled cosmic radiation and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel. The vast expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable danger, but the knowledge that lives depended on her successful delivery fueled her journey across the galaxy.
