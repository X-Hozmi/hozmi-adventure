
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby forest, sent a shiver down his spine, a reminder of the bandits, wild beasts, and treacherous terrain that lay between him and his destiny.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the mists of his imagination, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of unknown space anomalies kept her on edge.  The vast, indifferent expanse of the galaxy held both wonder and terror, a constant test of skill and courage for any interstellar traveler.
