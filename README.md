
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a king's pardon – a lifeline for her brother, accused of treason.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her journey, a perilous thread across a tapestry of warring kingdoms and treacherous landscapes, was a gamble for survival, a desperate bid against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: retrieve a vital bio-sample from a newly discovered planet on the fringes of known space.  The journey was fraught with danger – rogue asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of untold scientific advancements, and the thrill of charting the uncharted, fueled her relentless pursuit across the vast, glittering expanse of the galaxy.
