
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for a desperate pilgrimage to a rumored healing spring far across the kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the wild lands were ever present.  She pressed on, driven by faith and the unwavering strength forged in the crucible of necessity.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Starseeker*.  Their journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already spanned decades, a quest for the mythical Xylos planet, whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships tested the crew's resolve and the ship's resilience. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, offered no easy passage, yet the lure of Xylos, and the promise it held, fueled their relentless voyage across the inky black.
