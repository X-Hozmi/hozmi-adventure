
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving river of  oxen, creaking wagons, and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our relentless westward push.  Each day brings the thrill of the unknown – a whispered rumor of bandit activity, the startling beauty of an unexpected oasis, the chilling shadow of a crumbling castle glimpsed on a distant hill.  Survival depends on our collective strength, our wits, and a healthy dose of luck against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Conversely, in the 27th century,  Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Instead of bandits, she faces unpredictable gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroid fields.  Instead of oases, she discovers breathtaking alien planets – vibrant jungles teeming with bioluminescent life or desolate ice worlds harboring strange, subterranean civilizations.  Her journey, though technologically advanced, remains an adventure, a push into the unexplored expanse of the galaxy, fueled by curiosity and a thirst for discovery that mirrors the intrepid spirit of medieval explorers.
