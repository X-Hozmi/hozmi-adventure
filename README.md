
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was proving longer and more treacherous than any map foretold.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the whispers of plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast distances yet to cover, a test of both his physical endurance and his unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years of interstellar space.  Navigation relied not on crumbling maps, but on complex astrogation arrays, and the dangers weren't bandits, but rogue asteroids and the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes.  Unlike Kaelan's journey measured in months, hers spanned years, a voyage demanding not just physical strength, but the mental fortitude to endure the crushing loneliness of deep space, and the courage to face the unknown wonders and terrifying dangers beyond human comprehension.
