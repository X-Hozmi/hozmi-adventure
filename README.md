
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed close behind. Each sunrise brought the challenge of finding water and sustenance, each sunset the gnawing fear of encountering something far worse than hunger. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, the camaraderie shared around dwindling fires, and the unwavering faith in their hearts fueled their arduous trek across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research outpost on the far side of the galaxy.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate attacks. The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the boundless potential of exploration.  The galaxy held wonders beyond imagination, and Eva, charting a course through the uncharted cosmic sea, was ready to find them.
