
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold, and the hope it represented, spurred him across the unforgiving landscape, a lone knight on a desperate pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital xenobotanical samples from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with life both wondrous and deadly.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the dangers were no less real – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Eva, however, was undeterred, her courage a beacon guiding her ship across the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
