
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones amongst desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets pushed him further into the unforgiving expanse of the Sahara. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily occurrence.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, but also the cold, hard reality of potential failure.  The fate of a lost civilization rested on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any earthly burden.
