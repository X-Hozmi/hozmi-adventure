
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat and a chipped map, a testament to the months spent journeying from the bustling markets of Constantinople to the rumored sanctuary of Avignon. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the chilling whispers of the Black Death followed her every step, a constant reminder of the dangers that lay scattered across the medieval world, testing her resilience and courage with each passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the perils of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, was a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable thirst for exploration. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of new discoveries and untold riches, but also the ever-present danger of encountering unknown and hostile alien civilizations.
