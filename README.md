The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering pines of the Darkwood, a region whispered to be haunted by malevolent sprites and worse.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh shiver down his spine, but the lure of the legendary Sunstone, said to be hidden within the forgotten ruins of Eldoria, spurred him onwards.

The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant stars, was both breathtaking and terrifying.
