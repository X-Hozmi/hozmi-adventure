
The year is 1348.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a harrowing odyssey. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested their resolve. Yet, the shimmering spires of the cathedral, visible now on the horizon, spurred them on, a beacon of hope amidst the unforgiving landscape of medieval England.  Each day brought a new challenge, a new story to be etched onto the tapestry of their adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, uncharted alien systems tested the ship's systems and her own courage to the limit.  The vast expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas of unimaginable beauty, yet held perils far beyond the medieval knight's wildest dreams. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human exploration towards the distant promise of new worlds.
