
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harsher realities of famine and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of forgotten riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the clutches of space pirates, and battling the relentless wear and tear on her aging vessel were all part of the routine.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the promise of discovering new worlds fuelled her relentless pursuit of the unknown, a modern-day explorer pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
