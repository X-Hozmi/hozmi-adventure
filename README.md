
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a rumored lost city, whispered to hold knowledge beyond the Church's grasp.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown propelled her forward, each sunrise a promise of discovery, each sunset a reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  The whispers of the city, a shimmering mirage in the distance, fueled her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potentially hostile, yet scientifically invaluable, lifeforms.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, was both inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with the risk of temporal anomalies, and alien predators lurked in the shadowed corners of the galaxy. Yet, the pursuit of knowledge, the thrill of charting the uncharted, was a siren's call she couldn't resist.
