
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it held the hope of reaching the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Serpent's Pass. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for both peril and wonder – bandit raids, treacherous terrain, or the chance encounter with a mystical hermit, all part of the unpredictable tapestry of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Vast, swirling colours painted the viewport as they jumped between star systems, their destination: the Kepler-186f colony, a world promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs.  The journey, though safer than Elara's, held its own anxieties – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel, a constant companion across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
