
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged through the muddied track, the relentless rain mirroring the relentless gnawing hunger in our bellies.  Each step was a battle against the elements and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Our quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to be a paradise lost, fueled our determination, yet the reality was a constant struggle against the harshness of the medieval world – a harsh landscape mirrored only by the even harsher realities of human nature.


Millennia later, the stars are our guide, not muddied tracks.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we jump between galaxies, a cosmic leap of faith across the void.  The shimmering nebulae outside are breathtaking, but the real adventure lies in the unknown planets we explore, each a unique challenge: negotiating with sentient fungi on Xylos, evading the deadly sandstorms of Kepler-16b, or deciphering the ancient ruins of a long-dead civilization on Proxima Centauri b.  The galaxy is a vast, wondrous library, and our ship, the Althea, is our key to unlocking its secrets.
