
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a mission of vital importance that necessitated a perilous journey to Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara pressed onward, spurred by a blend of duty and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, her heart pounding in time with the rhythmic clop of her mule's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms were mere inconveniences compared to the weight of his mission: to establish contact and secure vital resources for a dying Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace brought them closer to their goal, and closer to the edge of the known universe.
