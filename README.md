
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s entourage as they trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses’ hooves echoing a lonely rhythm against the vastness.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of bandit raids and treacherous terrain, but also the thrilling promise of undiscovered lands.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging Kaelan's homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril, a constant battle against nature and nefarious men, but the lure of the unknown, the possibility of glory and salvation, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take years, potentially decades.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Alien encounters, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were but a few of the challenges facing Eva and her crew.  Yet, the allure of exploring the uncharted cosmos, of unraveling the mysteries of the universe, fueled their unwavering determination.
