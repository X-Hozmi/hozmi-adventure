
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the secret to healing a plague that ravaged her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the chilling whispers of the encroaching sickness itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against both time and the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the ancient Zydonian ruins on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable flora and long-dormant alien technology.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but also untold dangers – pirate fleets, cosmic storms, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile lifeforms.  The journey to Kepler-186f, though measured in light-years, felt like an eternity, each warp jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
