
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The shimmering heat haze of the midday sun distorted the already unfamiliar landscape of the Rhineland.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King across the treacherous, bandit-ridden mountains, felt less like a noble mission and more a desperate gamble with death. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the dense forests, heightened the sense of lurking danger; the whispered legends of monstrous beasts and vengeful spirits added to the growing dread.  His only companions were his battered sword and a dwindling supply of hardtack.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was commonplace for the seasoned spacefarer. But the eerie silence of the abandoned colony, the unsettling feeling of being watched, proved far more disturbing than any spacefaring threat. The vastness of space, once a source of wonder, now pressed in on her, amplifying the isolation and the growing sense of unease in her heart.
