
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, precious seed – a new strain of wheat rumored to thrive in the parched earth.  Bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her perilous journey from Constantinople to the distant lands of the Abbasid Caliphate, a pilgrimage driven by faith in a better harvest and the hope of a bountiful future for her people. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset the bittersweet solace of a fire under a star-studded sky.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming algae to Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet on the brink of colonization.  Warp jumps are unpredictable, the cosmos a vast and unforgiving ocean of space and time.  Pirate raids, malfunctioning hyperdrives, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation are hazards far removed from the medieval hardships, yet just as deadly. The weight of galactic responsibility rests on his shoulders as he navigates the treacherous currents of the interstellar highway, driven by a hope as boundless as the galaxy itself.
