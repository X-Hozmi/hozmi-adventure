
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the oppressive summer sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a swirling ochre cloud trailing their small company across the sun-baked plains.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliff faces, and the ever-present threat of starvation or sickness.  But the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred them onwards through the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling cosmic dust and distant suns, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional crackle of static on the comms.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant dance with danger, but Eva and her crew, a diverse band of explorers, were driven by the hope of discovering new life, new worlds, and forging humanity's path among the stars.
