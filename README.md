
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel holding all her worldly possessions.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Her journey to the fabled city of Alexandria, a quest for a rare healing herb, was fraught with peril, yet the thrill of the unknown, the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape, and the unwavering hope in her heart pushed her onward.  She was a tiny speck against the immensity of the world, yet she possessed the strength of a lioness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable space storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  His crew, a motley assortment of seasoned veterans and wide-eyed novices, relied on his experience and unwavering determination to reach their goal – a future where the galaxy was no longer a distant dream, but a navigable playground.
