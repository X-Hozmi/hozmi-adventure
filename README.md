Yet, with each passing mile, their bond as companions grew stronger, fueled by shared purpose and the thrill of the unknown.

Captain Anya adjusted her bio-suit, the oxygen mask sealing snugly against her face.  The starship, a marvel of intergalactic engineering, hummed with energy as it prepared to jump to the next galaxy.
