
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered tales of the fabled city, its riches and its mysteries, fuelled his weary steps, each sunrise a promise of another day closer to his adventure's heart.  The rough road stretched before him, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was a daily challenge, but the thrill of charting unmapped territories, of discovering new worlds and civilizations, far outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space stretched before her, a canvas painted with wonders and dangers in equal measure.
