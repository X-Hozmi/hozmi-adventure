
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to hold the key to ending a devastating plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked the land, testing his courage and resilience with every league.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its multi-hued gases a breathtaking spectacle compared to the dangers lurking within.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Sol system.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems in the inky black were all in a day's work. The vastness of space presented challenges far beyond the limitations of medieval travel, yet the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned just as brightly within her as it did in Sir Kaelan.
