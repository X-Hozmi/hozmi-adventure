
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril: treacherous mountain passes, unpredictable rivers, and the ever-present threat of war. Yet, with every hardship overcome, a fierce independence bloomed within her, fueled by hope and the unwavering love for her kin.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The journey was a tapestry of breathtaking cosmic wonders and terrifying encounters with unknown celestial phenomena.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own unique dangers, from gravitational shears to rogue asteroids, but the lure of discovery and the possibility of a new beginning far outweighed the risks.
