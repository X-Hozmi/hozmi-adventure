
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the muddy track a ribbon snaking through the endless, rolling hills of France.  Each creak of saddle leather and groan of wagon wheel was a testament to the arduous journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a holy quest fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the villages, and the sheer vastness of the unknown land threatened to swallow them whole.  Their only solace lay in the shared camaraderie and the unwavering faith that spurred them onward.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova, her weathered face etched with the map of a thousand nebulae, gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her ship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years away, was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  The risks were monumental – unforeseen gravitational anomalies, hostile alien life, or the simple mechanical failure that could condemn them to the cold emptiness of space. Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds, burned brighter than any sun.
