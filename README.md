The rutted track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering peaks kissed by snow, shadowed valleys whispering with unseen dangers.  Each day brought the thrill of discovery: a hidden monastery clinging to a cliff face, a bustling market town teeming with exotic goods and rumors of war, a perilous river crossing guarded by bandits eager for a fight.
