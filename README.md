
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of Constantinople, shimmering like a jewel on the horizon, fuels our weary steps.  The whispered tales of its exotic markets and opulent palaces, along with the promise of untold riches, outweigh the hardships, transforming every mile into a step closer to destiny.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts a swathe through the nebula, its hyperdrive humming a song of unimaginable speed.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the constellations of a thousand galaxies, her crew a diverse team of xenobotanists, astrophysicists, and hardened spacers.  The mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with swirling nebulas and blazing stars, is both terrifying and breathtaking, a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities – and perilous unknowns – that lie beyond the reach of even the most advanced technology.
