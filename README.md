
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map, promising a hidden monastery rumored to house ancient scrolls.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, sharpened her senses, the thrill of the unknown a constant companion to the gnawing hunger in her belly. Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were all potential foes on her arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of a spiral galaxy.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been flawless, but the challenges were far from over.  Resource scarcity, hostile alien lifeforms, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel all presented obstacles as formidable as any medieval mountain pass.  Yet, the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a new beginning for humanity, fueled her unwavering determination, a courage as bold as any medieval knight's.
