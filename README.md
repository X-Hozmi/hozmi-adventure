
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim realization of how far the journey still stretched across the unforgiving landscape of the known world. The lure of legend, however, burned brighter than any hardship.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of wormholes were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held dangers as infinite as its expanse, but the promise of success fueled her determination to press on, a modern-day explorer charting the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
