
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in his perilous pursuit of legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the burgeoning colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the relentless gaze of distant suns was all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the immense distances and unpredictable dangers inherent in interstellar travel, a far cry from the medieval traveler's earthly concerns.
