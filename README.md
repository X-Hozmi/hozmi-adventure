
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the dust-choked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, spurred him onward, the shimmering mirage of Zerzura a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course charted for the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was a tapestry of breathtaking nebulae and perilous asteroid fields.  Alien encounters, both hostile and benevolent, punctuated their voyage, testing the crew's resourcefulness and courage.  The potential discovery of a new habitable planet, a promise of a better future for humanity, fuelled their relentless pursuit across the infinite expanse of space.
