
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable terrain all threatened to thwart her journey, yet the unwavering hope in her heart spurred her onward.

Millennia later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues of swirling gases painted the viewport as she plotted a course to Kepler-186f, a potential human colony struggling against a hostile environment.  This wasn't a simple delivery run; pirates lurked in the black between stars, and unknown anomalies whispered of danger in the void.  But Ryla, a seasoned veteran of the galactic frontier, knew the thrill of the unknown outweighed the risk, for the survival of a fledgling civilization rested on her shoulders.
