
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – precious seeds for a famine-stricken village.  Each creak of the saddle, each sharp cry of a hawk overhead, is a thrill, a reminder of the risks she takes for her people.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey, but the unwavering hope in her heart fuels her onward, a single flickering flame against the vast, dark wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rex strides the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vast nebula of Andromeda sprawling before him.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, a gamble with potentially unimaginable rewards—or catastrophic failure.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is a constant thrum beneath his boots, a reminder of the colossal power at their command,  and the fragility of life light years from home.  While pirates and hostile alien factions pose threats,  the true adventure lies in the uncharted cosmos, a breathtaking canvas of stars and swirling galaxies waiting to be explored.
