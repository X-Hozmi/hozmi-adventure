
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of illness. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends, spurred her on, a knight errant in pursuit of a dream etched in ancient maps and whispered tales.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Navigating by the faintest glimmers of distant quasars, he relied on instinct and cutting-edge technology – a far cry from Elara's compass and star-guided map, but the spirit of adventure, the thirst for the unknown, remained the same, a constant in the human heart across the vast gulf of time.
