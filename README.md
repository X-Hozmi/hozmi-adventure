
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains a fiery orange.  Her journey across the breadth of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new river to ford.  But the lure of the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold unimaginable power, propelled her onward, fueled by hope and the grit born of necessity.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, she relied on ancient charts and cutting-edge technology to avoid the gravitational pull of rogue planets and the unpredictable bursts of cosmic radiation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and potentially life-altering discoveries.  The vastness of space held a different kind of peril than the medieval world, a solitude both terrifying and exhilarating.
