
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested her strength and resilience, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a fresh wave of determination fueled her onward, the promise of the holy city a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.  Each hardship was a story etched into her soul, adding depth and richness to the tapestry of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through unmapped galaxies, a perilous undertaking even for the most seasoned explorer.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the gravity wells of rogue planets, and battling temporal anomalies were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held countless wonders and dangers, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown. The cosmos, her canvas, awaited her brushstrokes of discovery.
