
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like the teeth of some slumbering beast.  Her worn map, more tattered than a beggar's cloak, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each hesitant step of her mount, was a gamble against the unknown – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The rumored city of Eldoria, with its fabled golden spire, beckoned, a siren's call promising riches and glory, but the path was fraught with peril at every turn.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents and dodging rogue asteroids was child's play compared to the unknown horrors that might lurk within the anomaly itself.  The vast emptiness of space, despite the shimmering beauty, held a chilling silence that whispered of countless perils, yet the lure of discovery, the promise of finding those long-lost souls, fueled her unwavering resolve.
