
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her meager pack.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits had lurked in shadowed forests, rivers had swelled into raging torrents, and the relentless sun had tested her endurance.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and secrets, pushed her onward, each hardship a stepping stone to a legendary destination.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was a constant companion, the glittering tapestry of stars both awe-inspiring and isolating.  Hyper-jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of space pirates added a layer of tension to her already demanding voyage.  But Lyra, a veteran of countless interstellar journeys, pressed on, her resolve as strong as the ship beneath her command.
