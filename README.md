
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the biting wind, but the thrill of her journey overshadowed the discomfort.  Ahead lay Avignon, a city shimmering with rumored riches and even more dangerous intrigue.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of a plague followed her like a phantom, but the promise of adventure – of discovering unknown lands and forging her own destiny – spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla adjusted the chronometer on her wrist, the swirling nebula of Xylos burning bright through the viewport of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril from unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, stretched before her, beckoning her towards the unknown with a siren's call only a true adventurer could resist.
