
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the King's ailing son.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the hope of a successful return, and the chilling fear of failure.  The vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe was their battlefield and their only guide.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation were daily challenges. But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of groundbreaking scientific discovery, and the unwavering camaraderie of her crew pushed her relentlessly forward, across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
