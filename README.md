
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden in the heart of the Sahara.  Bandits, scorching sun, and the gnawing fear of the unknown were constant companions, but the lure of the mythical oasis, a place of unimaginable riches and power, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise offered a new challenge, each sunset a desperate hope for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of distant planets painting the viewport.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies, Eva and her crew faced a galactic odyssey of unimaginable scale. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, also held a chilling emptiness, a stark reminder of their isolation and the unknown perils that awaited them in the black abyss.
