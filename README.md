
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both wonder and peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving lands.  She carried only her wits, her faith, and a worn map promising untold riches, or perhaps, only death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck amidst cosmic giants.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own dangers – unpredictable spatial anomalies, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space.  But the hope of reuniting with her people fueled her journey, a voyage far removed from the medieval treks of her ancestors, yet echoing the same spirit of daring adventure and unwavering resolve.
