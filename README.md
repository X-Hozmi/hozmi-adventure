
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  The whispers of Saracen raiders and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees mountains did little to deter her; she was on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a journey fraught with peril but rich with the promise of spiritual enlightenment and untold stories gathered along the way.  Each rickety bridge crossed, each village encountered, brought new faces, new challenges, and new fragments of a life lived boldly on the edge of civilization.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the unexplored Kepler-186f system.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the sense of exploration remained the same – a thirst for the unknown, a willingness to face the vast emptiness between worlds, and the hope of discovering something extraordinary amongst the stars.  The risks were cosmic, the rewards potentially limitless.
