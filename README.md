
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying serpent of pack animals and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress towards the mythical city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present discomfort of relentless heat. Yet, the lure of the Silk Road, the whispered promises of untold riches and exotic wonders, pushes us onward, a testament to the human spirit's relentless thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant, comforting thrum against the vast, inky blackness of interstellar space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is measured not in days, but in generations, yet the crew, descendants of pioneers, hold steadfast to their mission.  Their courage isn't forged in the face of bandits or starvation, but the unimaginable distances and the constant risk of system failures, all for the chance to discover a new home amidst the breathtaking, terrifying majesty of the cosmos.
