
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just meager rations; it contains the King's decree, a risky mission to forge an alliance with a distant, untrustworthy lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispers of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The journey is arduous, but the potential rewards – peace for her kingdom – fuel her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of unimaginable colours. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes is routine, but the unknown dangers of a new world – alien life, hostile environments – are a constant, thrilling pressure.  The vast emptiness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a stark contrast to the close, claustrophobic confines of her ship, where the hum of the engines is the only constant companion on this epic interstellar voyage.
