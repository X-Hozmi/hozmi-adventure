
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts, and into the shadow of ancient, whispering forests. Each day brought fresh peril – bandit ambushes, river crossings swollen with spring melt, and the constant threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of the shrine, the whispers of miracles and the unwavering faith of Sir Kaelan fueled their onward push, each sunrise a testament to their resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, flung across a gulf of unimaginable distance.  Warp drives hummed, navigating the treacherous currents of spacetime, while automated systems monitored the ship's integrity against micrometeoroid impacts and the unpredictable gravitational forces of distant stars.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced not only the vastness of space but also the psychological toll of isolation and the ever-present threat of unforeseen technological malfunctions. The promise of a new home, however, and the mysteries of New Eden, kept them focused on their perilous, galaxy-spanning voyage.
