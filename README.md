
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and hurried scribbles, offered little comfort against the howling wind.  The whispered legends of the lost city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis hidden amongst the unforgiving dunes, fueled her onward, despite the gnawing fear of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness. Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath of her mount, was a testament to the perilous journey ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous currents of spacetime, Ryla expertly dodged asteroid fields and navigated gravitational anomalies, her keen eyes glued to the swirling nebulae visible on the ship's main viewscreen.  The mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – alien predators, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile civilizations – but the reward, unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel, made the gamble worthwhile.
