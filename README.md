
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a rumored lost monastery, said to hold ancient healing secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.  The whispered tales of the monastery fuel her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain expanse of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a legendary lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the chasm between dimensions.  Warp drives hum, alien landscapes flash past her viewport, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurks in the shadows of unexplored space. Each hyperspace jump is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos and the unknown dangers that wait beyond the edge of known space. The promise of the lost colony, however, guides her through the inky black, a celestial siren's call in the vast expanse of the universe.
