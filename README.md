Dust billowed behind them, a testament to their weeks traversing the unforgiving landscape.  They journeyed to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, testing their courage and resolve with every league conquered. The whisper of adventure fueled their weary bodies, a beacon guiding them through the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling cosmic storms, and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were all part of a typical week for the intrepid captain. The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held the promise of discovery and the thrill of the unknown, making each interstellar journey a perilous but exhilarating adventure.
