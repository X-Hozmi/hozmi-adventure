
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, each sunset the gnawing fear of dwindling supplies.  The promised silks of the East feel impossibly distant as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, the whispers of plague and war ever-present in the dust-choked air.  The reward is a mythical city, a whispered legend – but the journey itself, fraught with peril and unexpected camaraderie, is already a lifetime's worth of stories.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar exploration, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising life beyond our dying sun.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in generations, yet the thrill of discovery – the possibility of encountering alien civilizations, charting new worlds, and unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos – fuels our tireless pursuit. The risk of encountering unknown dangers in the vast expanse of space is ever-present, a constant reminder of the courage it takes to venture into the great unknown.
