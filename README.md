
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy lanes of London, a knapsack slung over my shoulder overflowing with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clings to my clothes as I join a caravan heading east, towards the fabled Silk Road.  Each sunrise brings a new vista – rolling hills giving way to towering mountains, bustling market towns replaced by silent forests guarded by watchful wolves.  Every day is a gamble against bandits, disease, and the sheer unforgiving nature of the land, yet the lure of the unknown, the promise of exotic spices and faraway lands, pushes me onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is my constant companion.  Stars streak past the viewport as we jump between galaxies, charting a course through the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda Galaxy.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a settlement swallowed by the cosmic expanse generations ago.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and uncharted wormholes, pales in comparison to the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of finding not just a lost colony, but a whole new understanding of our place within the universe.
