
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of a distant city shimmering in the heat haze.  Her journey across the fractured kingdom has been perilous – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and nights spent shivering under a star-strewn sky.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager sustenance in hostile villages.  Yet, the whispered legends of the mythical Sunstone, hidden within the city walls, fuel her relentless pursuit, driving her ever onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll raiders, she relies on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to traverse the vast emptiness between worlds.  The galaxy stretches before them, a tapestry of untold wonders and unimaginable dangers, the fate of a lost colony hanging in the balance.
