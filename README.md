
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, the last seed of a rare drought-resistant grain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, but the thought of her people spurred her onward, past bandits and treacherous passes, towards the legendary monastery rumored to hold the key to their survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a revolutionary energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the relentless gravitational pull of Xylos's twin suns was child's play compared to the political intrigue and intergalactic pirates that threatened to derail his mission.  The vast, unknown expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a constant reminder of the high stakes of his interstellar journey.
