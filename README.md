
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each winding path held the promise of peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace. The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, presented challenges far beyond anything faced by land-based travelers of old, but the promise of discovery and the bond of her crew kept the *Stardust Drifter* hurtling towards the unknown.
