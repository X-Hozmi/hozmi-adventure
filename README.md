
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each step was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable mountain paths threatened to send her and her beast tumbling into oblivion.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, her heart a drum against the harsh landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, had been treacherous, the hyperspace currents unpredictable and violent.  Ahead lay the challenge of landing on an alien world, facing unknown flora, fauna, and perhaps, other sentient beings.  But the promise of a new beginning, a new home for humanity, fueled her determination, a beacon brighter than any star.
