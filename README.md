
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence a fiery orange.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Papal court, was far from luxurious.  Days bled into weeks filled with the gruff camaraderie of fellow travelers, the sting of relentless sun, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of anticipation and trepidation, a potent cocktail fueling her onward, one step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx “Razor” Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, was both exhilarating and terrifying.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the occasional crackle of static from the comms, and the ever-present danger of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational pulls kept his crew alert.  Their quest for a new home was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a journey far grander than any medieval pilgrimage.
