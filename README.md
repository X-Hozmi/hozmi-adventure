
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical city of Ys.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of Ys, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were commonplace hazards.  The crew, a motley band of explorers and scientists, faced the unknown with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the potential for unimaginable discovery – and equally unimaginable peril.
