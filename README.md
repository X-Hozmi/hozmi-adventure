
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies and a heart full of hope for Constantinople.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient oaks, and the biting wind threatened frostbite, but the whispers of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential adventure, a test of her courage and resilience in a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy, leaving a shimmering trail in its wake.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory warships of the Kryll Hegemony were just part of the thrill.  Lyra, a veteran explorer with a thirst for the unknown, faced the vast emptiness of space with a steely gaze, her spirit undaunted by the immense distances and the myriad dangers that lay between her and her goal.
