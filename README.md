
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the treacherous Baron Alaric, a journey fraught with peril – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Each sunrise brings new challenges, testing his courage, his loyalty, and the very limits of his endurance.  The whispers of ancient prophecies, and the hope of reclaiming his family's honor, fuel his onward stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, flung across the Andromeda galaxy generations ago.  Navigation is a perilous dance with unpredictable gravitational forces and uncharted wormholes, each jump a gamble with fate.  Alien landscapes, teeming with bizarre flora and fauna, beckon from distant moons, but the crew must remain vigilant against the lurking dangers of space – derelict starships, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  The hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the mystery of New Eden's disappearance, propels her across the vast emptiness of space.
