
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of creaking wagons and weary beasts, cuts a slow path across the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, the promise of bustling market towns, and the ever-present whisper of the untamed wilderness stretching towards the Pyrenees.  The rough-hewn map, more speculation than certainty, is our only guide, each landmark a hard-won victory against the relentless challenges of the road, a testament to human resilience and the insatiable desire for adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship gleaming like a polished obsidian tear, cuts through the void between galaxies, its trajectory plotted across unimaginable distances.  We are explorers charting nebulae, mapping the gravity wells of undiscovered planets, and facing the chilling vastness of space. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a quest to unveil the secrets of the cosmos and expand the boundaries of human knowledge.
