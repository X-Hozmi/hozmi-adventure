
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, was a race against time and the relentless pursuit of bandits.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of ambush.  His only companions were his loyal sword and the unwavering resolve born from a desperate hope for his homeland's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient star charts were all part of her daily routine, a testament to human ambition pushing against the boundaries of space and time.
