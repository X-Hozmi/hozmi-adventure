
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the unforgiving elements themselves. The journey was a constant test of endurance, a gamble with fate, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a breathtaking backdrop to the immense risk.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would test the limits of their ship's hyperdrive and their own courage.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a roll of the dice. But the promise of discovering a new civilization, a new technology, or simply the thrill of exploration, fueled their daring quest across the uncharted cosmos.
