
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor consolation for the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance from a passing knight, each whispering wind through the olive groves, was a potential obstacle on her perilous journey, a test of her resilience and faith. Bandits, disease, and the sheer vastness of the land itself threatened to consume her before she reached her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the galaxy spread before her like a cosmic tapestry. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The vastness of space was less daunting than the political machinations of the Galactic Federation, ever watchful for a technological breakthrough that could upset the precarious balance of power.  Each jump through hyperspace, each risky rendezvous with alien traders, each potential ambush by space pirates, brought her closer to the edge of discovery – and peril.
