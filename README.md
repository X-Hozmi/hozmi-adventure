
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a grim reminder of the perilous journey still ahead.  The whispered tales of Eldoria fueled his spirit, but the harsh reality of the road tested his resolve with every aching muscle and dwindling supply.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable effects of hyperspace jumps were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, but the hope of finding Kepler-186f, and perhaps even a new beginning for humanity, kept her engines roaring towards the unknown.
