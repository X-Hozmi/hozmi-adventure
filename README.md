
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World, a mountain range rumored to be home to griffins and worse.  Her worn map, a patchwork of sketches and faded notations, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, but the promise of the fabled Sunstone city beyond spurred her onward.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown.

A thousand years hence, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present danger of space pirates kept even the most seasoned navigators on edge.  The thrill of discovery, the allure of alien landscapes and the potential for untold riches, fueled her journey across the vast expanse of the cosmos, a far cry from the dusty trails of her ancestors, yet echoing with the same spirit of adventure.
