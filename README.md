
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had already tested her resilience.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few obstacles she’d overcome.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura's rumored treasures and forgotten magic fueled her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned spacers, were charting a course to the unmapped galaxy of Andromeda.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of hyperspace jumps and unpredictable celestial anomalies kept every mission fraught with peril.  The allure of discovering new life forms and charting uncharted territories far outweighed the risks for Rexa, her insatiable curiosity a compass guiding her through the vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos.
