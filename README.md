
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel contained more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and salvation as she navigated treacherous roads, relying on the kindness of strangers and the strength of her own resolve to reach the rumored sanctuary across the mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising terraforming project light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic vista outside her viewport.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate factions were just part of the routine, the thrill of exploration tempered by the weight of responsibility for her crew and the future of humanity's expansion among the stars.
