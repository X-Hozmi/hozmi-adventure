
The year is 1347. The cobbled streets of London are alive with the clatter of horseshoes and the shouts of merchants. You, a young blacksmith's apprentice, yearn for adventure beyond the city walls. A whispered rumour of a lost city in the heart of the Black Forest, guarded by mythical beasts, sparks a fire in your soul. You pack your meager belongings, trade your hammer for a sword, and set out with a band of weary travelers, each with their own secrets and ambitions. The journey will be fraught with danger, from bandits lurking in the shadows to the unforgiving wilderness itself.

The starship "Odyssey" bursts from Earth's atmosphere, leaving behind the blue marble for a journey across the vast unknown. Your destination: Proxima Centauri b, a planet orbiting the closest star to our sun. You, a seasoned astro-engineer, are tasked with constructing the first human colony on this alien world. The voyage will be long, the challenges immense. You will face the dangers of the void, from rogue asteroids to rogue AI systems, each testing your skills and pushing you to the limits of your resilience. But the promise of a new world, a new frontier for humanity, fuels your drive.
