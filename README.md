
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each rocky pass, each treacherous river crossing, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the harsh elements. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled her onward, transforming the arduous journey into a desperate, thrilling quest.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and pirate raids.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on him, but the weight of his responsibility, the hope of finding his lost kin, propelled him through the cosmic unknown.
