
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless downpour.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the key to curing the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mixture of dread and desperate hope, a constant companion on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, reassuring thrum against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  While the dangers were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, the unknown alien lifeforms – the spirit of adventure burned as bright as it had in Reginald's time.  The vastness of space presented a challenge as daunting as any medieval forest, demanding courage, skill, and unwavering resolve.
