
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the whispers of the plague stalked her every step.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the unpredictable nature of the medieval world.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the promise of spiritual solace fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with dangers far exceeding anything a medieval pilgrim could imagine.  Warp-jumps threatened to tear her vessel apart, hostile alien lifeforms lurked in the unexplored reaches of space, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive pressed on her nerves. But the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding answers to humanity's ancient questions, propelled her forward, a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the vast, uncharted cosmos.
