
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he rides towards the rumored hidden city of Eldoria.  His worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offers little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty of the journey.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation in the barren plains. Yet, the lure of Eldoria's legendary riches and untold magic fuels his weary steps, promising an adventure that will etch his name into the annals of history.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships is commonplace on her journey across the galaxy, but the true peril lies in the unknown—the breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers of alien landscapes waiting to be discovered. The vast emptiness of space is both her ally and her enemy, offering both freedom and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.
