
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Yet, the whispered legends of Saragossa's hidden treasures, and the yearning for something more than her humble village life, spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  unpredictable solar flares threatened to fry her ship's systems, while the silent expanse between stars held unknown dangers.  But Eva, fueled by the boundless curiosity of humankind and the promise of discovery, pressed onward, a tiny speck of courage against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.
