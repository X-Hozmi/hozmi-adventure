
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the sun a relentless hammer on her back.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promises a legendary lost city nestled amongst the jagged peaks.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, but the allure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown fuel her onward. Each creaking step is a victory against the vast, unyielding wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, navigate treacherous nebulae and gravitational anomalies in search of a habitable planet beyond the known colonies.  The vast emptiness of space is a different kind of wilderness, teeming with its own dangers: rogue asteroids, hostile alien life, and the ever-present fear of system failure.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity's reach, outweighs the peril.
