
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but vital herbs for a plague-stricken village, a journey undertaken not for glory, but for compassion.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely inconveniences in her quest.  Each sunrise brought fresh peril, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the lurking dangers of a world untamed.  Her adventure was not of riches or power, but of courage and unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Nird, a journey fraught with the perils of stellar radiation, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of navigation errors in uncharted space.  Unlike Elara, Eva's journey was fueled by the promise of technological advancement and interstellar prosperity, but the courage, resourcefulness, and unwavering resolve remained the same, echoing across the vast gulf of time separating their adventures.
