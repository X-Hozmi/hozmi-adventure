
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth distorted the already distant spires of the rumored city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were familiar companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving desert, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the unpredictable nature of human cruelty.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura’s fabled riches and lost knowledge fueled her onward, a tiny ember of hope in the vast, desolate landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The iridescent clouds of gas swirled around her vessel, a breathtaking but dangerous spectacle.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the ever-present threat of space anomalies were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Ryla.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying perils, but the promise of discovery kept her engines roaring towards the unknown.
