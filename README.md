
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a rutted goat path, offered little comfort.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Alaric from the clutches of the Black Hand – led him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests teeming with banditry, and across sun-baked deserts where mirages mocked his parched throat. Each sunrise brought a new peril, each sunset a hard-won victory, etching the landscape and its dangers into his very soul.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos Cluster.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a marvel of intergalactic engineering, leaped across lightyears with each carefully calculated jump.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos Prime and determine the fate of its inhabitants.  The cosmic expanse held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but Elara, with her seasoned crew, faced them with steely determination, their sights set on the unknown wonders and perils that awaited them among the stars.
