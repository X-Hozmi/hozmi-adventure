
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon – was a perilous undertaking.  Bandits lurked in every shadow, and the very landscape seemed to conspire against her with its treacherous terrain and unpredictable weather.  Each day brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages, but the urgency of her mission fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey fraught with unforeseen gravitational anomalies and unpredictable wormholes.  Advanced technology lessened the physical hardships, but the isolation and the ever-present threat of cosmic storms tested her crew’s resilience. The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval world's crowded landscapes, held its own unique brand of fear and wonder.
