
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's retinue as they traversed the unforgiving terrain, their horses’ hooves sinking into the parched earth.  The sun beat down mercilessly on their armored backs, a stark contrast to the biting winds they'd endured just days prior in the northern mountains.  Their quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Aloria, was a perilous undertaking, fraught with the dangers of bandits, treacherous landscapes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each mile gained felt like a victory, a testament to their endurance and unwavering purpose.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political minefield that awaited them on the K'tharr homeworld. Their mission: to secure a rare element vital to sustaining life on their dying planet.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held its own dangers – rogue energy storms, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith towards a future that hung precariously in the balance.
