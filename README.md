
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of saving his kingdom from a devastating plague.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the tension, the unknown lurking in every shadow a constant companion on this perilous journey across uncharted lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets were just some of the hazards of interstellar travel. The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to Reginald's forested path, held its own unique terrors - silent, unseen threats that could cripple her ship in an instant.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding new life and new worlds, drove her onward, a different kind of adventure fueled by the limitless expanse of the cosmos.
