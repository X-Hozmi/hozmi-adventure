
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey across the unforgiving plains of Castilla was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers swelled with unpredictable spring rains, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at their small band.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the promise of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, fueled her unwavering determination. The map, tattered and faded, was their only guide through this treacherous landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth, but Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, was unfazed.  The vast, uncharted expanse of space held both unimaginable beauty and unimaginable danger, but the allure of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, kept her engines humming and her heart ablaze.
