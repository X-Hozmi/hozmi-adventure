
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest – to reach the mythical city of Ys and find a cure for her ailing brother – pushed her onward, the relentless sun a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  She navigated by the stars, her courage fueled by hope, the rough terrain reflecting the roughness of her determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rendar piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his ship a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional methods.  Warp drive hummed, a constant thrum beneath the floorplates as he navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets. The galaxy unfolded before him, a tapestry of vibrant nebulas, dying stars, and the promise—or peril—of the unknown.
