
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, propelled her relentlessly forward.  The adventure, fraught with peril, promised untold riches and glory, a reward worth risking everything to claim.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of his starship.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was all in a day’s work for a seasoned spacer like Rexx, but the whispers of ancient, powerful beings guarding the colony added an edge of thrilling uncertainty to his otherwise routine interstellar haul.  The galaxy was his playground, but this mission promised to be far more than just another job.
