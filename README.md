
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Each creak of the saddle, each crunch of rock underfoot, was a reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant threats, but the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, cold landscape.

Alternatively, centuries hence, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were hazards far removed from the medieval dangers Elara faced, yet equally perilous in their own right.  The vastness of space, however, offered a different kind of awe, a breathtaking spectacle that fueled her drive just as the beauty of the medieval world fueled Elara's.
