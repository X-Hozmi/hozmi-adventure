
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the unforgiving terrain tested her resilience at every turn. Each night, huddled around a meager fire under a vast, star-studded sky, she dreamt not of comfort, but of the breathtaking wonders that awaited her, if she could only survive the treacherous path.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers in the vast emptiness of space was a constant battle against the odds.  Yet, the promise of discovering a new world, a new civilization, fueled her relentless drive, pushing her and her crew to the very limits of their endurance. The universe held its breath as they ventured into the unknown.
