
The year is 1347.  Our battered wagon creaks across the rutted track, the relentless sun beating down on our small band.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we push ever eastward, towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Whispers of unimaginable riches and ancient magic fuel our journey, outweighing the ever-present dangers of bandits, disease, and the unforgiving wilderness.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording raging rivers, and bartering for scarce supplies in dusty villages – all in the desperate hope of reaching our fabled destination.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship powered by harnessed quasars, cuts through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years away.  The crew, a diverse team of explorers and scientists, face perils far removed from bandits and drought: asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unforeseen alien life.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to uncover new worlds and expand humanity's reach across the galaxy, drives them onward, through the vast and awesome emptiness between the stars.
