
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the sky, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of the unknown, the chance to etch his name into the annals of history, spurred him onward, every aching muscle a testament to his unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a colony fleeing a dying Earth.  Vast distances separated star systems, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  The crew faced dangers both tangible – hostile alien lifeforms and malfunctioning systems – and intangible – the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present weight of their people's hope resting on their fragile vessel.
