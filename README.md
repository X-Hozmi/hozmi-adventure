
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of losing our way in this unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's wonders – its shimmering oasis, its fabled lost library – propel us onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrates through Captain Eva Rostova’s bones as she navigates the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the cosmos is a treacherous mistress; nebulae shimmer like cosmic traps, rogue asteroids threaten to shatter their shields, and the whispers of the K'tharr, a sentient space-faring fungus, warn of impending doom. Yet, the potential for interstellar revolution, for unlocking the universe’s mysteries, outweighs the immense risks, driving Eva and her crew across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
