
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses’ hooves raising miniature dust devils.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Elara, had already claimed several men to fever and exhaustion.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the saint’s miraculous power, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, their resolve tested with every sunrise.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was treacherous; asteroid fields threatened to pulverize their vessel, and the unpredictable gravitational forces of nearby stars demanded constant course corrections.  The crew, a diverse team of scientists and explorers, faced not only the physical dangers of interstellar travel but also the psychological strain of prolonged isolation and the ever-present weight of their mission: to find a new home for humanity amidst the vast, unknowable cosmos.
