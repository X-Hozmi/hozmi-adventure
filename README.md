
Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track stretched before him, a ribbon of ochre winding through the unforgiving landscape.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, fueled his perilous journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandit ambushes, monstrous beasts, or the subtle magic of the fey.  Survival depended on his wits, his sword, and the unwavering loyalty of his small band of companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of distant suns was a constant challenge.  But the allure of discovering new life, new technologies, and expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos overshadowed the inherent risks. The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of untold wonders – or utter annihilation.
