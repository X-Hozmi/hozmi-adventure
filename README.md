
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's band of knights crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before them. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous terrain tested their mounts, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and camaraderie.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet clinging to life on the edge of explored space.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational fields and asteroid showers, the vastness of the cosmos both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The journey was a gamble against time and the unknown, the success of her mission resting on her skill, the ship's integrity, and a dash of luck in the face of the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
