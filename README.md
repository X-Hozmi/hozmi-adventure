
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled the air as he navigated the treacherous, overgrown track through the Black Forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought the thrill of the unknown – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present specter of disease were all part of the perilous adventure.  He pressed on, driven by hope and the unwavering spirit of a knight errant.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement cut off from the rest of humanity for generations.  The jump to hyperspace was a calculated risk, a leap of faith into the vast unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory void-beasts was child's play compared to the political machinations and potential betrayal that lurked within the crew itself.  The ultimate prize – the rediscovery of a forgotten people – was worth the staggering odds.
