
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, guided his weary horse through the shadowed Bavarian forest.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of the animal was a heartbeat in the symphony of his perilous journey.  He carried a sealed scroll, a message of vital importance to the King, a secret guarded with his life, demanding passage through bandit-infested passes and treacherous mountain trails.  The whispered tales of mythical beasts and haunted castles only added to the ever-present sense of adventure, a thrilling yet terrifying cocktail of hope and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula aboard the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vast, inky blackness punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant stars.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The allure of discovery, the potential for finding new life and new worlds, fueled her and her crew, making the inherent danger a price worth paying for the ultimate adventure.
