
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, surveyed the endless, rolling hills of France.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Orb of Aethelred from the clutches of the treacherous Baron Martel.  The journey had been fraught with peril: ambushes by bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onward, the weight of his duty a heavy yet exhilarating burden. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, new landscapes, and the ever-present possibility of glory – or a gruesome end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  The mission: to locate a lost colony ship, the 'Hope's End'.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and repairing critical systems under the threat of cosmic radiation were just some of the daily challenges.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the sheer scale of the unknown fueled her unwavering spirit.  Each jump to hyperspace brought her closer to her goal, a journey fueled by the hope of finding lost souls, and the intoxicating allure of the cosmos.
