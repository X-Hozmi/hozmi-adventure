
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, the scent of woodsmoke and roasting meat clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead lay the long road to Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the challenges I faced. Yet, the allure of the exotic East, the whispered tales of Byzantium's glittering treasures and scholarly wisdom, fueled my weary limbs and spurred me onward.  Each sunrise brought a new landscape, a new encounter, a new story etched into the tapestry of my adventure.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped to warp speed, leaving the swirling nebula of the Crab Cluster behind.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy, light years from our Sol system.  This wasn't a journey measured in months, but in generations, yet the legacy of exploration pulsed through our crew’s veins.  We carried with us not just cargo, but the hope of finding new resources, new life, and new knowledge, pushing the boundaries of human existence into the vast, unknowable cosmos.
