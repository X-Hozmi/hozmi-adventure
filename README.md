
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and the thrill of the unknown – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the disease itself shadowed his every step, yet the promise of Ys spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigation was treacherous,  requiring deft piloting amidst asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of adventure; the perils were cosmic rather than earthly, but the courage and determination needed to persevere remained the same.
