
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step brought her closer to the unknown, a tapestry woven with perilous river crossings, ambushes by brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of healing fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than the setting sun.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Xylos was fraught with danger;  unstable wormholes, pirate raids, and the constant threat of meteor showers were just a few hazards in this vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  But the promise of the Xylossian crystal, a rare element crucial for galactic peace, outweighed the risks. Ryla gripped the controls, her breath catching in her throat as the ship lurched, the cosmos a breathtaking, terrifying canvas outside her viewport.
