
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a tattered flag.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a legend whispered in hushed tones in every village she'd passed.  Her quest—to reach the fabled city of Zerzura and deliver a crucial message—depended on her navigating its perilous swamps and evading the outlaws rumored to prey upon travelers.  Each day brought new challenges: scorching sun, icy nights, and the constant threat of bandits, but the allure of the unknown fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding pirate raids were commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Yet, the promise of reuniting with lost kin and uncovering the secrets of Aethel's disappearance drove Ryla and her crew, making the vast emptiness of space a canvas for their courageous adventure.
