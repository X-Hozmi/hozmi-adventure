
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor comfort against the gnawing fear in her belly.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present shadow of the plague. Yet, the glint of the distant mountains fueled her onward, a beacon of hope in a vast and unforgiving world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with unstable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failure.  Navigating by the faintest starlight and the whispers of ancient cartography, Eva pushed the boundaries of human exploration, her courage a testament to the unyielding human spirit that sought to conquer not just lands, but the very cosmos itself.
