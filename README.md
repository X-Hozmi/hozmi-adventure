
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn map, more faded smudges than clear lines, guided her towards rumored riches hidden in a forgotten monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or even the wrath of nature itself. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends, spurred her onward, a single woman against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint whispers of quasars and the shimmering trails of nebulae, her crew charted a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The dangers here were different – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of system malfunctions.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to push humanity's boundaries beyond the known cosmos, fueled their courage in the face of the immense, breathtaking darkness of space.
