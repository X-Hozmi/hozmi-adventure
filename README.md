
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the scent of pine and damp earth battling the stench of the unwashed crowd she'd left behind in Avignon.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the secret to curing the Black Death that ravaged her village.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable elements themselves all vying for her attention on this perilous journey across the fractured lands.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring salvage operation on a derelict freighter orbiting a gas giant, a potentially lucrative but extremely risky endeavor.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but dangers remained: pirate ships lurking in the shadows of asteroid fields, unstable wormholes threatening to tear her vessel apart, and the ever-present threat of the unknown within the uncharted reaches of space.  The universe promised riches beyond imagining, but demanded a price in equal measure.
