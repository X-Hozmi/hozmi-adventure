
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a precious scroll containing a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sparks a fresh wave of apprehension, but the hope of salvation propels her onward through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Every sunset brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy is risky, a daring expedition to a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, face down gravitational anomalies, navigate asteroid fields with hair-raising precision, and grapple with the loneliness of interstellar travel.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
