
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  He’d traded his meager inheritance for a mule laden with spices and a map promising untold riches in the far east.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant battle against the elements and the unknown, but the lure of adventure, the whisper of distant lands and unimaginable wealth, kept his spirit burning.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage fraught with its own unique perils.  Instead of bandits, she faced rogue asteroids and cosmic storms.  Instead of disease, there was the ever-present threat of radiation and hostile alien lifeforms. But the vast, awe-inspiring canvas of space, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fuelled her intrepid spirit, mirroring the pioneering spirit of those medieval adventurers before her.
