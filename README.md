
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping at her worn cloak.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the desperate hope for her brother's life, spurred her onward, her resolve as strong as the ancient stones she traversed.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of reversing the encroaching solar flare threatening Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate raids were commonplace hazards.  But the true challenge lay in the vastness of space itself – the isolation, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the constant gnawing fear of encountering something beyond human comprehension.  The fate of humanity rested on her shoulders, a weight as heavy as the dark matter clinging to the far reaches of space.
