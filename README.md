
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Jude, led her through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of whispering forests.  Each day brought a new challenge – bandits, starving wolves, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the unwavering faith in her heart, and the hope of finding solace at the shrine, spurred her onward.  The vastness of the land itself felt like an opponent, testing her resilience at every turn.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colors painted across her viewport were a breathtaking contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps were treacherous, requiring precise calculations and nerves of steel to avoid collisions with asteroids or stray gravitational pulls. The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a terrifyingly indifferent expanse; a single malfunction could mean oblivion.  Eva's courage, and the hope of finding survivors, pushed her further into the unknown.
