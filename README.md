
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, guided his destrier across the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, treacherous mountain passes, and bustling, disease-ridden towns.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every mile, the allure of the holy city fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship navigated treacherous asteroid fields.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, but the journey was far from simple.  Warp drives sputtered, alien encounters were a constant threat, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on them with a crushing weight.  But for Rostova and her crew, the unknown was their domain, the risk their reward, as they pushed the boundaries of human exploration across the uncharted galaxies.
