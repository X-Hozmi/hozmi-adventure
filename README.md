
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her forward, the camaraderie of fellow travelers a balm against the hardships, the promise of the distant cathedral a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with its own unique dangers—uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortion.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the intoxicating possibility of discovery fueled his relentless pursuit, each jump to warp speed a leap into the exhilarating, terrifying, and ultimately, irresistible unknown.
