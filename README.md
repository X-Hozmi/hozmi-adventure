The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy brown curtain obscuring the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in the distance.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the treacherous Baron Alaric, a journey fraught with peril, bandits lurking in every shadowed wood, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.

But the sheer scale of the journey, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored galaxies, and the promise of a new beginning fueled her relentless pursuit of the stars.
