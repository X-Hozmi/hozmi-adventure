
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fuels his weary body and spurs him onward, across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, uncharted alien systems tests her skills and the limits of her vessel.  The vast emptiness of space is as perilous as any medieval wasteland, but the possibility of finding a new home – a new beginning – drives her ever further into the cosmic unknown.
