
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, pressed on.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each ford across the churning river, each encounter with suspicious travelers – all were hurdles in a perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows, but the hope for his sister fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat deemed impossible by many.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing critical systems under the relentless barrage of cosmic radiation were all in a day's work. The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and terror, but the promise of discovery, of pushing humanity's reach beyond the known, propelled her and her crew towards the uncharted depths.
