
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each step, urged his weary mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards left behind.  His quest – to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria – had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the allure of Eldoria, and the glory it promised, kept him pushing forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less arduous.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged hyperdrive components, and fending off space pirates were all in a day's work.  Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, charting unexplored territories amongst the stars, fueled her relentless pursuit, a modern echo of Sir Reginald's medieval adventure.
