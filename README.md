
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks.  Her journey across the ravaged countryside was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers needed fording, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the glint of the distant mountains, rumored to hold a lost city of untold riches, spurred her on, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.  Each hardship faced, each obstacle overcome, fueled her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was a daily routine, a far cry from Elara’s earthly struggles.  Yet, the allure of the unknown remained the same – a distant planet, whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel, beckoned.  The challenges were different, the scale unimaginable, but the spirit of adventure, the unwavering pursuit of the extraordinary, burned bright within the hearts of both women, separated by epochs but united by a thirst for discovery.
