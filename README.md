
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged terrain in fiery hues.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and the loyalty of her aging steed, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her quest to find her lost brother, a drive stronger than any hardship the medieval world could throw her way.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital medical supplies across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and potentially hostile alien territories. Advanced technology shielded him from the harsh realities of space, but the dangers were no less real.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, the threat of pirate raids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially dangerous lifeforms made each jump a gamble, a thrilling adventure on a cosmic scale.
