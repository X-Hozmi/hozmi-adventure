
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the mythical city of Eldoria.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a tattered map promising riches and glory.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself posed constant threats, but the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, a single woman against the vast, unforgiving expanse of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship as they jumped between star systems, the vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos a breathtaking, yet treacherous backdrop to their journey.  Alien encounters, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were just some of the dangers they faced in their quest to push the boundaries of human exploration across the galaxy.
