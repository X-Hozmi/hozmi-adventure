
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange. Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her as she pressed onward, driven by a desperate quest to reach the rumored hidden monastery holding the key to her family's salvation.  The journey was brutal, but the promise of adventure, of discovery, fueled her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge. The crew, a diverse band of explorers, felt the thrill of charting unmapped territories light years from Earth, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown. The lure of new worlds, of potentially sentient life and untold riches, outweighed the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations or suffering catastrophic equipment failure. Their quest: to find the mythical Xylos system, a legend whispered among the stars.
