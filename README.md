His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey.  He relied on whispered maps, the kindness of strangers, and the unwavering strength of his own resolve, a true testament to the spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable alien flora and fauna.

The vastness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval landscape, held its own dangers, yet the lure of discovery and the promise of a breakthrough fueled her relentless pursuit.
