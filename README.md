
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn map, a tattered testament to countless revisions, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey across the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns and the hum of his ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Ahead lay the challenge of navigating treacherous asteroid fields, facing unknown alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  The adventure, however, promised unimaginable rewards.
