
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his armour gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  But the glint of hope in Eldoria's rumored healing power spurred him on, through sun-drenched valleys and rain-lashed highlands, towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey fraught with the perils of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vast expanse of the cosmos offered breathtaking beauty – nebulae painted across the blackness like divine brushstrokes – yet held constant danger.  The weight of responsibility for her crew and the colony's survival rested heavily on her shoulders as she navigated the unimaginable distances between worlds, a lone ship in the infinite darkness.
