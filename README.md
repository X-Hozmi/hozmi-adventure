
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering mass of mules and men, inches across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of disease.  But with every creak of the wagon wheels, every shared sip of brackish water, the thrill of the unknown burns brighter.  We seek the fabled city of Samarkand, a whispered legend on the lips of every traveler, a glittering prize at the heart of a perilous journey.  The risk is immense, but the promise of discovery fuels our weary steps.

Centuries hence, the stars are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust painting the viewport with impossible colours.  We’re charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning millennia in Earth-time, a blink of an eye in the vastness of space.  The risks are different now—the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the threat of rogue asteroids, and the chilling loneliness of deep space – but the human spirit of exploration, the burning desire to uncover the mysteries of the cosmos, remains unchanged.
