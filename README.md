
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's cart as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadows, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnaws at the edges of her resolve. Yet, the glint of gold in her hand, a family heirloom promising a new life, spurs her onward, each hardship fueling her determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel has shrunk the distances between galaxies, but the cosmos still holds unforgiving dangers.  Solar flares threaten to fry the ship's systems, rogue asteroids loom large in the void, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive is a constant reminder of the delicate balance between exploration and annihilation.  The galaxy awaits, a glittering tapestry of opportunity and obliteration.
