
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his destrier onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, a ribbon of ochre winding through the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the chilling touch of death itself.  He rode on, driven by hope and a stubborn refusal to surrender.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda galaxy.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking, yet terrifying backdrop to her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's fleeing remnants.  Faster-than-light travel was taxing, both physically and mentally, but the weight of her responsibility, the lives of billions resting on her shoulders, fueled her onward.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, was also a cruel mistress, fraught with cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown entities lurking in the dark.
