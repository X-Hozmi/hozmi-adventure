
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with fields of gold and ominous, shadowed forests. Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery hidden deep within the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each whispered rumour from weary travelers, fueled her determination against the constant threat of bandits, famine, and the ever-present specter of death itself.

Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Nebulae painted the viewport in swirling hues of purple and emerald as they navigated the treacherous asteroid field guarding the Xylos system. Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source crucial to the survival of their colony.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the crackle of comms, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life formed the soundtrack to their perilous journey across the vast cosmic ocean, a journey far removed from the dusty roads of Earth's ancient past, yet equally fraught with danger and the promise of untold rewards.
