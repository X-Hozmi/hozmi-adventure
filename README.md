
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats and a chipped map, guiding her towards the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her journey, a yearning for escape and a desperate hope for a better life driving her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating by the faint glimmer of distant quasars, she plotted a course towards the Kepler-186f system, a perilous journey across uncharted galaxies.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace – the same spirit of adventure burned within her.  The vastness of space, the mysteries it held, and the promise of discovering new worlds and civilizations beckoned her forward, defying the immense risks and the lonely expanse between the stars.
