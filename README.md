
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel holds a map, faded and cracked, promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Zerzura's magic and its lost treasures, fuels her onward.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset the hope of reaching her destination before winter’s grip tightens.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull reflecting the nebulae swirling around them.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity’s expansion.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the warp drive, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms are the realities of their journey. But Ryla and her crew, driven by curiosity and a thirst for discovery, push further into the unknown, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the profound mysteries of the cosmos.
