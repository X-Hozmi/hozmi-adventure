
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary steed as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Iberia.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Seville, led her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and past villages simmering with suspicion.  Each sunrise brought the threat of attack, starvation, or disease, but the hope of reaching her destination, of saving countless lives, spurred her onward.  The creak of saddle leather and the rhythmic beat of her horse's hooves were the soundtrack to her perilous journey, a testament to the grit and determination required for medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Nebula storms threatened to tear his ship apart, while alien life forms, both beautiful and deadly, lurked in the inky blackness between stars.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Comet relied on technology, but the courage and resolve required remained the same – a testament to humanity's enduring thirst for exploration, regardless of the era.
