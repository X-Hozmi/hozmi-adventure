
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the insidious touch of the pestilence itself.  The road was a ribbon of hardship, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming spores to the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potential but lacking the necessary life-sustaining elements.  Warp jumps punctuated the endless void, each a risky gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies.  The vastness of space held a different kind of peril than the medieval landscape, but the stakes were just as high – the future of a potential new civilization rested on her shoulders.
