
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley collection of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged through the muddied track, the stench of woodsmoke and damp earth thick in the air.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with rain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, hidden deep within the rumored lost city of Eldoria, propelled us onward, fuelled by whispers of unimaginable power and untold riches, a shimmering beacon against the grim reality of the medieval world.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves were our highways.  The crimson dust of Xylos swirled around the landing struts of the 'Stardust Drifter' as Captain Eva checked the navicomputer.  Our mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane lakes of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the perils of solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, was a far cry from the muddy trails of old.  But the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovering new life, propelled us across the vast cosmic ocean, just as the lure of Eldoria had done for our medieval predecessors.
