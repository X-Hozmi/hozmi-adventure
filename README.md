
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the very roads themselves were treacherous.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: fording raging rivers, navigating confusing mountain passes, and bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages.  The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the sheer determination to reach his destination fueled his steps, each mile a victory against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigation relied on archaic star charts and gut instinct, the vastness of space a constant, humbling reminder of humanity's fragility.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, fraught with the potential for spatial distortions, and alien encounters were always a possibility – both friendly and hostile.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the hope of finding the lost colonists, and the exhilarating freedom of interstellar travel outweighed every risk.  The universe was her playground, each jump a leap into the unknown.
