
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, guided his destrier across the windswept plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier guarding the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic, spurred him onward, his heart a drum against his ribs.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-like planet, was risky, the hyperspace currents unpredictable.  But the promise of finding new habitable worlds, new life forms, and the thrill of charting the unknown far outweighed the perils.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, challenged her every skill, pushing her to the limits of human endurance.
