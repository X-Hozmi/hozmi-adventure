
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a chipped map, her only companions the ever-present crows and the gnawing fear of bandits. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in the shadows of this vast, untamed land.  Reaching Constantinople, her ultimate destination, felt less a certainty and more a distant, shimmering mirage.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the bureaucratic maze of intergalactic trade routes and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  His destination, the fabled planet of Aethelgard, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown expanse of the cosmos.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing boundaries, fueled his every decision.
