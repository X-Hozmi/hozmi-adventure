
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming under the unforgiving sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track snaked across the unforgiving landscape, a ribbon of brown cutting through fields of gold.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Elara from the clutches of the Black Hand, a band of mercenaries rumored to be operating beyond the borders of the known world.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled his journey, the promise of glory and the recovery of a sacred artifact pushing him further into the wilderness.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a sample of Xylossian energy crystals, a resource vital to sustaining life on her overcrowded home planet.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the psychological toll of interstellar travel; the crushing loneliness and the endless expanse of the cosmos constantly gnawed at her resolve. But the promise of a better future, a future fueled by the energy crystals, kept her focused on the celestial compass, her heart filled with both dread and the heady excitement of pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
