
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the chill wind biting at her exposed skin.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, guides her towards the mythical Sunstone city.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her quest, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness.  The journey is arduous, but the promise of uncovering ancient secrets fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria pilots the *Stardust Drifter* across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her ship, a marvel of advanced technology, leaps between star systems, navigating asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a pathway to immortality.  Unlike Elara's perilous land journey, Rexx's adventure unfolds amidst the breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers of the cosmos, where the vastness of space mirrors the immensity of her ambition.
