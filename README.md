
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, urged his weary mount onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth fought with the stench of decay from a nearby village ravaged by the plague, a grim reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the next crest.  His quest – to deliver a sacred relic to the monastery high in the Alps – was fraught with peril, from bandit raids in the shadowed forests to treacherous mountain passes choked with snow.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, a relentless test of endurance and courage against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential human colony, was far from simple; navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the relentless wear and tear on their hyperdrive were all in a day's work.  But the promise of a new world, a chance to build a future amongst the stars, fuelled her determination to overcome the unimaginable distances and the inherent risks of interstellar travel.
