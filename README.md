
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a chipped map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing a rumored lost city said to hold untold riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise – or threat – of adventure.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of starvation were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, straining the vessel’s already aging engines, but the potential reward – a rumored cache of Xylos crystals on the unexplored planet Xylos – outweighed the risk.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch bound by ambition and a shared thirst for the unknown, were ready to face whatever alien landscapes or hostile species awaited them on the far side of the galaxy.
