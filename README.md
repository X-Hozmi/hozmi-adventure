Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, swirling around his small band of adventurers as they traversed the unforgiving plains towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, rivers swollen with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.
