
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey ahead.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the distant sea I yearned to reach.  My pack, heavy with meager supplies and a map older than myself, felt like a lead weight on my shoulders, but the thrill of the unknown – the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria – spurred me onward through the shadowed forests and across the windswept plains.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the adventure itself.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Beyond the viewport, a swirling nebula painted the void in breathtaking colours as we jumped between galaxies. My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the secrets of ancient civilizations that predated even humankind. This was not the perilous trek of medieval times; technology cushioned the hardships. Yet, the vastness of space, the potential dangers lurking in unexplored systems, and the sheer audacity of the journey instilled the same primal thrill of adventure as the quest for Eldoria – a different era, a different scale, but the same human hunger to explore the unknown.
