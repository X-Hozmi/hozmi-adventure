
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, urged his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease – that lurked between him and his desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from her home planet.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory space krakens were just part of the routine.  The real adventure lay in the unknown, in the possibility of discovering a new civilization, or a breathtakingly beautiful alien landscape – a reward far greater than any treasure a medieval knight could ever hope to find.
