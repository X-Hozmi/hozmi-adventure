
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors whispering through the taverns – rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, hidden somewhere beyond the treacherous Black Mire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled her yearning for adventure, for the thrill of the unknown and the promise of untold riches or devastating peril – she welcomed both with equal fervor.  This journey, though fraught with hardship, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the nebula of Xylos.  The swirling cosmic dust painted vibrant hues across her viewport, a breathtaking backdrop to the perilous task ahead: a daring rescue mission across three galaxies.  Faster-than-light travel was a double-edged sword; the jump gates were unpredictable, and pirate incursions were a constant threat.  Yet, the call to aid a stranded colony outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, held the same intoxicating allure as the untamed wilderness of old, promising both unimaginable wonders and the cold, uncaring indifference of the cosmos.
