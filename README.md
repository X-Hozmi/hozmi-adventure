
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey's success.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by the desperate pleas of his people, spurred him onward, his heart a compass guiding him through the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant Kepler-186f colony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes was a daily challenge, the vast emptiness of space both terrifying and awe-inspiring.  Each jump to hyperspace brought the promise of new worlds and untold riches, but also the ever-present danger of pirates, cosmic storms, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel.
