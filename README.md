
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snaked its way across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in my own heart.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the parched grass, held the promise of bandits or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land.  We journeyed towards the fabled city of Samarkand, driven by whispers of untold riches and a desperate need to escape the encroaching shadow of death.  The vast, unforgiving landscape tested our resilience at every turn, a constant reminder of the fragility of life on this medieval pilgrimage.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside were breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of colours unimaginable on Earth.  Our mission: to chart unexplored systems, searching for habitable planets and evidence of other civilizations.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the unknown entities that lurked in the dark reaches of the cosmos – the thrill of discovery, the pushing of boundaries, remained the same, an echo of the adventurous spirit that drove medieval travelers across continents.
