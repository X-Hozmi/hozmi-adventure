
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless French countryside in fiery hues. Her journey to Avignon, to plead her brother's case before the Pope, was far from over.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies, and constantly relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart, but for Elara, it was a desperate race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow reflecting in the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy. Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, yet the dangers remained.  Uncharted wormholes threatened to rip their ship apart, hostile alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the vast loneliness of space weighed heavily on the crew.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unimaginable vastness of the cosmos.
