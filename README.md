
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King, a perilous journey undertaken to warn of the encroaching plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought the stark reality of bandits and the wilderness itself into sharp focus.  Survival was a daily battle, waged against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: retrieve a vital bio-sample from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with bizarre, and potentially hostile, lifeforms.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks kept him on edge, a far cry from the sterile environments of galactic academies. The vastness of space was breathtaking, but the journey was as much a test of courage and skill as any medieval knight's perilous quest.
