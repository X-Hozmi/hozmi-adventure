
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown.  Each creak of the saddle, each splash through a rain-swollen stream, was a step closer to adventure, a gamble against fate itself.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a sentient plant civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was routine; the true danger lay in the unpredictable space-time distortions near the nebula's heart.  But the thrill of discovery, the chance to contact a species utterly unlike humanity, far outweighed the peril.  The vast emptiness of space was a canvas upon which the grandest adventures were painted.
