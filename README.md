Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the surrounding forest, heightened the sense of peril and promise.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

Nebula storms, pirate raiders, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms were just some of the challenges she would face in her journey across the galaxy.
