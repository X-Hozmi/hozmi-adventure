
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  The air, thick with the scent of sweat and sun-baked earth, carries the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer, a stark contrast to the hushed whispers of our group, each member burdened by their own secrets and hopes.  We journey to Constantinople, a legendary city shimmering on the horizon, a promise of both riches and peril, our path fraught with the unpredictable dangers of bandits, disease, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching desert.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Starseeker' hums beneath me as we breach the warp gate, the swirling vortex of colours a breathtaking spectacle before we emerge into the unfamiliar nebula of Xylos.  Our mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a long-lost colony on the planet Xylos IV.  The galaxy stretches before us, a limitless expanse of wonder and danger, where alien landscapes and potentially hostile civilizations await, and the only certainties are the unwavering loyalty of my crew and the unwavering thirst for discovery that burns within us all.
