
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, dust clinging to our roughspun tunics, pressed onward. The midday sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth of Provence, the scent of thyme and rosemary little comfort against the gnawing hunger in our bellies.  Each creak of our laden wagon, each rustle in the scrub, held the potential for bandits, or worse – the plague, a shadow stalking our journey from the East.  Our destination, the fabled city of Constantinople, seemed as distant as the stars themselves, a shimmering hope against the harsh reality of the road.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship cutting through the inky blackness, hurtled towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Captain Eva Rostova, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebulae outside, felt the familiar thrill of exploration despite the countless voyages already under her belt.  This time, the mission was different:  a search for a rumored habitable planet, a beacon of life amidst the vast, indifferent cosmos.  The stakes were higher, the challenges more profound, but the adventurer's spirit, the insatiable curiosity that drove humanity across continents and now across galaxies, burned bright within her.
