
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and discovery.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her pilgrimage to the rumored monastery holding the lost scroll of Aethelred.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of uncovering forgotten knowledge spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unexplored Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists and star-faring engineers, faced the cosmic unknown with a mix of apprehension and exhilaration.  Warp-jumps through unstable wormholes, encounters with sentient space flora, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each leg of their expedition a gamble.  But the lure of discovering new civilizations and unlocking the secrets of the universe far outweighed the risks.
