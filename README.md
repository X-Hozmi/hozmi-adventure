
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin shielding her from the relentless heat.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest, to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas and secure a cure for her ailing brother, drove her onward, the shimmering mirage of the distant mountains a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of the cosmic dust cloud were breathtaking, yet the mission – a daring expedition to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy – demanded unwavering focus. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of black holes was a constant battle against the unforgiving expanse of space. Each jump through hyperspace held the promise of discovery, but also the chilling possibility of never returning.
