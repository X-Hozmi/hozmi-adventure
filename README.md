
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each day brings the risk of bandits, starvation, or the unpredictable wrath of nature, but the unwavering determination in her eyes burns brighter than the midday sun.  The journey is perilous, but the potential reward outweighs every hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', cuts a shimmering path through the nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the fabled Kryll crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels from the Andromeda galaxy is commonplace, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  Yet, with each jump to hyperspace, the thrilling possibility of discovery fuels her crew's unwavering spirit and propels them ever closer to their ultimate goal.
