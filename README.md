
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the gnawing hunger were less daunting than the purpose of her journey: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, heightened the sense of peril and wonder, a constant dance between hope and fear that defined life on the medieval roads.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the hyperdrive a soothing counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to a newly discovered planet, a world teeming with potential but lacking the basic elements of life.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push beyond the known, remained a powerful and enduring human drive.
