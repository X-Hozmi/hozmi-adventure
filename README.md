
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of rosemary and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than her grandfather.  Rumours of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, had drawn her from her village, promising both fortune and adventure.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk’s cry, fueled the thrilling uncertainty of her journey, a constant dance between the hope of discovery and the ever-present threat of bandits and the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow painting the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter* in ethereal hues.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the cosmos offered no easy paths.  Pirate fleets lurked in the dark reaches between galaxies, and unknown celestial anomalies threatened to swallow his ship whole.  Jax, with his seasoned crew and a cutting-edge AI, faced a different kind of medieval quest; one where the dragons were cosmic storms and the gold was knowledge, a future that depended on the successful navigation of unimaginable distances and perils.
