The midday sun beat down relentlessly on the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, the only sounds the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves and the occasional raven's croak.

The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reminder of the immense power and fragility of her vessel as she navigated the breathtaking, and occasionally terrifying, wonders of the cosmos.
