
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones – a place of unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable dangers.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, a fire burning brighter than any hearth.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, a pilgrimage across the vast, star-dusted canvas of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate factions, and managing the ship's complex systems were daily challenges, but the potential for discovery – for forging a new life among the stars – fueled her unwavering spirit.
