
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each arduous step, a thrill of exhilaration coursed through her, fueled by the whispered legends of the holy city and the breathtaking beauty of the untamed world unfolding before her.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm as steady as the ship's warp drive.  Galaxies spun like celestial waltzes outside her viewport, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and unimaginable dangers.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Aethelred, a world teeming with strange, sentient flora and guarded by ancient, technologically superior sentinels.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and thrilling, promised adventure far beyond the scope of any medieval pilgrimage.
