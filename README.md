
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He clutched a well-worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys across the unforgiving terrain.  His quest: to find the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and forgotten knowledge.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles compared to the allure of the unknown that beckoned him further into the heart of the vast, uncharted lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint but persistent, promising hope amidst the desolate emptiness of space.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present danger of rogue K'tharr warships were commonplace hazards, but the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new worlds and civilizations, fuelled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
