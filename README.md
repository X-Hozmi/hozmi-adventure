
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn leather boots as he urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth, the only respite the occasional shade of a gnarled oak.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both man and beast, and the endless expanse of the unknown stretched before him, a tapestry woven with equal parts hope and fear. Each sunrise was a gamble, each nightfall a prayer.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the Kepler-186f colony, a world light-years from Earth, threatened by a sudden and devastating solar flare.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies were mere inconveniences compared to the potential loss of life and the untold consequences of failure.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, held equal measure of danger and breathtaking beauty,  a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
