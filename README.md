
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep with each step.  Their journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's wasting sickness, was a perilous one. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim them whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in their desperate race against time.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the distant Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the true danger lay in the unknown.  Uncharted wormholes promised shortcuts but concealed unspeakable cosmic horrors.  The quest for the legendary Xylos Crystals, capable of powering interstellar travel for generations, was a gamble on a galactic scale, demanding courage, precision, and a healthy dose of luck to survive.
