
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of illness are less daunting than the rumors of the mythical Sunstone, said to be hidden within the crumbling ruins of a forgotten city. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightens the thrill, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers and breathtaking beauty of this medieval journey.  Survival depends not only on her navigational skills but also on her wit, her strength, and the kindness of strangers – or the avoidance of them.

Centuries later,  Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond the known galaxy.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant constellations and the looming threat of unknown celestial phenomena, presents a different kind of adventure.  His courage is tested not by bandits, but by cosmic storms and the enigmatic signals emanating from the fringes of explored space.  The journey is a gamble against the odds, a testament to human curiosity in the face of unimaginable distances.
