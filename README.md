
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, held the potential for banditry or worse.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King before the encroaching French army, was a race against time and the unpredictable dangers of the medieval world; a journey testing not only his physical endurance, but also his courage and cunning.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of celestial bodies was child's play compared to the political machinations and corporate espionage she faced.  The true adventure wasn't just interstellar travel, but the struggle for resources, knowledge, and the survival of humanity amongst the stars.
