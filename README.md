
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunken City of Ys, had already claimed two of their number to fever and starvation.  Each creak of their heavily laden wagons, each rustle in the tall grass, sent shivers down their spines, for the rumors of monstrous beasts and vengeful spirits guarding the city's secrets were far from mere legends. The vastness of the unknown land stretched before them, a tapestry woven with equal parts hope and despair.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The vast distances and unpredictable cosmic phenomena presented constant peril, but the potential rewards – a new home amongst the stars – fueled their courage and kept their engines roaring towards the unknown.
