Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.

Yet, the hope of finding survivors, the promise of untold scientific discovery, fueled their journey across the vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
