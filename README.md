
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried rations and a chipped map, its promises of a mythical city whispering a siren song against the biting wind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the forest itself spoke of things best left undisturbed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the ship's bridge.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was imminent, a leap of faith across light-years, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the wormholes.  The weight of countless lives rested on her shoulders, a burden far heavier than any medieval adventurer's pack.
