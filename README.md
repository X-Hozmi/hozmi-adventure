
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager sustenance in unfriendly villages.  Yet, the lure of the legendary lost city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast uncertainty of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Jackson piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous undertaking light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crippling effects of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for Jax.  The vast, uncharted reaches of the galaxy held both wonder and unimaginable danger, but the thirst for discovery, the allure of the unknown, kept his engines roaring, pushing him ever forward towards the edge of human knowledge.
