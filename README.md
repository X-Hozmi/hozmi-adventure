
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her weathered face.  Her journey across the vast, unforgiving plains of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience. Yet, the whispered legends of the mythical city of Ys, a jewel hidden beyond the mountains, spurred her onward, fueling her with the hope of untold riches and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his destination the uncharted galaxy of Andromeda.  Navigation was a treacherous dance amongst rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies, the ship's AI a constant companion battling against cosmic radiation and temporal distortions.  The promise of a new world, teeming with exotic life and unclaimed resources, was a powerful lure, offset only by the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations or encountering the unpredictable nature of the vast, unknown cosmos.
