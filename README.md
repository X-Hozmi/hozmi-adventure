
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving peaks of the Pyrenees.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack – the price of a knight errant's journey in a time when maps were imprecise and dangers lurked around every bend.  He pressed on, driven by desperate hope and the weight of his people’s suffering.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The swirling cosmic dust painted vibrant hues across her viewport, a breathtaking spectacle masking the perilous journey ahead.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a colony that held the key to a revolutionary energy source.  The vastness of the galaxy was both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  hyperdrive malfunctions, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of uncharted wormholes were constant companions.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed on, her determination fueled by the potential to shape the future of humanity.
