
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and the weight of her secret mission.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of the plague.  Yet, the lure of the legendary City of Whispers, whispered to lie beyond the Serpent Mountains, fueled her relentless journey, a beacon against the bleakness of the medieval world.  She pressed on, her heart a drum against her ribs, a lone adventurer against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint whispers of quasars and the shimmering trails of nebulae, she charted a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of cosmic wonder and terrifying unknowns, dwarfed even the medieval world's challenges.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards – unlocking interstellar travel and uniting disparate civilizations – were worth the risk.
