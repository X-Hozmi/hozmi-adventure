
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant kingdom.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, the whispered tales of bandits and mythical beasts adding to the already daunting journey.  The vast, unknown wilderness stretched before her, a tapestry of peril and possibility woven together.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted a breathtaking canvas across the viewport, a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: a daring expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst a cluster of uncharted systems.  The risks were immense – volatile solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  But the promise of discovery, of charting humanity's future among the stars, fuelled her unwavering resolve.
