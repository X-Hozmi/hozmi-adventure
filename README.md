The journey across the Dragon's Tooth Mountains was proving treacherous; bandits lurked in shadowed passes, and the unforgiving terrain tested both man and beast.  Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to grant immortality, fueled his perilous quest.

The fate of a lost civilization rested on her shoulders, a weight as immense as the cosmos itself.
