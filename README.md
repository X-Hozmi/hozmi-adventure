
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his chainmail rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rumors of monstrous beasts in the nearby mountains fueled whispered fears amongst his small company.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for a plague sweeping across the land, a journey fraught with peril and uncertainty but vital to their survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, as it jumped through hyperspace.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, rumored to harbor a powerful energy source capable of jumpstarting a dying galactic civilization.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae and the cold glow of distant stars, held its own terrors: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The journey was a gamble, but the stakes – the fate of countless worlds – were too high to refuse.
