
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the unforgiving plains of Bavaria.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each sunrise brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of Ys fuels her onward, pushing her beyond the limits of her endurance, a testament to the unwavering strength born of desperate hope.

Conversely, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in 2742.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps between galaxies, charting unmapped territories and searching for the fabled Kryll crystals, a power source capable of saving his dying home planet.  Instead of bandits, Jax faces cosmic storms that threaten to rip his vessel apart, and alien lifeforms both beautiful and deadly.  The vastness of space is a terrifying, breathtaking landscape, but the hope of salvation, a beacon burning brighter than any star, propels him through the unending void.
