
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis said to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the dangers that lay between him and his dream, a perilous journey across a land both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory in his relentless pursuit of the legendary city.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped Kepler-186f system, a journey that would take her across galaxies, facing unpredictable gravitational anomalies and potential encounters with unknown alien life.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a constant undercurrent of danger, demanding both courage and unwavering skill from her and her crew.
