
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow her whole, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any human.  Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, fueled her onward.  The whispered tales of the city's wonders, traded amongst weary travelers around crackling fires, were a compass guiding her through the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and risking encounters with the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  The vast emptiness of space, peppered with the pinpricks of distant suns, was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly lonely.  The hum of the ship's engines and the chirping of her AI companion, Orion, were the only constants in a universe brimming with uncharted wonders and potential catastrophes.  The risks were immense, but the promise of discovery, of unraveling the cosmos' mysteries, spurred her on.
