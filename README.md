
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the muddy track a ribbon cutting through the unforgiving French countryside.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred them onward, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating hope. Every creak of their saddle, every howl of the wind, added to the epic unfolding before them.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, punctuated by the chilling silence of interstellar space.  Yet, the potential reward – a new home for humanity – outweighed the risks, fueling their journey across unimaginable distances and fueling an adventure beyond the wildest medieval dreams.
