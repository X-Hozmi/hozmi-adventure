
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the muddy tracks treacherous, and the nights, spent huddled around meager fires, chilled to the bone.  Yet, the spirit of adventure burned bright within them, fueled by tales of legendary saints and the promise of spiritual redemption at journey's end.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose in their arduous trek across the English countryside.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a calculated risk, a perilous voyage through uncharted space.  Warp drives hummed, battling gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Sir Gareth's journey, Eva faced a different kind of peril: the vast, unknowable expanse of the universe, the loneliness of interstellar travel, and the constant pressure of ensuring the safe return of her crew.
