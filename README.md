
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the whispers of Eldoria's ancient magic, of untold riches and forgotten knowledge, spurred her on, each hardship a step closer to the legendary city.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the jump gates were temperamental beasts, prone to malfunctions that could send a vessel adrift in the unforgiving void between galaxies.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly indigenous life. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, presented its own unique dangers, a far cry from the more grounded challenges of medieval journeys.
