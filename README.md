The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, promising both peril and untold riches.  He’d heard whispers of a lost city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts, a destination that fuelled his every aching muscle and spurred him on despite the oppressive heat and the ever-present threat of bandits.
