
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armour gleaming faintly in the weak sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The King's summons to the far north, a whispered rumour of a forgotten city brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, had driven him from the comfort of his castle.  Days bled into weeks, the journey a tapestry woven with the camaraderie of his men, the fear of bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the awe-inspiring beauty of untouched landscapes.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for colonization.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling brilliance of distant suns, held a different kind of fear than any medieval knight had known.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fuelled her every action.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown depths of the cosmos.
