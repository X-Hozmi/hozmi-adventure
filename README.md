
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight.  Rumors of a lost monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance from a passing knight, added to the thrill of the unknown. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences in her quest for glory and discovery.  The thrill of the open road, of venturing beyond the familiar, was a potent elixir, fueling her spirit despite the hardships.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate raids were everyday occurrences. The hum of the hyperdrive and the alien constellations painted across the viewport were familiar sights, yet the prospect of discovering a new habitable world, a new civilization, still sent a shiver of excitement down her spine.  Each hyperspace jump was a leap into the vast unknown, a gamble rewarded by the breathtaking beauty and untold wonders of the cosmos.
