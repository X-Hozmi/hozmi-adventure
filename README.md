
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandit ambush or the more insidious threat of starvation.  The vast, unforgiving landscape stretched before him, a tapestry of perilous forests, treacherous mountains, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile factions.  Eldoria, a shimmering hope in the harsh reality of medieval travel, lay somewhere beyond the next horizon.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a distant planet promising the salvation of a dying Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of intergalactic travel permits and the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies.  Yet, the potential for a new beginning, a new home for humanity, fueled her unwavering determination as the vast, star-dusted canvas of space scrolled past her cockpit window.
