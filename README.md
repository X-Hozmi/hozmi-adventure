The dust of the King's Road choked him, but the thrill of his quest – to find the mythical Sunstone hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains – spurred him on.

Warp drives hummed, galaxies blurred into streaks of light as she navigated the treacherous currents of space, the weight of her crew and the fate of humanity resting on her shoulders.
