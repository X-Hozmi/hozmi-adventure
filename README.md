The dusty track, barely a trail in places, wound through a landscape as unforgiving as it was beautiful.  He'd traded the comforts of his castle for the thrill of the unknown, a quest to find the legendary Sunstone hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains.

But the potential rewards – unlocking the secrets of the galaxy – made the perilous journey a necessary gamble.
