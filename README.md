
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate race against a creeping plague that stalked their heels.  Each sunrise brought the fear of bandits or disease closer, but the unwavering faith of Gareth and the youthful hope of Thomas spurred them onwards through dense forests, across treacherous mountains, and past villages clinging precariously to life. The promise of salvation, and the unknown dangers ahead, fueled their arduous land journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with perilous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes.  Navigating by the faint signals of a distress beacon, Eva and her crew faced the alien landscapes of uncharted planets and the potential hostility of unknown civilizations.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, offered a vastly different, but equally challenging, type of medieval-style adventure.
