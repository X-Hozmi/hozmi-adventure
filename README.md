
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald’s worn boots pounded the rutted track, his gaze fixed on the shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of the unknown spurred him onward, each sunrise a new challenge in this brutal, beautiful land.  He carried with him not only a sword, but the hope of glory and the whispered prayers of his people.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky blackness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life.  But the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her and her crew, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.  Their mission was not conquest, but exploration, the charting of a new frontier for humankind.
