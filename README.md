
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the skeletal remains of a long-dead castle looming in the distance.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of sanctuary in a far-off kingdom.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harsher realities of famine and disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a desperate gamble against the certain misery of her homeland.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic map of the Andromeda galaxy shimmering before him. His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, was ready to jump.  The mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Facing the dangers of uncharted nebulae, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of engine failure, Rexx knew this voyage was a one-way ticket to oblivion for many, yet the allure of discovery, the intoxicating promise of unimaginable wonders, surpassed even the fear of cosmic annihilation.
