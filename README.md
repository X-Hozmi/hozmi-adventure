
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was proving far more perilous than expected.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the relentless rain threatened to mire their horses.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages.  The lure of the sacred city, however, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f.  The journey was a test of both skill and courage, navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The promise of scientific advancement, however, and the chance to unravel a galaxy-spanning mystery, spurred her onward toward the unknown.
