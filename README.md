Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest, where whispers of brigands and mythical beasts kept them perpetually vigilant. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious camp pitched under a vast and indifferent sky.  Their quest was not for glory, but for faith, and the road was paved with hardship and the constant threat of the unknown.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding both cutting-edge technology and unwavering courage.  The vastness of space, peppered with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of space pirates, made each jump to hyperspace a gamble.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of finding new worlds and sentient life, fueled her unwavering dedication to the perilous, exhilarating voyage.
