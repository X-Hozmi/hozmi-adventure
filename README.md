
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Iberian plains stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a chipped map, a guide to the legendary city of  Zaragoza, rumored to hold the secret to her family's lost fortune.  Bandits, scorching heat, and treacherous mountain passes were just some of the challenges she faced on this arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the ever-present threat of human cruelty.  But the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of adventure in the wind, propelled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space, a journey across light years and potentially hazardous uncharted territories.  Advanced technology eased some burdens, but the vastness of space presented unique dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms. Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the cosmic unknown,  but the insatiable human hunger for exploration burned bright within her, echoing the spirit of those medieval adventurers who dared to chase shadows across their own world.
