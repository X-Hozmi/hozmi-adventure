
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the Castilian plains.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving landscape itself.  But the whispered tales of Eldoria’s healing powers fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out new habitable worlds for a humanity stretched thin across the cosmos.  The jump to hyperspace was a shuddering lurch, followed by the serene beauty of unimaginable star clusters.  Yet, the unknown remained a constant companion – rogue asteroids, uncharted gravitational anomalies, and the chilling possibility of encountering other sentient life, friendly or otherwise.  Each jump was a gamble, but the promise of discovery spurred her crew onward.
