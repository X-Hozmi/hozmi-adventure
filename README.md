
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him and his small band across treacherous mountain passes and through whispering forests haunted by bandits and worse.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine possessing miraculous healing properties, was a dangerous one, each sunrise bringing the fresh terror of unknown challenges – from the gnawing hunger in their bellies to the potential ambush lurking in every shadow-drenched copse.  Their only compass was the unwavering faith in their goal.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula aboard the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her journey, a trade expedition spanning galaxies, was fraught with its own perils.  Warp-jumps risked catastrophic spatial anomalies, pirate attacks were a constant threat, and the alien landscapes of uncharted planets held mysteries far more terrifying than any medieval bandit.  Yet, Elara pressed on, driven by a thirst for discovery and the lucrative promise of Xylossian spice – a commodity worth more than any king's ransom.
