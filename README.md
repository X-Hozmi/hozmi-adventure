
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a crumbling kingdom and a vengeful lord.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both peril and the promise of the unknown, a journey that tested her spirit as much as her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling of distant galaxies, felt both awe-inspiring and isolating.  The adventure, however, was less about physical endurance and more about outsmarting the unpredictable hazards of the cosmos and the rival factions vying for the same prize.
