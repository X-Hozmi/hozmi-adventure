
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of adventure, a thrill in the face of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers a balm against the harsh realities of the medieval road.  The stories they shared, the sights they witnessed, etched themselves into her soul, a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  Facing unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions,  Nova navigated the cosmos with a cool precision honed by years of training.  The vastness of space, peppered with breathtaking celestial phenomena and the promise of new discoveries, fueled her adventurous spirit, a testament to humankind’s relentless drive to explore the infinite frontier.
