
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I crested the hill, the vast, snow-covered Carpathian Mountains stretching before me like a slumbering beast.  My destination: Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones in the taverns of Prague.  Ahead lay perilous passes, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts. But the lure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, burned brighter than any fear. Each step was a gamble, a choice between safety and the intoxicating promise of adventure.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Beyond the viewport, a swirling vortex of impossible colours marked the jump point to Xylos.  My mission: recover a lost artifact from a forgotten temple on a planet orbiting a binary sun. The galaxy held infinite wonders, yet also unimaginable dangers; hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable celestial phenomena, and the ever-present risk of ship malfunction in the vast emptiness of space.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration, made the risks worthwhile. The cosmos awaited.
