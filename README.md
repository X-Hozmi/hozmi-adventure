
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she spurred her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a chipped map, leading her towards a rumored monastery holding ancient secrets. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this pilgrimage, but the whisper of forbidden knowledge fueled her onward, a burning ember against the chill of the approaching night.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers lurking in the void, and battling the unpredictable warp currents were all part of the journey.  The vast expanse of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held the promise of untold discoveries, new civilizations, and the chance to answer humanity’s oldest questions – a grand adventure measured not in miles, but in light years.
