
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid from the King against the encroaching bandits. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and promise – a chance encounter with a wandering knight, or a deadly ambush in a moonless night.  The journey was a tapestry woven with fear, resilience, and the unwavering determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's advanced AI.  The vastness of space offered a stark beauty, yet the isolation was palpable. The thrill of exploration was tempered by the ever-present awareness of the unknown, the potential for catastrophic system failures, and the loneliness of venturing where no human had gone before.
