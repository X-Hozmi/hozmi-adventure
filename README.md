
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the battlefield he’d left behind.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse—the disease itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with peril and hope, a desperate gamble against the grim hand of fate.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos still clinging to the hull.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by the void decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was a daily occurrence. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held mysteries far grander than any medieval knight could have imagined.  Yet, the human drive for exploration, for the chance of discovery and salvation, remained the same across the millennia.
