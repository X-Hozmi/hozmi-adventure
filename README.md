
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispered rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, fueled her relentless journey.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown pushed her onward, the image of untold riches and ancient secrets a beacon in the harsh landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet, a verdant jewel hidden amongst the nebulae.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was commonplace; the true danger lay in the uncharted territories, teeming with unknown lifeforms and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Eva’s resolve, fueled by the hope of a new beginning for humanity, burned brighter than any supernova.
