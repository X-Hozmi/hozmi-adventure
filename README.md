
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Castile, her only companions the creak of her saddle and the insistent buzz of flies.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving elements, but the promise of the fabled city of Samarkand – rumored to hold the key to her family's lost fortune – fuels her relentless journey.  She navigates treacherous mountain passes, barters with suspicious merchants, and sleeps under a sky ablaze with unfamiliar constellations, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the Xylos Nebula in the starship *Stardust*.  His mission: to chart unexplored sectors and locate habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines of time, yet the challenges remain:  unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction.  Each jump to a new system carries the thrill of discovery, a gamble against the vast, unknowable expanse of space, but the possibility of finding a new Eden for mankind makes the risks worthwhile.
