
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, where the road itself was a constant, perilous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f.  Navigation charts were unreliable, and the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula presented constant challenges.  Facing down space pirates and navigating asteroid fields, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering determination. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a terrifying and unforgiving frontier, a testament to the ceaseless allure and peril of interstellar exploration.
