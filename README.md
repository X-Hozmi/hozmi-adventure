
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for banditry or worse. Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the sting of sun and the gnawing hunger, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of the dying star painting his starship's hull in fiery hues.  His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet choked by toxic vines.  Though shielded by advanced technology, the dangers were no less real – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone vessels traversing the vast emptiness between stars.  The universe, in its stunning grandeur, remained a perilous and unforgiving frontier.
