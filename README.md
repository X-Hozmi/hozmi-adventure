
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful Baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Yet, with every rising sun, the allure of the distant, promised land fueled her onward, a defiant spirit against the tyranny of her past.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the open road held a freedom she'd never known.

Conversely,  Captain Jaxx's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black between galaxies.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world promising untold riches and a chance to escape the suffocating bureaucracy of the Galactic Federation.  The hyperdrive hummed a low, steady thrum, a lullaby against the vastness of space.  But the cosmos held its own dangers; rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed larger than any earthly bandit.  The journey across light-years was a gamble, but the potential rewards outweighed the risks for this intrepid explorer.
