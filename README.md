
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey to Canterbury had already claimed more than just blisters on his feet; it had tested his spirit, forcing him to confront bandits, navigate treacherous bogs, and rely on the kindness of strangers whose languages barely resembled his own.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista of rolling hills or dense forests, each sunset a quiet prayer for safe passage through the unforgiving landscape.  The legendary shrine at Canterbury felt a lifetime away, yet the promise of its healing power spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Starseeker', her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the Alcubierre drive.  The jump to Kepler-186f was always thrilling, a violent lurch through hyperspace that left her breathless.  This time, however, carried extra weight; a distress signal from a mining colony, a desperate plea for rescue across the gulf between stars.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue plasma bursts was second nature, but the unknown dangers of a new planet – potential hostile lifeforms, unforgiving terrain – made this mission uniquely perilous, a test not just of her piloting skills but of her courage and ingenuity.
