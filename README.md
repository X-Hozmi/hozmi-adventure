
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their mettle.  They'd skirted bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, forded treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated by the unreliable guidance of a weathered map.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – the gnawing hunger, the relentless sun, the ever-present threat of the unknown. Yet, the unwavering faith that spurred them forward, coupled with the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, kept their spirits high.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The jump to hyperspace had been smoother than expected, but the anticipated challenges remained – navigating asteroid fields, circumventing the unpredictable gravitational pulls of uncharted celestial bodies, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the perilous nature of her undertaking.
