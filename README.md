
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward.  The parchment clutched in her hand, detailing the location of a legendary lost city, was her only guide through the unforgiving landscape.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes were daily hazards, but the promise of untold riches and historical secrets spurred her on. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of having survived another day closer to her goal – a testament to the enduring human spirit amidst the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system was risky, pushing the ship's engines to their limits, but the potential discovery of a new habitable world outweighed the dangers.  With advanced technology, the challenges were different – navigating asteroid fields, contending with unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the endless possibilities of the cosmos, fueled her mission, echoing the adventurous spirit of those medieval travelers who braved the wilds of their own time.
