
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The map, a faded parchment clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches in the far-off kingdom of Eldoria – riches and perhaps, escape from the suffocating grip of his past.  Each creak of the mule’s harness, each rustle in the dense forest, held the promise of adventure, or the chilling threat of bandits, disease, or the unforgiving wilderness itself. His journey was a gamble against the odds, a desperate quest for fortune and a new life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity amongst the stars.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant galaxies, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscape. The dangers, however, were no less real.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life forms made each jump between star systems a heart-stopping gamble, a testament to human ingenuity and the indomitable spirit of exploration.
