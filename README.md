
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant city of Porthaven.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery, for the road was long and fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching forest.  This journey, though perilous, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of colours painting the viewport.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't merely a matter of distance; it was a test of endurance against cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential for finding new life and expanding humanity’s reach among the stars, propelled her forward, making the vast, unforgiving expanse of space a canvas for the most breathtaking and dangerous adventure imaginable.
