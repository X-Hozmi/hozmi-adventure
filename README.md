
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The journey from Canterbury to Constantinople is a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sends a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of the medieval world. Yet, the promise of exotic spices, vibrant silks, and the legendary wisdom of the East fuels her onward, a burning ember in the heart of a young woman determined to carve her own path.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of the cosmos.  Ahead lie the uncharted systems of the Andromeda galaxy, promising untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  While the threat of pirates has been replaced by rogue AI and unpredictable wormholes, the thrill of exploration remains unchanged.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but for Ryla, the allure of discovery outweighs the risks, echoing the adventurous spirit of her medieval ancestors.
