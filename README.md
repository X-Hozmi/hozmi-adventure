
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving plains of Anatolia stretching before them.  Their journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fraught with danger, had already claimed two men to fever and bandits, leaving only the weary knight, his squire Thomas, and a grizzled mercenary named Ragnar.  Each sunrise brought the threat of new perils – marauding Turkmen, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the promise of the Byzantine Empire's splendor, and perhaps even the rumored lost city of Zerzura, spurred them onward.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Kryll artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already tested the ship's shields against pirate attacks and unforeseen gravitational anomalies. Now, facing the treacherous radiation belts of Xylos, Eva knew the greatest challenges, and perhaps the greatest rewards, still lay ahead.  The fate of humanity, it seemed, hung in the balance.
