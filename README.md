
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires fueled his determination, a beacon in the vast, uncertain wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  Advanced technology mitigated some of the dangers, but the vastness of space, and the isolation it imposed, presented a different kind of challenge – the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel, and the constant threat of unseen dangers lurking just beyond the sensor range.
