
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey from York to Jerusalem was proving far more arduous than the tales of pilgrims had suggested. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every sunrise. Yet, the whispered promise of the Holy City, and the yearning for adventure beyond his village, spurred him on, each aching muscle a testament to the vastness of the medieval world and the indomitable human spirit that dared to traverse it.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields was a constant test of skill, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life forms kept her crew on high alert.  But the thrill of discovery, the chance to chart unknown territories among the stars, fuelled their journey, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and its relentless push into the great unknown.
