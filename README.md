
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem was proving far more perilous than the tales promised.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease tested their resolve at every turn. Yet, the lure of the Holy Land, the whispered legends of ancient wonders, and the burning desire to prove his knighthood fueled their relentless westward trek, each sunrise a fresh challenge met with grim determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the *Starseeker*, a colossal vessel dwarfed only by the swirling nebula before them. Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering bizarre alien life forms, and the ever-present threat of warp-core malfunctions, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration, driven by a thirst for discovery that echoed the medieval knights' own, albeit amidst a backdrop of shimmering stars and unimaginable cosmic wonders.
