
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the Rhineland stretching before her.  Her journey to Prague, a pilgrimage undertaken to find her estranged brother, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present fear of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a fierce determination burned within her, fueling her steps towards an uncertain reunion. The open road, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, was her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen reserves, Eva and her crew faced cosmic challenges far exceeding those of any medieval traveler. Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential of finding life beyond their known world, burned brighter than any star in the vast, inky blackness.
