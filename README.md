
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate moor, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and cobbled streets he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling grip of death itself. The journey was perilous, but the hope of salvation fueled his every stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Warp drives hummed, artificial gravity held them steadfast, but the vast, unknown expanse held mysteries both wondrous and terrifying.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were constant companions on her interstellar voyage.  The weight of her crew's lives and the hope of finding survivors spurred her onward.
