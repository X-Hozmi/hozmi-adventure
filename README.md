
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins of Eldoria, spurred her onward, a beacon of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, new landscapes, and the constant thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's swirling colours.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Xylos galaxy, searching for habitable planets for the burgeoning human colony.  The vast distances between star systems were measured not in days, but in years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien encounters.  The loneliness of deep space was a constant companion, but the awe-inspiring beauty of nebulae and the promise of discovery fuelled her unwavering determination to push the boundaries of human exploration.
