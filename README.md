
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and hopeful guesswork, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the gnawing fear of bandits or worse – the mythical beasts said to haunt these heights. Yet, the allure of the legendary Sunstone city, whispered of in hushed tones in distant taverns, propelled her onward, a beacon in the unforgiving landscape.

A thousand years hence, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the emerald nebula swirling past the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen uncharted star systems.  Navigation was a chaotic dance with gravity wells and rogue asteroids, each jump a gamble against catastrophic failure. The thrill of discovery, the allure of alien worlds teeming with unknown life and forgotten technologies, outweighed the inherent danger.  The vastness of space was a terrifying, exhilarating playground for the brave, and Rexx, despite the sweat beading on his brow, relished every perilous moment.
