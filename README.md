The journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem felt endless, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched days and rain-soaked nights, punctuated by the camaraderie of fellow pilgrims and the wary eye kept on bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.

With each hyperspace jump, the crew faced the unknown, reliant on their technology and unwavering courage in the face of the infinite.
