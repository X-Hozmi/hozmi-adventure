
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to swallow both man and beast, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any human enemy. Yet, the glint of distant spires fueled his resolve, promising the reward of a king's gratitude – or a martyr's death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage beyond the known limits of human exploration.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pulls of rogue planets demanded every ounce of her skill. The loneliness of interstellar travel, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena tested her spirit – a challenge far removed from the medieval knight's trials, yet no less profound.
