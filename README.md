
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant Abbey of Saint Jude for healing herbs.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, with every mile, the unwavering belief in her mission fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship the 'Stardust Drifter' a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the vastness of space held perils unseen.  But the call of exploration, the lure of the unknown, pulsed stronger than any fear.  The galaxy was her playground, and Kepler-186f, her ultimate destination.
