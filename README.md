
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Serinor, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, fueled by his sister's fragile life, spurred him on, transforming the arduous journey into a desperate, thrilling adventure across a vast and unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the cosmos, but the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Each jump across the void was a gamble, a dance with fate amidst the breathtaking beauty and terrifying vastness of space. The reward, however, was the chance to save a civilization, a far more ambitious but equally thrilling adventure than any medieval knight could have imagined.
