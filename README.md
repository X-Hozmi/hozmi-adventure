Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new encounter – sometimes welcoming, often hostile – but always filled with the thrill of the unknown.  The spirit of adventure, a burning ember in her heart, propelled her forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson gas clouds a stark contrast to the cold, hard gleam of her starship's hull.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage that could unlock untold resources for humanity.  The cosmos held both breathtaking wonders and terrifying unknowns - rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors that could strand them light-years from home.  Yet, the vast expanse of space, brimming with possibilities, fuelled her determination and ignited her spirit of exploration.
