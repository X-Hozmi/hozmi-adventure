The pilgrimage to Canterbury was proving far more arduous than the legends foretold.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  storms threatened to derail his journey, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at his resolve. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled his onward trek, the promise of salvation at journey's end outweighing the perils of the road.  He was a mere speck against the vastness of the medieval landscape, his adventure a testament to human resilience.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek starship navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  The jump between galaxies had strained the ship's hyperdrive, but the thrill of exploration outweighed the risk.  Ahead lay uncharted territories, alien civilizations, and the potential for discovery that surpassed even the wildest dreams of her ancestors, those medieval pilgrims who dared to traverse their own, far smaller, world.
