Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones by caravan traders – a place said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape were her constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the perilous journey, spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each scrape of rock against metal, fueled her determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast, inky blackness pressed in on him, the only company the hum of the ship's engines and the ghostly whispers of cosmic radiation.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like him. But the potential rewards, a revolution in interstellar travel, made the risks worthwhile.  The frontier called, and Razor answered.
