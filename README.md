
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Michael, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, from navigating swampy bogs to negotiating with suspicious villagers, all while the weight of his sacred mission bears down.  The reward, however, is worth the risk; the salvation of his kingdom may depend on his success.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a dwindling human population.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate attacks, and deciphering ancient alien signals are all in a day's work.  The vastness of space presents a constant challenge, the isolation a gnawing weight, yet the possibility of discovery – a new home amongst the stars – fuels her tireless journey, a testament to humanity's enduring spirit of exploration.
