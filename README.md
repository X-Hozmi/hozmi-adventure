
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the sparse scrub, holds the potential for banditry, disease, or worse – the whispered threat of the plague that stalks the land.  Our destination, the fabled city of Damascus, feels as distant and unreal as a dream, yet the lure of its silks, spices, and untold riches pushes us onward, a hardy band facing the unforgiving realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship cutting through the inky blackness of space, hurtles towards Kepler-186f.  Millions of miles separate us from Earth, the pale blue dot a fading memory in the viewport.  The crew, a diverse team of explorers and scientists, faces challenges as formidable as any medieval knight –  navigating asteroid fields, repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen, and facing the unknown terrors that might lurk on this potentially habitable exoplanet.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery fuels our tireless pursuit of the new frontier.
