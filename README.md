
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her mule across the parched landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored Sunken City of Ys.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrubland, sharpens her senses, heightening the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself are obstacles she must overcome – yet the whispered legends of forgotten treasures and untold magic fuel her relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Faster-than-light drives hum, a constant thrumming counterpoint to the silence of the void.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The risks are immense – hostile alien life, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present danger of system failure – but the potential rewards, the chance to reunite a lost civilization, make it a voyage worth risking everything for.
