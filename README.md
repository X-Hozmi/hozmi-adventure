
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had transformed into a desperate flight.  News of the Black Death's advance, carried on the whispers of panicked peasants, spurred them relentlessly across the muddy tracks. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the long grass, heightened the sense of peril, their destination a distant glimmer of hope against the looming shadow of death.  Every sunrise brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present fear of the unseen plague.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was jarring, but the breathtaking vista of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies was a familiar awe.  The real dangers, however, lay not in the majestic expanse of space, but in the unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the possibility of encountering hostile alien life forms near the Kepler system.  The success of her mission hinged on precision navigation, quick thinking, and a hefty dose of courage in the face of the unknown.
