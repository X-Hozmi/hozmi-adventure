
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band crested the hill, the spires of the rumored lost city of Eldoria shimmering in the distance.  Their journey had been brutal – weeks spent traversing treacherous mountain passes, battling bandits, and weathering relentless storms.  Each footsore step was a testament to their unwavering resolve, fueled by tales of Eldoria’s legendary treasures and the promise of glory awaiting the brave few who reached it.  The weight of their packs felt less burdensome now, replaced by a thrill of anticipation –  the culmination of months of hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts were unreliable, relying on ancient, often conflicting, alien cartography.  Cosmic radiation bombarded the ship’s hull, and asteroid fields presented a constant, deadly threat.  Yet, the vastness of space, the alien beauty of nebulae, and the relentless pursuit of scientific discovery kept her and her crew forging onward, bravely charting a course into the unknown depths of the galaxy.
