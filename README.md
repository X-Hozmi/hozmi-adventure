
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and the King's decree – a perilous mission to deliver a message to the besieged city of Almeria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandit, beast, or worse.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the sheer freedom of the open road, fuelled her onward, a knight errant on a quest no less grand than the tales whispered around crackling fires at night.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  The hum of the warp drive, the crackle of comms, the vast, unknowable emptiness outside – these were the constants of her existence, a far cry from the medieval plains, yet the spirit of adventure, the unwavering pursuit of a distant goal, remained the same.
