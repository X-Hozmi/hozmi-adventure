
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, a patchwork of whispered rumors and hastily sketched landmarks, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  This journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had already claimed more than just her comfort; it had tested the very limits of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Starfire' Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his breath misting in the recycled air.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a promising terraforming candidate, had been rough, the gravitational stresses leaving the crew shaken but unharmed.  Ahead lay the challenge of navigating the planet's treacherous atmosphere and establishing a stable foothold, a far cry from the romanticized visions of easy colonization. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, offered both incredible opportunity and unimaginable peril.
