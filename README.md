The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving wilderness separating the Kingdom of Eldoria from the rumored lost city of Zerzura.

Yet, the lure of untold riches and legendary artifacts fueled his relentless journey, pushing him further into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-lost research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.

The true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the mysterious energy signatures emanating from Kepler-186f itself.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but it was a dangerous and unforgiving place, testing the limits of human ingenuity and courage.
