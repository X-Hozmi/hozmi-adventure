
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Black Forest, a place whispered to hold the key to a powerful ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, fueled his weary body and unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the peril of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship's hull as she navigated asteroid fields and navigated treacherous gravitational currents.  The vast, inky expanse of space, dotted with the distant pinpricks of countless stars, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknown.  Her courage, and the unwavering hope of discovery, propelled her forward into the infinite void.
