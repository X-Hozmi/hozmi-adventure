
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Silas, crested the ridge.  Below lay a valley cloaked in the emerald green of spring, promising respite from the harsh, unforgiving mountains they'd traversed. Their journey to the fabled city of Ys, a whispered legend amongst traders, had been fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of riches and adventure, spurred them onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cutting a path through the cosmic dust.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a marathon, not a sprint; weeks spent in the cold, sterile confines of the ship, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders unseen by human eyes.  Each jump through hyperspace was a calculated risk, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovering a new, habitable world fueled her crew’s determination, making the vast emptiness of space a thrilling, and sometimes terrifying, canvas for their ambitions.
