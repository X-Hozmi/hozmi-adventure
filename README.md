
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the cobblestones of a nameless village.  Her quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the abbey in Avignon, led her across treacherous mountain passes and sprawling forests teeming with bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating by the stars, and bartering for meager sustenance in isolated hamlets.  The weight of her burden was matched only by the weight of her responsibility, a constant pressure against the exhilaration of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Rexa 'Storm' Vashti piloted her starship, 'The Wanderer,' across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate factions was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies.  The vastness of the cosmos was a daunting, beautiful terror, a stark contrast to the close-knit camaraderie within her crew, bound together by shared risk and the promise of untold discoveries.
