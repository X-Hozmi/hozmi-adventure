
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the weight of responsibility spurred her onward, the breathtaking vistas a fleeting distraction from the ever-present dangers of the medieval road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart a previously unexplored sector of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey across light-years of unmapped space.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the anxieties of the crew as they navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held the promise of unimaginable discoveries, but also the constant threat of the unknown, a different kind of adventure compared to Elara’s, but equally perilous in its own right.
