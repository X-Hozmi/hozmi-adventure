
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the insidious grip of disease itself.  The journey was perilous, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward, a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded light-years from known space.  Warp jumps were treacherous, the void a constant threat, and alien encounters unpredictable, ranging from benevolent trading guilds to hostile space pirates. Yet, the potential to reunite with long-lost kin, to uncover the secrets of a forgotten world, fueled her resolve, pushing her and her crew to the very edges of known space and beyond.
