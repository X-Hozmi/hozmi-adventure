
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her relentless journey.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her. Yet, the whisper of adventure, the possibility of uncovering forgotten wonders, spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way. Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace, but the thrill of discovery remained undiminished.  Her mission: to chart unmapped star systems, searching for habitable planets and lost alien civilizations.  The vastness of space, the unknown lurking behind each newly discovered star, held a different kind of peril than Elara faced, but the same adventurous spirit, the same insatiable curiosity, burned bright within Ryla's heart.
