
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked them like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every hardship overcome, the knight’s spirit burned brighter, fueled by faith and the allure of the distant shrine.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a newly-colonized planet on the edge of known space.  The journey wasn't just about distance; it was a gamble against hyperspace anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes demanded precision and courage, a test of both technological prowess and human resilience against the vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos.
