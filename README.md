
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crested the hill.  Before them stretched the unforgiving expanse of the Rhône valley, a ribbon of green snaking through sun-baked earth.  Their journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered promises of healing and a desperate need to escape a failing harvest, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each weary mile, Elara's spirit burned brighter, fueled by the unwavering hope of a better future, a future she was determined to reach, one grueling step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station orbiting Xylos's fourth moon.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate freighter was all in a day's work for Comet.  The vast, alien landscapes unfolding outside her viewport – swirling gases, distant galaxies blazing with unimaginable light – filled her with a sense of wonder that dwarfed the danger.  The universe was a vast, unpredictable ocean, and Comet, her trusty ship her loyal steed, was ready to chart its unexplored depths.
