
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, clinging to the promise of a better life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the Black Forest.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the long grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise was a gamble, each sunset a victory hard-won.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey to Xylos, a planet famed for its rare shimmering crystals, was measured not in days but in light-years.  The vast emptiness held both wonder and peril; asteroid fields threatened to pulverize her vessel, and the unpredictable warp currents could strand her in the void forever. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, fuelled her relentless journey across the cosmic sea.
