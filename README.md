Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the perils that lurked beyond the flickering torchlight.  His quest – to deliver the King's ransom to the besieged Duke – was a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching night. Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the tension of his solitary ride across the unforgiving medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was tricky, the hyper-jump coordinates constantly recalculated against the shifting gravitational pulls of nearby stars.  Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel.  The dangers were different now – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable alien fauna of Kepler-186f – but the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push beyond the known boundaries, remained the same.
