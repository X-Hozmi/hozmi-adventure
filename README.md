
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World.  Each day brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and evading bandits who preyed on lone travelers like myself.  My quest, to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, felt more a desperate gamble with death than a pilgrimage, yet the whispers of ancient knowledge and healing powers fueled my weary steps. The reward, if I survived, promised to be worth more than all the gold in Christendom.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was less physically arduous, more mentally taxing.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the occasional shimmering nebula or distant star cluster, fostered a profound loneliness.  But the potential to unlock interstellar travel, to connect civilizations scattered across the cosmos, overshadowed any personal discomfort.  Xylos awaited, a beacon of hope and scientific discovery in the inky blackness.
