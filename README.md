
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promises a hidden monastery nestled in a valley beyond – a monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in her belly, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.  The journey is arduous, but the potential reward eclipses every hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  cuts a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess the key to achieving faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the ever-present threat of pirate vessels, Ryla and her crew face cosmic storms and alien encounters, their courage tested by the immensity of space itself. The vast distances and unimaginable dangers pale in comparison to the potential scientific breakthrough that awaits them at journey's end.
