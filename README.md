
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the whisper of hope, fueled by ancient maps and whispered legends, kept her pushing ever forward across the vast, unknown expanse of the medieval world.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp jump.  Instead of bandits, she faced pirate fleets and hostile alien lifeforms; instead of starvation, the constant threat of system failure and dwindling supplies. The vast, star-dusted canvas of space offered breathtaking beauty, but held dangers far more profound than any medieval kingdom.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a potential haven or a graveyard.  But the faint signal from Aethel’s distress beacon, a tiny spark in the cosmic night, fueled her relentless pursuit across the infinite frontier.
