
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest – to deliver a sacred relic to a distant monastery – was a perilous journey fraught with unpredictable weather, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present shadow of the Hundred Years' War.  She pressed onward, driven by faith and a fierce determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigation was tricky; wormhole jumps were unpredictable, and the threat of pirate raiders – spacefaring brigands with advanced weaponry – was a constant concern.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, fueled Nova's insatiable thirst for exploration, outweighing the risks inherent in venturing into the vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos.
