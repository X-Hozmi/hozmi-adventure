
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, had already claimed several men to dysentery and sunstroke.  Each creak of their laden pack animals, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for ambush – by bandits, or worse, the encroaching plague.  Yet, the knight pressed on, spurred by faith and the burning thirst for adventure, the distant spires of the Holy City a shimmering mirage on the horizon.  Every hardship, every near-death experience, only strengthened his resolve and forged a legend in the making.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirate syndicate, Elara faced cosmic perils far exceeding anything a medieval knight could imagine.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the universe, propelled her forward, a lone voyager charting a course through the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
