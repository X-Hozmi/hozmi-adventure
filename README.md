Before her stretched the endless expanse of the Rhône valley, shimmering under the summer sun.  Her journey to Avignon, to deliver a vital message to the Papal court, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of the forests, rivers swelled with sudden storms, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each hardship overcome, a fierce sense of satisfaction bloomed – the thrill of the unknown, the satisfaction of pushing her limits, fuelled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been harrowing, the ship bucking violently under the strain of warp drive.  Ahead lay the unexplored Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Eva, hardened by years of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and hostile alien encounters, felt the familiar knot of excitement in her stomach.  The vastness of space, the uncharted territories, the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown – it was a siren song, a call to adventure that echoed through the ages, only the scale had changed dramatically.
