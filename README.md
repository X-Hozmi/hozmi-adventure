
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down relentlessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of parched earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a desperate gamble against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling unpredictable solar flares was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unknown – alien lifeforms, hostile factions vying for control of newly discovered resources, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, with each jump through hyperspace, Eva felt the thrill of exploration, the boundless potential of the cosmos beckoning her onward.
