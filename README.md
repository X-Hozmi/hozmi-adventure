
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the craggy peaks as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes swarming with bandits, and into the heart of a shadowed forest whispered to be haunted.  Each day brought a new challenge, from bartering for meager meals in dusty villages to navigating treacherous river crossings; but with every hardship, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by faith and the allure of the unknown that lay beyond the next horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region teeming with unmapped planets and the potential for unimaginable riches - or ruin.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, yet the dangers remained.  Rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravity wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  But for Jax and her crew, the thrill of discovery, the sheer audacity of pushing the boundaries of known space, outweighed the risks a thousandfold.
