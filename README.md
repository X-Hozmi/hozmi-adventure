
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her and her meager pack.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-baked fields and the occasional brooding forest.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage spurred by a desperate prayer for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the weather was capricious, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours, was a breathtaking spectacle but held no comfort.  Their hyperspace jump to Kepler-186f had gone awry, leaving them stranded light-years from their intended destination with dwindling fuel and a malfunctioning navigation system. The vast emptiness of space, beautiful yet unforgiving, pressed in on them. Survival depended on ingenuity, teamwork, and a little bit of luck in a galaxy teeming with unknown dangers.
