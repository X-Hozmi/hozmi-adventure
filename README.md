
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed and stained with the sweat of a thousand anxious miles.  His quest: to reach the legendary City of Ys, whispered to hold the key to curing his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, brought a fresh wave of trepidation and excitement, the dangers of bandits and wild beasts a constant companion to the alluring promise of salvation.  He knew the journey was fraught with peril, but the love for his sister fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a hypnotic counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle outside her viewport.  While the dangers weren't bandits and wolves, but unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien life, the thrill remained.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, spurred her onward, the hope of discovery a potent antidote to the loneliness of interstellar travel.
