
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion against her worn leather jerkin.  Each creak of the saddle warned of potential disaster; bandits lurked in these shadows, and the whispers of wild beasts echoed through the jagged peaks.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague, drove her onward.  The rough terrain tested her strength, the uncertainty gnawed at her resolve, but the hope of salvation fueled her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was child's play compared to the political minefield she faced.  Rival corporations and interstellar pirates all coveted the technology Kepler-186f promised, and Eva's crew had to outwit them all to achieve their goal.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, mirrored the vastness of the stakes.
