
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension – bandits were as common a sight as wildflowers along this route to the Holy Land.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield, but also the weight of a king's desperate plea, a perilous mission shrouded in secrecy that promised both glory and a gruesome end.  The journey was a gamble with fate, each sunrise a testament to survival against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The jump to hyperspace had been brutal, the ship shuddering under the immense gravitational stresses. Now, navigating the asteroid fields surrounding the planet was a dance with death, each errant rock a potential catastrophic end to the years-long expedition.  The search for life beyond Earth was a quest for humanity's future, a gamble on a scale far grander than any medieval knight could ever imagine.
