
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost knowledge of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled their weary steps.  The journey itself was a testament to human resilience, a struggle against the harsh realities of a world unforgiving yet breathtakingly beautiful.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vast emptiness of space was punctuated by the occasional shimmering spectacle of a dying star or the vibrant colours of alien planets.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Gareth's journey, Eva faced a different kind of peril: the unknown.  Uncharted space held the promise of discovery, but also the threat of unmapped gravitational anomalies, hostile alien life, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Her adventure, a cosmic odyssey, depended on technology and courage in equal measure.
