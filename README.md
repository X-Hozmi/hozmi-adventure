Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  His journey had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the chance to etch his name in the annals of history, spurred him onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained immense.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, asteroid fields the size of small moons, and the constant threat of pirate raiders made each jump a heart-stopping gamble, a testament to the enduring allure of exploration, even across the vast expanse of space.
