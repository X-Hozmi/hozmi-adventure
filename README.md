
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains of Aragon in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of a powerful healing herb.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the glint of adventure, the lure of the unknown, burned brighter than any fear. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new chance to etch her name into the annals of daring explorers.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylan Crystal, a source of limitless energy capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Warp jumps across galaxies brought breathtaking sights— swirling celestial bodies, ancient alien ruins, and the silent majesty of unexplored planets.  But the vastness of space held dangers just as formidable as any medieval bandit: rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of becoming hopelessly lost in the infinite expanse.
