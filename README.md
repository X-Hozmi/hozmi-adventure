
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, promises a hidden monastery nestled in a valley beyond, a sanctuary said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope in her eyes burns brighter than the midday sun, fueling her onward journey across this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a source of limitless energy.  Warp jumps take him across vast interstellar distances, each a gamble against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  He faces threats far stranger than bandits: rogue asteroids, predatory alien lifeforms, and the chilling silence of the void itself.  But the potential reward, a future free from energy scarcity, pushes him ever further into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
