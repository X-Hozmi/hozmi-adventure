
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s wonders fueled his determination, transforming the arduous journey into a thrilling, perilous adventure across the heart of a war-torn kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy. Hyperspace jumps were routine, but the unpredictable currents of Xylos posed a constant threat of spatial distortion.  Eva's skill, combined with the crew's unwavering teamwork, navigated them through asteroid fields and temporal anomalies, transforming a simple transport run into a gripping race against time and the unforgiving vastness of space.
