The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the oppressive heat.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort from his horse, was a testament to the arduous journey across the land.  He carried with him not just supplies, but the weight of a king's desperate plea, a quest that led him through treacherous mountains and across raging rivers, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel and the courage it demanded.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been smoother than expected, but the challenges were far from over.  Navigation through uncharted asteroid fields and the constant hum of the hyperdrive were a constant reminder of the dangers of interstellar travel.  Her mission, to locate a lost colony, tested not only her piloting skills but also her resilience against the vast, unforgiving expanse of space, a frontier infinitely more alien than any medieval wilderness.
