
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's small company of knights crested the hill, their battered armor gleaming faintly under the harsh sun.  Before them stretched the endless, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with rumour and danger.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary steps forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and deadly radiation.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vastness of space held both wonder and peril; the silence of the void a constant companion, punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms system, her only links to the rest of humanity.
