
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onwards.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest, a tapestry of green and brown under a sky perpetually overcast with the threat of rain.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of bandit, beast, or worse.  His quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Avignon, a journey fraught with peril, but one he would undertake for King and Christendom.  The weight of his duty, and the unknown dangers that lay ahead, spurred him on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite black.  The hyperdrive hummed, a lullaby of unimaginable speed as they traversed the void between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way.  Their mission: a perilous expedition to a newly discovered planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond anything humanity had ever conceived.  The vastness of space, the potential for discovery, and the ever-present threat of unknown dangers within the cosmic ocean fueled her relentless pursuit of the unknown.
