
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-baked fields, ancient forests whispering secrets, and the looming, ominous shadow of the Pyrenees mountains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery; bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The future held untold riches and unimaginable dangers, all within reach of the brave souls who dared to venture into the cosmos.
