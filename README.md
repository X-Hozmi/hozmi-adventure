
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a testament to the relentless journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, as were the unforgiving elements – scorching sun by day, bitter frost by night.  Yet, Reginald pressed on, driven by the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets guarded by mythical creatures.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging rogue space debris was commonplace, the constant hum of the ship's engines a familiar soundtrack to her solitary journey.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the potential for incredible discovery, but also the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown – from hostile alien lifeforms to catastrophic equipment failures.  The stars themselves held the key to her quest, a quest for new beginnings and the expansion of humankind's reach across the galaxy.
