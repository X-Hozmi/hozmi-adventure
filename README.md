
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley collection of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the rutted track.  Days bled into weeks as we crossed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, battling snowstorms, bandits, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume us. Each perilous pass scaled, each icy river forded, fueled the legend we were forging, a tapestry woven with bravery, hardship, and the unwavering pursuit of the mythical Sunstone.  The whispers of its power, enough to heal the plague that ravaged our lands, propelled us further.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar exploration, carried us across the void between galaxies.  We navigated nebulae that painted the cosmos in vibrant hues, skirted black holes whose gravitational pull threatened to shatter our vessel, and encountered alien life forms both wondrous and terrifying. Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space, a journey fueled not by legends but by the unwavering belief in humanity's capacity to transcend limitations.
