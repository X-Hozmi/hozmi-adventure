
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, urged his destrier onward.  Dust swirled around them, a tangible manifestation of the vast, unknown landscape stretching before them – a journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils he faced, each sunrise bringing a new challenge in his relentless pursuit of glory and fortune. The clatter of hooves on cobblestone, the calls of distant hawks, and the rhythmic creak of his saddle were the soundtrack to his epic adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next quantum leap.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the blinking lights of distant stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a different kind of wilderness.  Instead of bandits, she faced the perils of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes.  The stakes were higher – the fate of humanity – yet the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of the known universe, burned as brightly as any medieval knight's yearning for glory.
