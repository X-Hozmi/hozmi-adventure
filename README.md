
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of hope, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were but minor inconveniences compared to the mysteries awaiting them on a world yet uncharted.  The vastness of space held both wonder and danger, a thrilling tapestry woven with the potential for discovery and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
