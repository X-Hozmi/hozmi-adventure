
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with maps and dried meats, bumped against her side.  This journey, to the fabled city of Samarkand, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild, and the whispers of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to discover new lands and cultures, spurred her onward, a fire brighter than any sunset.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and swirling gas clouds, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the unknown – the potential for discovery of new life, new technologies, and the sheer audacity of venturing to the edge of the galaxy and beyond.
