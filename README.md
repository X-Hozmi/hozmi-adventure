
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Each step was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of plague followed close on the heels of any traveler.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and frantic scribbles, was her only guide on this perilous journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest for both fortune and a cure for her ailing brother. The biting wind carried the scent of pine and fear, a constant companion on this treacherous path.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos system was child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting her on the planet Xylos Prime.  Her mission: to secure a rare mineral vital to the survival of her people, a task made exponentially more difficult by the warring factions vying for control.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport offered little comfort as she prepared to face the challenges of a planet teetering on the brink of interstellar war.
