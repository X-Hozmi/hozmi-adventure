
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather – a map promising the legendary Sunken City of Ys. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her every step, but the allure of the lost city, whispered of in hushed tones across taverns, spurred her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the promise of both peril and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored Eden-like planet teeming with unknown life forms and potentially, a source of rare Xylos crystals vital for interstellar travel.  Asteroids the size of small moons threatened to crush his vessel, and the vast, unknown reaches of space held terrors far beyond human comprehension. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the siren call of the unexplored, fueled his relentless journey across the cosmic sea.
