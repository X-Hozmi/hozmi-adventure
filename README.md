
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as our small caravan crested the ridge, revealing the shimmering expanse of the Silk Road stretching before us.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But with every sunrise, the allure of exotic spices, unheard-of silks, and legendary cities fueled our weary steps. We traded stories with nomadic tribes, bartered goods in bustling marketplaces, and slept beneath a sky ablaze with stars, the vastness of the unknown a constant companion.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from our own.  Our mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The breathtaking vistas of nebulae and swirling galaxies were matched only by the ever-present threat of pirate fleets and rogue celestial phenomena.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted regions of the cosmos.
