
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows that danced with the fear in her heart.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the known world, each sunrise a gamble against the odds, each nightfall a prayer for survival.  The legends promised riches and wonder, but the road was paved with hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, seeking a rare element vital to sustaining life on her drought-stricken home planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew.  The cosmos held untold wonders, but also terrifying unknowns, each jump a leap of faith into the vast, unforgiving expanse of the universe.
