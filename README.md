
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of a lost civilization.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown fueled her onward, each hardship hardening her resolve and deepening her understanding of the unforgiving, yet breathtaking, beauty of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanite crystals across three galaxies, a perilous journey fraught with space pirates, rogue gravitational fields, and the ever-present risk of engine failure light-years from any known civilization.  The vastness of space, a canvas of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, held both immense beauty and deadly peril, testing the limits of his ship and his courage with every jump to hyperspace.
