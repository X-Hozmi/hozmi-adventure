
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance in the shimmering heat, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurks beyond the horizon.  Each day brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the constant gnawing hunger in our bellies.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura’s untold riches and breathtaking wonders fuel our weary steps, promising a reward beyond the hardship.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship capable of faster-than-light travel, cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos, its destination a newly discovered planet teeming with unknown life.  The crew, a diverse team of xeno-biologists, navigators, and security officers, faces a different kind of peril – uncharted space, potentially hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failure light-years from the nearest starport. The allure of discovery, however, surpasses the inherent risks; the promise of unlocking the universe’s deepest secrets propels them forward.
