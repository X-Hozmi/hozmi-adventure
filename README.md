
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales of spice and silks whispered in taverns – tales that fueled his journey east.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each weary step of his mount, represented a step closer to the fabled city of Samarkand, a place brimming with both riches and peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows, and the whispers of plague followed him like a specter, yet the lure of the unknown kept him moving.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion to Captain Eva Rostova.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as her vessel navigated the treacherous Kepler-186f system, her destination a newly discovered colony on a moon orbiting a gas giant.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates – the thrill of exploration remained the same. The vast, inky canvas of space held both wonder and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, like Thomas before her, was driven by an insatiable curiosity to chart the unexplored frontiers of the cosmos.
