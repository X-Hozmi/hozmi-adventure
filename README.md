
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and dried meats.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of a mythical city lost to time beckon from the unforgiving desert.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to a distant monastery, is a perilous journey fraught with hardship and the ever-present threat of the unknown, but the lure of the open road, of challenging fate itself, fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, chart unmapped galaxies, their destination a fabled planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the vibrant hues of distant suns and the silent majesty of nebulas, is both breathtaking and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, each new system a potential encounter with the unknown – alien civilizations, hostile space anomalies, or the crushing weight of the void itself. The reward, however, is the boundless potential of the universe itself.
