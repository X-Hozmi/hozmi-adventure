
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary horses plodded through the mud, the relentless rain plastering their tunics to their skin.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to overtake them faster than any disease.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, fueled their onward journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet with unparalleled energy sources.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies kept her crew on edge.  The immense distances and the unknown dangers were daunting, but the potential reward – a power source that could reshape the fate of humanity – made the perilous journey worthwhile.
