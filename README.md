
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the whispered tales of Eldoria's healing waters fueled his resolve, pushing him further into the unknown wilderness. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the promise of survival, or oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling Galactic Federation, a resource hidden on a remote planet beyond charted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable effects of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to her mission's success – or the Federation’s demise.  The fate of countless worlds rested on her shoulders, light years from any familiar star.
