
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  My destination, the mythical city of Zerzura, lay shrouded in rumour and legend, a beacon of hope against the bleak reality of my journey. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to overcome adversity, fuelled my weary steps.  Every hardship, every near-death experience, cemented the raw, untamed beauty of this adventure.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped between galaxies.  The starfield, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, shifted and warped around us. This wasn’t merely travel; it was a pilgrimage across the cosmos, a quest for the lost colony of Xylos.  The risks were unimaginable: uncharted wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present danger of equipment failure light years from any known civilization.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover the fate of humanity’s lost brethren, eclipsed all fear. The universe, vast and unpredictable, was our playground.
