
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious seed, entrusted to her by a dying abbot – a seed said to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging her homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both salvation and death, for bandits roamed these unforgiving lands as freely as the wind.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against the shadow of plague.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched a hole through the iridescent nebula, its engines humming a symphony of controlled chaos.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the cosmos are a fickle mistress, and Ryla's crew faced perils far beyond any medieval knight: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies threatening to rip their ship apart, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the black between stars. The journey, though technologically advanced, demanded courage, resilience, and a healthy dose of luck, just as much as Elara's perilous land journey centuries before.
