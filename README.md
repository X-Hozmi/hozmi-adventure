
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliff faces, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city shimmering with gold and exotic spices, pushes us onward.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every sting of the sun, fuels the whispered hopes of fortune and adventure that bind us together.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, navigates by the light of distant quasars, charting unknown nebulae and searching for habitable planets.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling vastness of space itself – the spirit of adventure remains the same.  The unknown beckons, a siren song promising discovery and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
