
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he rides towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test his endurance, and the whispers of mythical beasts keep his hand close to his sword hilt.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – navigating unfamiliar rivers, bartering with suspicious villagers, and deciphering cryptic maps etched on weathered parchment.  The lure of Eldoria's untold riches, and the glory awaiting its discoverer, fuels his relentless pursuit across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expansion.  Hyperspace jumps are risky, wormholes unpredictable, and alien encounters, while rare, are never benign.  Eva navigates asteroid fields, outwits cunning space pirates, and faces the existential dread of deep space, all for the promise of a new dawn for humankind amongst the stars.
