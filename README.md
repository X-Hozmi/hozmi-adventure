
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother’s plague.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across rushing rivers, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver splinter against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and warping between star systems is child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of intergalactic trade regulations.  Her mission: to secure a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on her home planet.  Though the dangers are different – hostile alien encounters and equipment malfunctions – the thrill of exploration, the vastness of the unknown, echo the spirit of Elara's medieval journey, proving that the human desire for adventure transcends time and space.
