
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies, felt like a lead weight on her back.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon, spurred her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a tapestry woven with the threads of survival and the chase of a forgotten legend.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and warping between star systems was a daily routine, but the thrill of exploration never dulled.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists, engineers, and mercenaries, shared her thirst for the unknown.  The discovery of a potentially habitable planet on the edge of charted space promised not only scientific breakthroughs, but also the answer to a millennia-old mystery surrounding the origins of humanity – a journey far more dangerous, yet infinitely more rewarding, than any medieval pilgrimage.
