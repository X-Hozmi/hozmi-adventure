
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  The cosmos held dangers far exceeding bandits and beasts – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Ryla, guided by the faintest of signals and fueled by unwavering loyalty to her crew, pressed on, a tiny vessel against the immense, breathtaking canvas of space.
