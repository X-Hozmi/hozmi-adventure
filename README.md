
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tightly.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and rumors of a mythical city hidden amongst treacherous mountains fueled her journey.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages, the sight of majestic castles silhouetted against the setting sun, all added to the intoxicating blend of danger and wonder that defined travel in the medieval age.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent hues painting the bridge in shifting colours.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Warp drives hummed, charting a course across unimaginable distances, past dying stars and nascent solar systems.  The thrill was not in the physical challenges, but in the boundless unknown – the possibility of discovering new life, encountering ancient alien civilizations, or facing the unforeseen dangers of deep space.  The galaxy was her canvas, and exploration, her art.
