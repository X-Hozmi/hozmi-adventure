
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the sacred city spurred them onward, a beacon against the relentless challenges of medieval travel – a tapestry woven from hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a distant, hallowed goal.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a quest far removed from the dusty roads of old, but no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation threatened the ship's integrity, rogue asteroids presented constant navigational challenges, and the vast, unknowable expanse of space itself held unseen dangers. Yet, fuelled by the boundless curiosity of humanity, Elara pushed onward, charting new star systems and expanding the frontiers of human knowledge across the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
