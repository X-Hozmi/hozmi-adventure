The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear.  He carried a king's ransom in stolen relics – a desperate gamble to save his family from the clutches of a ruthless baron.

Yet, the promise of the legendary Xylos crystals – energy sources capable of powering entire civilizations – fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination, no matter the cost.
