
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised autumn sky.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  The whispered tales of the fabled Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins beyond the mountains, fueled her onward, despite the looming threat of bandits and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Each creak of the saddle, each rustling in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Nebulas painted the viewport in vibrant hues, a breathtaking canvas far removed from the dusty trails of medieval Earth.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The thrill of exploration burned brighter than any star, but the unknown dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and potentially hostile alien life – presented a challenge unlike any faced by land-bound adventurers of old.
