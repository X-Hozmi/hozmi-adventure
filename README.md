
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria was proving perilous.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the endless expanse of the countryside tested their endurance.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria’s legendary sunstone, and the chance to prove his valor, spurred Kaelan onward, each day a fresh battle against the elements and the uncertainties of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a speck against the vast tapestry of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the aggressive Kryll warships, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond anything medieval travelers could comprehend.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the potential for galactic discovery, fueled their courage, pushing them further into the cosmic expanse.
