
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate hope for redemption, was fraught with peril.  Banditry was a constant threat, the forests teemed with wild beasts, and the very elements seemed intent on thwarting his passage.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording raging rivers, and bartering for scraps of food in impoverished villages.  His destination felt as distant as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking slightly against the gravitational pull of a distant sun.  The vast, inky blackness of space held both wonder and terror.  Asteroid fields presented navigational nightmares, and the threat of pirate raiders was ever-present.  Unlike Thomas's journey across medieval Europe, Eva's adventure encompassed the unimaginable scale of the cosmos, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years, and where the ultimate prize was not salvation but the survival of an entire people.
