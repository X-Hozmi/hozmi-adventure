
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical City of Brass.  Each creaking cart wheel, each hawk cry overhead, punctuated the relentless journey, a constant reminder of the dangers – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the plague – that lay between her and her quest. The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, tested her spirit as much as her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the cosmic silence punctuated only by the crackle of subspace comms and the occasional asteroid shower.  Unlike the medieval adventurer, Rexa’s journey wasn't solely about exploration; it was a desperate race against time, a mission to secure resources for a dying Earth, a gamble with the unknown that could save or condemn humanity.
