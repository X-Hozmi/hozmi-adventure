
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, pushed him through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked deserts.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the harsh realities of a unforgiving landscape. Yet, the whisper of adventure, the tantalizing possibility of discovery, fueled his relentless journey eastward.

Millennia later,  Captain Elara Rex navigated her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the cockpit.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the distant Kepler-186f system.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional meteor shower or gravitational anomaly, presented a different kind of challenge than Thomas faced - a cosmic scale of peril and wonder that stretched across lightyears, demanding courage, precision and unwavering hope in the face of the unknown.
