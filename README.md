
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the dusty road a fiery orange.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Our destination: the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold ancient knowledge and unimaginable riches.  But the true adventure lay not in the destination itself, but in the daily struggle for survival against unforgiving landscapes and unpredictable human encounters, a tapestry woven with moments of camaraderie, peril, and breathtaking beauty.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The crimson dust of Xylos still coats my boots from our last landing, a stark contrast to the cerulean nebula swirling outside the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and teeming with alien landscapes, both wondrous and terrifying. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, and the constant hum of the warp drive is a constant reminder of our profound isolation amongst the breathtaking grandeur of the cosmos.
