
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in his quest.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the tantalizing possibility of glory and the gnawing fear of failure. He carried with him only a battered map, a worn sword, and an unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a colony ship lost decades ago, swallowed by the treacherous currents of hyperspace.  The galaxy stretched before her, a breathtaking expanse of shimmering stars and lurking dangers.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Alien life, hostile star systems, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were everyday realities.  But for Eva, the allure of discovery outweighed the risks. The lost colonists needed her, and she would find them, even if it meant traversing the farthest reaches of known space.
