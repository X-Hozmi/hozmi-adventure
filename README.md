
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mix of excitement and trepidation.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey, each day a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of ancient magic.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, silent expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate vessels, and the ever-present risk of system malfunctions were the hazards of her interstellar trade route.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new worlds and civilizations, far outweighed the dangers.
