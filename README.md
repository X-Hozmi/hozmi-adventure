
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the thought of her brother spurred her on, her heart a steady drum against the relentless rhythm of the hooves on the cobbled road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a rogue planet, a journey that spanned lightyears and galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, the vast emptiness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering pirate fleets or encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies. The galaxy was vast, the challenges innumerable, but the completion of her mission rested solely on her skill and courage.
