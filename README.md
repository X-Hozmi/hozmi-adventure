
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her and her mule, laden with meager supplies.  Her journey from the shadowed forests of Bavaria to the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in mountain passes, treacherous rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes, new encounters, and the thrill of the unknown, fueling her relentless westward push to find her lost brother.  The vast, unpredictable nature of the medieval world itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  He wasn't bound by dusty roads or rickety bridges; his journey spanned light-years, taking him to planets bathed in the crimson glow of binary suns or shrouded in the perpetual twilight of gas giants. The dangers were different – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the exhilarating freedom of interstellar travel, the discovery of alien cultures, and the mysteries hidden within the vast expanse of the galaxy, matched the intrepid spirit of those medieval travelers who had come before him.
