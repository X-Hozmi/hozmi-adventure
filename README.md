
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting beauty.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the rhythmic clop of their horses' hooves, the shared bread and ale around crackling fires, and the ever-present threat of bandits and the harsh, unforgiving elements.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, a new landscape to traverse, and the unwavering hope of reaching their destination, a journey undertaken for faith, glory, and perhaps, a sliver of fortune.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and teeming with uncharted planets.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the excited chatter of her crew as they discovered new alien life forms and navigated treacherous asteroid fields.  While vastly different from Sir Kaelan's pilgrimage, the thirst for discovery burned just as brightly within her, a shared human desire to push the boundaries of the known world, be it medieval England or the far reaches of space.
