
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He clutched the worn map, its faded ink promising riches in the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers, and battling exhaustion – yet the allure of Zerzura, and the whispered tales of its untold treasures, spurred him relentlessly onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant, comforting drone. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but Eva, seasoned by countless interstellar voyages, possessed the skill and determination necessary to navigate this cosmic frontier, driven by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the secrets of Kepler-186f's disappearance.
