The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving highlands, the air thick with the scent of pine and impending storm.  Each crest offered a breathtaking panorama, but also a renewed sense of vulnerability.

The reward – potentially unlocking faster-than-light travel for humanity – outweighed the risks, driving Eva and her crew further into the uncharted cosmic wilderness.
