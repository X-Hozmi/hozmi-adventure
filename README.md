
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for food and shelter, and relying on the kindness (or at least the tolerance) of strangers.  The allure of the East, whispered in hushed tones in taverns and marketplaces, fueled her relentless progress.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate convoys, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies were all in a day's work. Each jump to hyperspace brought the possibility of a catastrophic engine failure or a run-in with unknown alien lifeforms.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy was both a terrifying and exhilarating playground, demanding courage, skill, and unwavering determination.
