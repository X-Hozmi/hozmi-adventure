
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant wolves.  His quest, to recover the stolen relic of Saint Aldhelm, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen by spring rains, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the glint of the holy chalice, a promise whispered in his dreams, fueled his tireless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a cosmic anomaly decades prior.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony was child's play compared to the psychic storms that buffeted the ship, threatening to unravel the very fabric of spacetime.  But the hope of finding survivors, of proving that humanity wasn't alone in the vastness of the cosmos, burned brighter than any supernova, propelling her ever onward into the uncharted darkness.
