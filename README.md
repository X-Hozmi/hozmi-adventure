
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Solomon.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched meadows, treacherous mountain passes, and encounters with both generous villagers and thieving brigands.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers and unforeseen challenges, forging a bond between knight and squire stronger than any castle wall.  The road to Zerzura was paved not with gold, but with grit, determination, and the unwavering belief in a legend worth pursuing.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered algae to the Kepler-186f colony, a fledgling settlement on the edge of explored space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of subspace distortion was all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer.  Yet, the vastness of the cosmos, the breathtaking beauty of alien worlds, and the camaraderie shared with her crew fueled her journey.  The galaxy was their highway, and the stars, their guideposts on a path fraught with peril and wonder.
