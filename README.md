
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary horses plodded through the mud, the relentless rain mirroring the weight in their hearts.  Their quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, had taken them across treacherous mountain passes, through feuding baronies, and into the shadowy depths of the Whispering Woods.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the glint of gold in the promised city spurred them onward, a beacon in the relentless gray of their journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, monitored the jump drive's fluctuating energy readings as they navigated the chaotic currents of hyperspace.  Their destination, Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, promised untold scientific discoveries and perhaps, the key to humanity's survival. But the dangers weren't limited to the cosmic void;  rumors of aggressive alien lifeforms and treacherous asteroid fields added a chilling element to their already audacious mission.
