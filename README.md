
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled her lungs, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village they'd left behind.  Her quest, to find the legendary Healer's Herb rumored to grow only in the remote peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, was a perilous one.  Bandit raids, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges she faced, each sunrise bringing a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Serpent's Kiss*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, space pirates, and unpredictable wormholes, tested the limits of his advanced technology and his crew's nerve.  The lure of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, fueled their relentless pursuit across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
