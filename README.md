
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Shrine of St. Elara, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send them tumbling to their deaths, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from fording raging rivers to navigating the cryptic pronouncements of ancient maps.  But the lure of the sacred shrine, and the promise of adventure, spurred them onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted nebulae were all part of a day's work.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of cosmic wonders, but the isolation of space and the constant threat of equipment malfunction kept the crew on high alert.  The promise of discovery, however, outweighed the risks for Eva and her intrepid crew.
