
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward. The sun beat down on the sun-baked earth of the King's Road, a ribbon of ochre stretching endlessly before her.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the sparse vegetation, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Yet, the thrill of adventure, the quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, spurred her on, a fire burning brighter than the midday sun.  This journey, fraught with peril, was a gamble on a whispered legend, a chance to rewrite her family's fate.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay the Andromeda galaxy, a destination promising untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and pirate raids a constant threat. But Nova, a seasoned spacefarer with a thirst for the unknown, embraced the challenge. Each jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast indifference of space, but the lure of discovery, the promise of charting unmapped constellations, fueled her journey across the cosmos.
