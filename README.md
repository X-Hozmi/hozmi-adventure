Days bled into weeks as Elara’s caravan snaked its way across the medieval kingdom, each sunrise revealing a new landscape – rolling hills giving way to dense forests, then rugged mountains that scraped the sky.

But the vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present risk of getting hopelessly lost in the infinite expanse of the universe.
