
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria's healing waters, and the knight's unwavering resolve, spurred them across vast distances and unforgiving landscapes.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers, Eva relied on her crew's skills and the ship's cutting-edge technology to traverse the immense gulf between stars. The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel – made every risk worthwhile.
