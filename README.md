
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of both wonder and peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the ravaged land, a journey undertaken for glory, fortune, or perhaps simply the escape of a life too mundane.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond human comprehension.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the cold gleam of distant suns, was a far cry from the medieval roads, but the dangers remained.  Asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were hurdles she must overcome to achieve her ambitious goal. The vastness of the cosmos presented a different kind of adventure, but the thrill of discovery remained constant.
