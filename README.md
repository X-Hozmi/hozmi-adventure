
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air shimmers with heat, the only sounds the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves and the occasional hawk’s cry overhead. We've faced bandits, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and bartered for supplies in dusty, forgotten villages.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges, the thrill of the unknown pushing us further along the ancient Silk Road, towards the legendary city of Samarkand.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea, its hyperdrive singing a song of space and time as we leap between nebulae.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from a dozen worlds, stares out at the swirling colours of the Andromeda Galaxy, a breathtaking canvas beyond human comprehension.  We're charting unmapped star systems, hunting for habitable planets, and facing the ever-present threat of hostile alien life. Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown,  fuelled by the insatiable human desire to explore the vast expanse of the universe.
