
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than her hopes.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing fear of bandits, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present uncertainty of reaching her destination – a rumored monastery holding the cure for her brother's illness.  The journey is brutal, a test of endurance against the elements and the unforgiving terrain, but the unwavering love for her sibling fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Wanderer', charting a course through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading pirate factions who prey on lone explorers, Ryla's crew faces challenges far removed from medieval hardship yet equally perilous.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the ever-present risk of system failure create a palpable tension, a different kind of adventure demanding courage, skill, and unwavering belief in their mission.
