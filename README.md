
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Constantinople felt endless, a tapestry woven with the dangers of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unfamiliar terrain, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and relying on the kindness (or indifference) of strangers.  Yet, with every league covered, a thrill of accomplishment pulsed within her, fueled by the promise of the Byzantine Empire and the mysteries it held.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the dangers were no less real.  Solar flares threatened to fry their systems, asteroid fields demanded precision maneuvering, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes kept even the most seasoned navigators on edge.  Their mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, to discover new life, and to bring back knowledge that could change the fate of humanity.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, offered a different kind of adventure, one where the stakes were galactic, and the rewards, potentially immeasurable.
