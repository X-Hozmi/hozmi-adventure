
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days blurred into weeks, a tapestry woven with encounters –  bandits lurking in shadowed forests,  hospitable monasteries offering meager sustenance,  and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of reaching his destination before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of the swirling nebula. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel masked the immense distances, yet the isolation remained palpable.  The vast emptiness between stars was a constant companion, punctuated only by the occasional glimpse of alien wonders and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile life forms, or worse, a navigational error that could leave them adrift in the infinite black.
