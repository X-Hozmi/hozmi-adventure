
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing his limits, spurred him on, a single flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across uncharted star systems and through gravity wells that threatened to crush her vessel.  Advanced technology offered a safety net, but the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms made each hyperspace jump a gamble with fate. The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed the dangers, fueled by the promise of uncovering a new civilization and expanding humankind's reach across the cosmos.
