
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bites at Sir Kaelan's face as he guides his weary horse across the windswept moors.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's shimmering spires and potent magic fuel his unwavering determination, pushing him onward through the harsh, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic wormhole incident.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr, she relies on her crew's expertise and cutting-edge technology to traverse the vast expanse of space.  The vast unknown holds both terrifying dangers and the possibility of finding not just a lost colony, but a new beginning for humanity amongst the stars.
