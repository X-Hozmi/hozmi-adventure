
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and secrets.  Each creak of my pack mule, each rustle in the snow-laden pines, sent a jolt of both fear and excitement through me.  Bandits, blizzards, and starvation were constant threats, but the allure of the unknown, the chance to etch my name into the annals of history, spurred me onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped to warp speed.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, a kaleidoscope of colors unimaginable on Earth.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to harbor a new source of energy.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction – the thrill of discovery, the push into the uncharted abyss, remained the same driving force.
