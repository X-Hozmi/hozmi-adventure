
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the very elements themselves.  He carried only a meager supply of dried meats, a waterskin, and the worn map his father had bequeathed him – a testament to the perilous yet alluring nature of medieval travel, where the journey itself was as much an adventure as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving distances between worlds.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, showcasing the hazards of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes.  Eva, a seasoned interstellar explorer, faced dangers far removed from Thomas's, but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned just as brightly within her.
