
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, snaked through the whispering pines of the Black Forest, each shadow a potential ambush.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of St. Aldhelm, a journey fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the dreaded Baron Von Hess's mercenaries.  The promise of glory, however, and the weight of his king's command, spurred him ever closer to his uncertain destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant reminder of the colossal distances separating them from Earth.  With limited supplies and an unknown threat lurking amongst the stars, her courage and the loyalty of her crew would be tested to their limits in their desperate search for survivors.
