
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the creeping plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each treacherous scree slope, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness. The journey was a test of endurance, a testament to her unwavering courage, a race against time.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust swirling around its sleek hull.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was just a routine part of intergalactic travel. The real danger lay in the unknown, the potential for encounters with hostile alien civilizations and the constant threat of system failures light years from any form of rescue. The vast expanse of space was her playground, a testament to humanity's relentless quest for the unknown.
