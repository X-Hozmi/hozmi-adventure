
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease – all challenges to be faced on this perilous journey across a continent steeped in both beauty and danger.  The path ahead was uncertain, but the hope for her brother fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa “Sparks” Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethel, rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying home planet.  The journey stretched across light-years, requiring precise calculations, daring jumps through wormholes, and constant vigilance against pirate raiders and unpredictable celestial phenomena. The vastness of space, though breathtaking, was also a lonely and unforgiving expanse, testing even the most hardened explorer’s resolve.
