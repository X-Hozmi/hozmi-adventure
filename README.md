
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a battered map, its edges frayed, promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  His journey had already claimed three companions, to fever, banditry, and the unforgiving desert sun.  Each sunrise brought the stark beauty of a landscape both breathtaking and perilous, a constant test of endurance against starvation, hostile natives, and the ever-present threat of the unknown. This was the reality of medieval travel – a desperate gamble against the odds, where courage and cunning often mattered more than any sword.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey*, a speck of metal against the cosmic canvas of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, searching for habitable planets.  The journey was measured in lightyears, not miles,  and the dangers were not bandits or disease, but gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the chilling emptiness of space itself.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a thrilling gamble with the fabric of reality, where the only map was the ever-shifting data stream of their advanced sensors. The reward, however, promised not gold, but the discovery of life beyond Earth, a quest even grander than any medieval adventurer could have dreamed.
