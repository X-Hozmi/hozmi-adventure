
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, promised riches and adventure in the distant kingdom of Eldoria, but the path was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and skill, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the lonely nights.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision needed for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unseen dangers of cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormholes.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of her vulnerability, yet the potential for discovery fueled her unwavering determination to reach the unknown shores of a new galactic frontier.
