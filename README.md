
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the sacred city, the whispered tales of miracles and the camaraderie forged on the road, fueled their determination to reach their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away.  The journey wasn't just about distance; it was a dance with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, a constant vigilance against space pirates and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction. Yet, Eva, a seasoned veteran, felt a thrill of excitement, her heart echoing the hum of the warp drive as she navigated the cosmos, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
