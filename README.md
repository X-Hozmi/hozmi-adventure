
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a rumored lost monastery, its location hinted at in cryptic riddles passed down through generations.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable weather threatened to overwhelm her meagre supplies, but the promise of uncovering ancient secrets fuelled her onward, each creak of her saddle a reminder of the perilous journey ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours masking the treacherous asteroid fields ahead. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space held both wonder and peril;  solar flares threatened to fry their systems, and pirate factions prowled the dark reaches between stars. But the potential reward – unlocking intergalactic travel – overshadowed the risks, urging Rexa and her crew ever closer to the unknown.
