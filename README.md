
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Serinor, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were constant companions on his arduous journey across the ravaged countryside. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to persevere, fueled by the image of his sister's pale face.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across disparate planets after a catastrophic solar flare.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances between star systems and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace made each jump a gamble.  Alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, and the constant hum of the ship's engines were her constant companions in this galactic odyssey.  Kepler-186f's survival, and her own, depended on her navigation skills and unwavering courage.
