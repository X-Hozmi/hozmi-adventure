
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered of in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the canyons, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of ancient knowledge and untold riches, spurred her relentlessly forward, each hardship only strengthening her resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Rex Nebula steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years away, was risky; unpredictable wormhole currents threatened to tear their ship apart. But the promise of a new home, a chance to escape the overpopulated and dying Earth, fueled their daring mission. The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and breathtaking wonders, a constant reminder of the insignificance of humanity yet the limitless potential of their exploration.
