
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hastily drawn additions, was her only guide across the treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of the plague still haunted the land.  She carried with her not gold, but a desperate hope to reach the rumored monastery on the other side, a place said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the galaxy was less about maps and more about instinct, a delicate dance between hyperspace jumps and the unpredictable currents of the cosmic sea.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch from a dozen planets, relied on her experience and unwavering determination as they sought the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to a new energy source – and potentially, salvation for their dying homeworld. The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and deadly peril.
