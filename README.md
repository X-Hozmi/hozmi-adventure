
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-baked plains, across treacherous mountain passes, and into dark, whispering forests teeming with bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous bogs, and bartering for meagre sustenance in grim, isolated villages.  The unwavering faith of his companions, and the allure of the saint's miraculous power, fuelled their weary steps across the vast, unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Eva and her crew, a diverse band of explorers bound by a thirst for the unknown, pressed onward.  The promise of new worlds, new knowledge, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration propelled them across the unimaginable distances between the stars.
