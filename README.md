
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous; towering mountains loomed, promising perilous passes, while dense forests whispered of bandits and beasts. His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the distant Abbey of Saint Jude, would test his mettle, demanding not only physical endurance but also cunning and courage to navigate the unpredictable whims of nature and the even more unpredictable whims of men. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from fording raging rivers to evading suspicious warlords.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets lurking in the shadows of the galaxy.  Eva’s crew, a motley band of explorers and scientists, faced not only the dangers of space but the gnawing isolation of interstellar travel, their bonds tested by the unforgiving vastness of the cosmos and the weight of their shared mission to discover new worlds.
