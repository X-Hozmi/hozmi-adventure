
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a snaking line of heavily laden mules and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air shimmers with heat, and the distant mountains loom, promising both refuge and unknown dangers.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of charting an unmarked path, the risk of bandits a constant shadow, the promise of exotic spices and opulent silks a glittering carrot dangling ahead.  We brave treacherous river crossings and sleep under the watchful eye of a sky dusted with unfamiliar constellations, bound together by a shared thirst for adventure and the whisper of faraway lands.


Centuries later, the Althea leaps across the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova grips the controls, her knuckles white against the polished chrome, as the ship navigates a chaotic nebula.  Ahead lie the uncharted systems of the Cygnus X-1 cluster, promising untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  Instead of bandits, we face rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational fields; instead of spices, we seek rare isotopes and alien technologies.  Our journey is a dance between the vastness of space and the fragile strength of our vessel, a testament to human curiosity that transcends time and earthly boundaries.
