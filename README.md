
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragosa, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown, but the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.  Every creak of the saddle, every distant hawk's cry, was a chapter in her unfolding adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet of Aethel, a world whispered to hold both untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the thrill of discovery remained the same.  The vastness of the cosmos, the potential for both wonder and peril, fueled her journey across the galaxies, a legacy of human exploration echoing through the void.
