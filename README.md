
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds—seeds of a rumored miracle crop that could save her village from famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of a world where a journey was a gamble against starvation and violence.  Yet, the hope in her heart, as strong as the sun overhead, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a jewel shimmering light-years away.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of a rival corporation, she relied on her crew's skill and the cutting-edge technology of her vessel.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, held its own dangers: cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  But the potential reward—a future free from energy scarcity—outweighed every risk.
