
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow stinging her nostrils.  Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map – her guide to the fabled Sunstone rumored to lie hidden within the Whispering Peaks.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and familiar taverns she'd left behind in her quest for fortune and glory.

Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted her starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of vibrant purple and emerald.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby as she navigated the treacherous asteroid field separating her from the Xylos system, a colony notorious for its volatile inhabitants and even more volatile political climate. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops, a small act in the grand struggle for galactic survival amidst the ever-expanding threat of the Kryll Empire and their insatiable hunger for conquest.
