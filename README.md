Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience, forging a bond between woman and beast, and a growing understanding of the vast, unforgiving beauty of the medieval world.

Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the treacherous gravity wells and unpredictable asteroid fields of the Xylos system demanded constant vigilance.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the galactic senate, a journey that stretched across light-years and tested the limits of both technology and human endurance. The vastness of space, however, held a thrilling allure, a limitless expanse ripe for exploration and discovery.
