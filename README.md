
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  He was bound for the Sultan's court in Damascus, a journey fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed passes, rivers swelled with the fury of spring rains, and the whispers of plague stalked the land like a phantom. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more ruthless men who inhabited it.  His quest: to retrieve a stolen relic, a journey that tested not only his physical endurance but also his courage and resolve.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth. Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars was a constant battle against the cosmos itself.  But the thrill of discovery, the potential for a new beginning for humanity, fueled her relentless pursuit.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of untold wonders and unimaginable dangers, making every hyperspace jump a gamble on the future of her species.
