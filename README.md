
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, but the promise of riches and glory fueled his weary spirit.  He dreamt of silks and spices, of the Sultan's favor, a reward worth the hardships endured.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its sleek hull a tiny speck against the backdrop of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Faster-than-light travel meant jumps across vast distances, punctuated by the unsettling quiet of hyperspace.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – yet the thrill of discovery, the siren call of the unknown, remained as powerful a motivator as it had been for medieval knights.
