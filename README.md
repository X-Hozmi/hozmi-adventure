
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that prickled his nostrils. He carried a king's ransom – a jeweled reliquary – entrusted to him for delivery to a distant abbey.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape, but the reward, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy rumored to exist on a remote planet within the nebula.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr warships, Elara pushed her ship and her crew to their limits.  The vast, uncharted expanse of space held both immense danger and the promise of breathtaking discoveries, a cosmic adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers.
