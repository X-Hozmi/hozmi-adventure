
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track.  Her destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits lurked in the shadows of towering cliffs, while the unforgiving desert threatened to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle for survival, each sunset a desperate prayer for strength to continue this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscapes of the known world.  The whispers of Zerzura fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast emptiness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable worlds for a humanity stretched thin across the dying embers of its own solar system.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space presented challenges of its own: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any known rescue.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for new beginnings, propelled her ever onwards, a lone star charting a course into the unmapped cosmos.
