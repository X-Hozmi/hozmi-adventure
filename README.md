
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's writ, promising riches and land in the unexplored west, burned a hole in his pocket, a stark contrast to the gnawing emptiness in his stomach. Each creaking wagon wheel and distant wolf howl served as a reminder of the perils that lay ahead: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to forge his own destiny, spurred him onwards, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship cutting through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant star clusters, held both awe and terror.  Each jump through hyperspace carried the risk of encountering uncharted anomalies or hostile alien life, but the potential rewards – a new home for her people – far outweighed the danger. The adventure was cosmic, the stakes impossibly high.
