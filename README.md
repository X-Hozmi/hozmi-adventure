
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing fear of bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the aching reality of miles yet to conquer.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, promising both shelter and unknown dangers. We carry tales of distant lands, whispered hopes of riches and escape, but the harsh reality of the road is a relentless test of endurance, a trial by sun, thirst, and the unpredictable whims of fate.

Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  The Althea, a vessel of breathtaking size and sophistication, leaps across the void between galaxies, its engines a low hum against the silent majesty of space. Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson light of its red dwarf sun.  The journey is measured not in days, but in subjective time, a blur of hydroponic gardens, zero-gravity games, and the endless contemplation of swirling nebulae. While free from the immediate perils of bandits and starvation, the vastness of space breeds a different kind of fear – the terrifying solitude of the cosmos and the ever-present possibility of encountering the unknown.
