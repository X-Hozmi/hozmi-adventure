
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, spurred their mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Eldoria's magical artifacts, propelled them further across the rugged landscape, a testament to the enduring human spirit that craves adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with a thousand colours.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to contain a rare energy source vital to humanity's survival.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, offered a different kind of danger, a silent, creeping fear of the unknown.  Yet, the possibility of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration, fueled her onward, a modern echo of Sir Kaelan's ancient quest.
