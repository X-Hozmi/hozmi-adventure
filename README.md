
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but the King's urgent missive, a summons to a far-flung monastery rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpened her senses; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey.  Her destination was shrouded in mystery, but the hope flickering in her heart was a brighter star than any in the night sky.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a silent path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts flickered on the bridge, guiding her through nebulae of breathtaking beauty and treacherous asteroid fields.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space held a terrifying loneliness, yet the thrill of discovery fueled her crew.  Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, but the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets was a reward beyond measure.
