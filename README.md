
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming faintly under the pale sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through a forest dense with the secrets of ages, each rustle of leaves a potential threat.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous river crossings, and nights spent under a sky strewn with unfamiliar constellations, each hardship a testament to his unwavering resolve.  His journey was a tapestry woven from danger, hardship, and the unwavering hope of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing damaged warp drives were all part of a typical mission.  Each jump across the vast gulf of space felt both exhilarating and profoundly isolating, a testament to human ambition stretching beyond the cradle of Earth.  The universe was a breathtaking, unforgiving canvas, and Eva, her crew a family forged in the crucible of interstellar travel, were painting their mark upon it.
