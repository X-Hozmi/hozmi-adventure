
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid against a marauding horde in the far north, burned in his pocket.  Ahead lay weeks of treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving forests teeming with bandits, and rivers swollen with spring thaw.  Each sunrise brought the chilling possibility of ambush, starvation, or disease, yet Thomas pressed on, driven by a mixture of duty, the thrill of the unknown, and the promise of untold riches should he succeed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, comforting presence against the breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and distant galaxies.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the treacherous nebula, a shortcut to the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The risks were astronomical – gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the potential reward, a future free from war, made the gamble worthwhile.
