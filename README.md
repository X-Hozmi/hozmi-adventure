
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads, consumed him.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or the unknown terrors of the vast, unforgiving landscape.  His only companions were a battered map, a dwindling supply of dried dates, and the unwavering hope of finding a place whispered to hold unimaginable riches and wonders.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey across lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, pirate vessels lurked in the shadows, and the unknown alien lifeforms of Kepler-186f represented a constant and chilling uncertainty.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to push humanity’s boundaries, propelled her forward – a modern-day explorer charting the cosmos.
