
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead, the treacherous Black Forest loomed, a labyrinth of shadowed paths and whispered legends.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, navigating by the stars under a sky unpolluted by city lights. The journey was arduous, but the hope of salvation fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien patrols.   Advanced technology aided her navigation, but the vastness of space was a constant reminder of humanity's fragile existence.  The cosmos held both wonder and terror, and Eva, a seasoned explorer, embraced both with steely determination.
