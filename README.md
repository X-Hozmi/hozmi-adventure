
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Sir Gareth's destrier as they traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the faraway monastery of St. Jude, led him through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked plains.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease gnawed at the edges of his determination.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, a new step towards his uncertain destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships from the Andromeda galaxy was commonplace; the vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of cosmic wonders, held both awe-inspiring grandeur and terrifying peril.  The ultimate destination lay light-years away, a beacon of hope against the infinite darkness.
