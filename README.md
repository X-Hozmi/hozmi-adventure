
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to Constantinople felt endless, each day a struggle against treacherous terrain and unpredictable weather.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and rumors of plague-ridden villages fueled his already anxious heart. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, the promise of exotic spices and unimaginable riches, propelled him forward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to reach his destination, no matter the cost.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held no fear for her.  Years of training and countless jumps between star systems had hardened her.  The challenges were different now – navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged warp drives, and facing the unknown dangers of alien civilizations – but the thrill of exploration, the quest for discovery, burned just as brightly within her as it had within Thomas all those centuries ago.
