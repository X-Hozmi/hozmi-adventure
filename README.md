
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched earth, the midday sun beating down on her meager pack.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, had been arduous. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger had all tested her resolve.  But the thrill of the unknown, the yearning for something beyond the confines of her village, propelled her onward, each step a testament to her courage and unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and charting unknown nebulae was a daily challenge, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The risk was immense, the potential reward even greater – a future unbound by the limitations of distance and time.
