
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's writ, promising riches and land in the far-off Duchy of Aquitaine, burned a hole in his saddlebag – a flimsy promise against the harsh realities of the journey.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were his constant companions. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred him on, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors beyond known galactic space, searching for habitable planets amidst the cosmic dust. The vastness of the universe, a tapestry of shimmering stars and nebulous clouds, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  The dangers weren't bandits and blizzards, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from civilization. Yet, the siren call of discovery, the promise of new worlds, echoed in her heart, a constant hum amidst the stars' silent symphony.
