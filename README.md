
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the parched plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the promise of the fabled city of El Dorado, glittering with gold and rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, spurs her onward. Each sunrise brings a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and encounters with both the generous and the greedy.  Survival depends not only on strength but on wit and the kindness of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Warp jumps between galaxies are commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of space itself presents a constant danger.  Meteor showers, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirates make every jump a gamble, as she races against time and formidable odds to complete her perilous assignment.
