
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the French countryside.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to me, a stark contrast to the sea spray I’d left behind in Bordeaux. My quest: to find the legendary lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and sung of by wandering bards.  Every creaking cart, every barking dog, every flash of sunlight through the trees held the promise (or threat) of discovery – bandits, storms, and the ever-present gnawing hunger a constant companion.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Instead of mud, we navigated asteroid fields. Instead of bandits, we dodged pirate vessels. My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light years away, rumored to harbor life unlike anything humanity had ever encountered.  The risk of encountering unknown alien life forms, let alone navigating the treacherous cosmic currents, was immense. But the lure of discovery, the chance to expand the boundaries of human knowledge and perhaps even find a new home amongst the stars, was a siren song I couldn't resist.
