
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried rations and a chipped map, her only companions the relentless wind and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sparked a jolt of adrenaline – a constant reminder of the dangers inherent in her journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape to reach the fabled city of Samarkand. The thrill of the unknown, the possibility of discovery, fueled her weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across a thousand light years.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting lullaby compared to the alien beauty unfolding outside her viewport – galaxies spiraling like cosmic dancers, planets shimmering like jewels scattered across an infinite velvet cloth.  Though the dangers of space travel were far different from Elara's – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate vessels – the sense of adventure, the yearning for the unknown, remained a timeless human constant.  The cosmos was their canvas, and exploration their destiny.
