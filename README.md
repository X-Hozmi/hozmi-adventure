
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains fiery red.  Her worn map, a patchwork of hastily drawn sketches and cryptic notes, was her only guide across the treacherous terrain to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the hope of a cure fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Nova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and deciphering the enigmatic whispers of the nebula itself were daily challenges, but the promise of rescuing lost colonists, and perhaps uncovering the secrets of the anomaly, spurred her crew to push onward, their journey a breathtaking dance between the stars.
