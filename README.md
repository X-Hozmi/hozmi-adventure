
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to a distant monastery nestled high in the Alps.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present fear of the plague shadow her every step. This journey, fraught with danger and uncertainty, is an adventure forged in the crucible of medieval life.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space is punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the occasional crackle of the comms system.  Alien landscapes, uncharted systems, and the constant threat of rogue asteroids and unforeseen gravitational anomalies present challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, propels Nova forward on her epic interstellar voyage.
