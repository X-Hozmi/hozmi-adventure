
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing village and a shadowed past.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where bandits, storms, and the simple exhaustion of the road were far more dangerous than any dragon's breath.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, though light years removed from Elara's, held a similar thrill.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby compared to the cosmic storms that threatened to rip her ship apart, the alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport were more fantastical than any medieval legend.  The galaxy was a boundless ocean, filled with uncharted planets, breathtaking wonders, and dangers that surpassed human comprehension.  Yet, like Elara, Eva pressed on, driven by a thirst for the unknown and the brave hope of finding something extraordinary.
