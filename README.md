
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming ahead.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's desperate plea for a rare herb rumored to grow only in the shadowed valleys beyond.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the promise of a hefty reward and the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward.  Each creak of the saddle and crunch of gravel underhoof marked another step closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of space.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable temperament of hyperspace itself.  But the allure of the unknown, the challenge of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, and the promise of untold riches outweighed any fear, driving Rexx and his crew across the vast, glittering expanse of the cosmos.
