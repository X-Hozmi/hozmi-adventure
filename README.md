
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dark Bavarian forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest, a perilous journey to the far-off court of King Matthias to deliver a vital message, led him through bandit-infested passes, across rushing rivers, and over treacherous mountain paths.  Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow in the twilight, held the potential for danger, a constant reminder of the unpredictable and unforgiving nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy storms, and maintaining the delicate balance of the ship's hyperdrive were commonplace challenges.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, offered thrilling adventure, but also the constant threat of unforeseen cosmic events and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.
