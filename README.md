
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – the rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the dark forest still chilled her to the bone.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against time and fate across a continent brimming with peril and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  The jump to hyperspace was a violent jolt, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  But the potential rewards – a new home, a new beginning – outweighed the risks of unforeseen gravitational anomalies, pirate attacks from the Kryll, or the ever-present threat of system malfunctions in the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
