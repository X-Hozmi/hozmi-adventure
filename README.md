
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the dust-choked plains.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled metropolis said to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the relentless heat threatened to break his men, but the lure of adventure, the whisper of legend, pushed them onward.  Each creak of saddle leather, each clop of hoof on parched earth, marked another step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids in the vast emptiness of space presented a different kind of peril, but the vastness of the cosmos, the thrill of discovery, fueled her ambition.  Every jump to hyperspace, every laser blast, brought her closer to the unknown frontiers of the galaxy.
