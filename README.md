
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the only sound the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the abbey in Canterbury, had taken him through dense forests haunted by whispered legends, across treacherous mountain passes where the wind howled like a banshee, and through bustling market towns teeming with intrigue and deception.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the comforting promise of a fire and a meager meal.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hummed a constant, low thrum, a counterpoint to the crackling comms chatter and the soft glow of the navigation console.  Her mission, to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, had already tested the limits of her crew's endurance, their patience, and their technology.  But the lure of the unknown, the promise of discovery across unimaginable distances, fueled their relentless journey into the inky blackness.
