
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes, dodging bandits and braving the unpredictable whims of nature. Each sunrise reveals a new vista – a shimmering oasis, a shadowed forest teeming with unknown creatures, or the looming silhouette of a distant castle, its fate as uncertain as our own.  Our journey is a tapestry woven with fear, exhilaration, and the ever-present hope of reaching our destination, a mythical city rumored to hold untold riches.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts through the inky blackness, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of interstellar space.  We're bound for Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a journey fraught with perils unseen. Nebulae shimmer like cosmic paintings, while asteroid fields present a deadly game of chance.  Each jump through hyperspace is a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the vastness and potential dangers of the cosmos. But the lure of discovery, the promise of galactic exploration, fuels our every decision.
