
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the gleam of Eldoria's rumored gold, and the desperate hope of salvation, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present danger of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, but the thought of the colonists, isolated and vulnerable, pushed Elara and her crew to brave the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
