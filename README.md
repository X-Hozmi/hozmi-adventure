
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the frost-covered plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy City, had already claimed several of their number to illness and exhaustion.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the relentless rhythm of horse hooves, the crackling of campfires under a star-strewn sky, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the constant gnawing hunger – yet the unwavering faith of the knights fueled their weary steps toward their distant goal.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the pathways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship's sensors detected a previously unknown energy signature.  This voyage, a desperate search for a habitable planet for a dying Earth, was far removed from the perilous land journeys of old. Yet the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly – a gamble against the infinite void, a relentless pursuit of survival against the odds.  The risks were cosmic, the reward, potentially, the future of humanity itself.
