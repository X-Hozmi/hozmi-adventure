
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate race against a relentless winter.  Banditry was a constant threat, the terrain treacherous, and the whispers of a plague spreading from the east added a chilling undercurrent to their adventure. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating unfamiliar forests, bartering for meager provisions in squalid villages, and constantly watching for the glint of steel in the shadows.  Their quest for spiritual solace was interwoven with the raw, visceral struggle for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Facing unpredictable wormhole currents and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Eva relied on her wits and the cutting-edge technology of her starship. The vast expanse of space offered both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable peril, a constant test of her courage and skill in a universe teeming with both wonder and danger.
