
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Rhône valley, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched vineyards and ominous, shadow-dappled forests. Her quest: to reach Avignon, a city whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and the thrill of the unknown, a constant dance between hope and the stark reality of medieval travel.  Bandits, disease, and the unforgiving terrain were her constant companions on this perilous journey across the heart of France.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite backdrop of space.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Instead of bandits, he faced cosmic storms and pirate fleets; instead of disease, the threat of radiation and vacuum; instead of rough terrain, asteroid fields and treacherous gravity wells. Yet, the thrill was the same – the intoxicating blend of danger and discovery, the uncharted territories of the cosmos beckoning him onwards.
