
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold the lost chronicle of King Arthur.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey, each mile a testament to his courage and unwavering resolve.  The whispered legends of the chronicle fuelled his spirit, a beacon in the oppressive darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace on her interstellar voyages.  The thrill of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the weight of responsibility for her crew spurred her onward.  The unknown stretched before her, a vast, breathtaking canvas of possibilities and perils; a testament to humanity's insatiable curiosity and pioneering spirit.
