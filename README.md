
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  The whispers of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold ancient healing secrets, spurred her onward.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every sunrise, the promise of finding her ailing brother fuelled her onward, a powerful current against the tide of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula's swirling colours, the crimson and gold dust a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his starship's bridge.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Facing the unknown depths of space,  he relied on his crew's expertise and the unwavering strength of their shared hope.  Every jump through hyperspace risked a collision with rogue asteroids or unseen gravitational anomalies, but the possibility of finding Xylos, even a single survivor, made the incredible risk worthwhile.
