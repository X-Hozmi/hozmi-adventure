
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier between me and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the whispered promise of untold riches and forgotten magic spurred me onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, indifferent backdrop of medieval Europe.  Each sunrise was a fresh gamble, each nightfall a prayer for survival.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars streaked past like cosmic fireflies as we navigated the treacherous currents of the Great Rift.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a motley bunch of explorers and mercenaries, were as diverse as the alien flora visible through the viewport.  The risks were astronomical – pirate raids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the sheer loneliness of space – but the potential reward, a revolution in interstellar travel, made the journey worthwhile.  The cosmos waited, a canvas of infinite possibility and terrifying unknown.
