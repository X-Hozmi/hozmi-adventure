
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  He carried only a chipped sword, a worn map, and the unwavering hope that fueled his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the crackle of comms, the lonely pulse of a journey across unimaginable distances.  Ahead lay potential discovery, the thrill of charting unknown worlds, but also the constant threat of asteroid fields, hostile alien life, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure in the vast, uncaring emptiness of space.  Her courage, like Reginald's, was fueled by a hope as vast as the cosmos itself.
