
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zamora, rumored to hold the secret to healing a plague that ravaged her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled her onward, the vast, unforgiving landscape a testament to the courage required to pursue a desperate dream.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: a diplomatic one, fraught with the political tensions of interstellar relations.   Jumping between galaxies was commonplace, yet the vastness of space, the eerie silence punctuated only by the hum of the hyperdrive, still instilled a sense of awe and loneliness.  Each jump brought Jax closer to the unknown, each alien planet a potential ally or adversary in a cosmic game of alliances and betrayal.
