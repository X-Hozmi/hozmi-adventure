
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The wind whipped across the bleak, windswept plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant rain.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey, each sunrise bringing new challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate scavengers, and maintaining the integrity of the hyperdrive were everyday concerns.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also a chilling isolation.  The success of her mission rested not just on advanced technology, but on the courage and resilience of her crew facing the unknown wonders and terrifying dangers of the galactic frontier.
