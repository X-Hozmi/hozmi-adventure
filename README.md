
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by mythical beasts and treacherous bandits.  His quest? To deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril across muddy tracks and unforgiving mountains, where every shadow held the promise of danger and every stranger could be a foe.  He clutched the sealed scroll, his resolve hardening with each passing mile, knowing his king's fate, and possibly his own, hung in the balance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships from the Orion Arm were commonplace risks.  But this mission, to locate a lost colony ship, held a deeper, more personal stake.  The faint signal she’d intercepted whispered of hope and survival, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving darkness of space, pulling her ever closer to the unknown.
