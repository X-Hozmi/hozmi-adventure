
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him after weeks on the road, spurred his destrier onwards. The biting wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape of the Scottish Highlands, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind in France.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the unpredictable weather.  Each day brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating dense forests, and bartering for meager provisions in isolated villages – but the lure of adventure, and the promise of glory, spurred him onward.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Unlike Sir Reginald's reliance on horseflesh and willpower, Eva navigated using advanced astrogation systems, her ship a marvel of futuristic engineering.  Yet the journey was no less perilous; navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the effects of prolonged interstellar travel presented their own unique brand of adventure. The vastness of space held its own terrors, but the potential discovery of new life and civilizations fuelled her intrepid spirit.
