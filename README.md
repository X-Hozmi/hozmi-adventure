
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Andalusia, the relentless sun beating down on him and his small band.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of the legendary, spurred them onward, their resolve hardened by hardship and forged in the crucible of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, wormholes unpredictable, and the vastness of space a terrifying, beautiful indifference.  But the hope of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of the colony's disappearance, fueled her journey, a testament to humanity's enduring thirst for exploration across the infinite expanse.
