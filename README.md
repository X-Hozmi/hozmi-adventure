
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the tales of exotic spices and shimmering silks whispered in taverns back in London.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Samarkand – was a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape to navigate, and a renewed sense of wonder at the vast, unknown world stretching before him.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's technological leap.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the uncharted, a thrilling gamble with the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
