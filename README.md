Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Zaragoza, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the legend spurred her onwards, a tapestry of hope woven against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly years ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling spatial distortions was commonplace, but the true test lay in the psychological toll of interstellar travel; the endless expanse of space both terrifying and magnificent, a constant reminder of humanity's fragility amongst the cosmic vastness.  The search, however, held a personal stake - a lost love awaited on the other side of the void, if she could only find them.
