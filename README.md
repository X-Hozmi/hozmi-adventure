
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for a struggling village far to the east, a journey fraught with bandit-ridden forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brought the risk of starvation, disease, or worse – encounters with those who would steal her precious cargo or her very life. Yet, with every sunrise, the unwavering hope of delivering sustenance fueled her onward, making the arduous journey an adventure carved into the very fabric of her being.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a tapestry woven with the hum of warp engines, the crackle of cosmic radiation, and the constant vigilance against pirates and rogue asteroids.  While the dangers were different – technological malfunctions replacing bandits, radiation sickness replacing starvation – the thrill of exploration, the unknown promise of discovery, echoed the spirit of those medieval travelers who braved unforgiving landscapes centuries ago.  The human need for adventure, it seemed, was timeless.
