
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the war-torn lands, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel. The thrill of the unknown, however, fueled his weary steps, a siren song promising glory beyond measure.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled planet Xylos Prime, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien maps were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of peril than Thomas faced, but the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets, was just as powerful a driving force.
