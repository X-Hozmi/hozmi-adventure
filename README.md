
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving terrain.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that tested his resolve.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's splendor, the promise of salvation for his people, fueled his relentless journey across the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a tiny speck against the backdrop of a swirling nebula. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a desperate search for a new home for humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the complex gravitational pulls of distant suns were child's play compared to the political machinations and interstellar rivalries that threatened her every move.  Yet, the possibility of finding a new dawn for her species propelled her onward, a solitary voyager charting a course into the infinite expanse of space.
