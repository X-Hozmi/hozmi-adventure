
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel contained little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising a lost monastery said to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of the Black Death, already whispering its deadly presence across the land.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown pushed her ever forward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its iridescent colours a breathtaking backdrop to the colossal task ahead.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet light-years from Earth, rumoured to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the galaxy was punctuated by asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life.  Yet, the vastness of space, the thrill of discovery, and the possibility of rewriting the rules of interstellar travel fuelled their relentless pursuit of the unknown.
