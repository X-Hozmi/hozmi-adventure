
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumours of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, fuelled her perilous journey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at both wonder and danger – bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature all threatened to derail her quest.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the possibility of unearthing ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its trajectory set for Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace for Rexa and her crew.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held both the promise of unimaginable discovery and the threat of cosmic horrors – from ravenous space leviathans to the insidious decay of void-born parasites.  But the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, far outweighed the inherent risks.
