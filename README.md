
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and across treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the relentless march of hunger, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the spirit of adventure burned brightly within them, fuelled by tales of legendary cities and the promise of divine grace at journey's end.  They rode on, their horses’ hooves echoing against the ancient stones of the road, their hearts filled with a mixture of fear and exhilarating hope.

Alternatively, the year is 2742. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and battling the unpredictable nature of spacetime itself were all in a day's work. But the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos held an irresistible allure, a siren song that drew brave explorers like Eva across the unimaginable distances, promising untold discoveries and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
