Her quest: to reach Avignon before winter's grip tightened, delivering a vital message to the Pope.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the dangers she faced, each sunrise bringing a new challenge on her arduous journey across the fractured landscape of a war-torn Europe.  The weight of her responsibility, and the hope for a better future, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and rescue its dwindling population.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were part of her daily routine.  Navigating the cosmic currents, battling alien lifeforms, and the loneliness of interstellar travel tested her courage and resilience. The fate of a whole civilization rested on her skill and determination.
