
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, had already claimed one of their number to dysentery and tested their resolve against bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new obstacle in their arduous trek across the vast and unknown landscape, fuelled by legends and a desperate hope for salvation or untold riches.  The creak of their worn leather saddles was a constant reminder of the miles yet to be traversed.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway for Captain Elara Vance.  Her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies, its hyperdrive a humming testament to humanity's boundless ambition.  The journey to the Xylos system, a perilous voyage through nebulae and uncharted asteroid fields, was as much a test of technology as it was of the crew’s courage.  Alien encounters, unexpected gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure were the hazards of this new age of exploration, demanding a constant vigilance and adaptability far beyond the medieval traveler's dreams.
