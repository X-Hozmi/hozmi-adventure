
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking behind the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve, but the whispered tales of the city, passed down through generations of her nomadic tribe, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a quiet victory against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space pirates of the Black Hole Syndicate was child's play compared to the cosmic unknowns that lay ahead.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying silence, a stark contrast to the vibrant, dangerous worlds they visited in their pursuit of the lost colony.
