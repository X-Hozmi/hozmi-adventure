
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, was fraught with peril.  Bandit infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the daily grind.  Yet, with each arduous mile, her resolve hardened, fueled by the weight of responsibility and the glimmer of hope for a peaceful resolution. This journey, though arduous, was her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the far reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient star charts were all part of his perilous voyage.  The vastness of space both intimidated and exhilarated him, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a testament to humanity's boundless thirst for exploration and discovery.
