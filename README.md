
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, a gem said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of the legend, and the hope it offered, spurred him onward, his gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering horizon.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying world.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Eva, fueled by the unwavering hope of her people, navigated the cosmic currents, her eyes fixed on the distant, shimmering light of a potential new home.
