
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each mile, her resolve hardens, fueled by the hope of returning home a savior.  The journey itself, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, is as much a part of her adventure as the ultimate destination.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Wanderer', its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  While devoid of the immediate physical perils of Elara's journey, Ryla faces a different kind of hardship.  The vastness of space is a lonely expanse, punctuated by the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies and the unknown.  But just as Eldoria beckoned Elara, the promise of new worlds, new life, and untold discoveries propels Ryla and her crew ever onward into the cosmic ocean.
