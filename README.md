
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him after a day's hard riding, squinted at the setting sun.  Before him stretched the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Black Forest, rumored to be home to werewolves and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Eldoria, to retrieve the stolen Sunstone and prevent a war.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow cast by the ancient trees, held the promise of peril, but the thought of glory, and perhaps a king's ransom, spurred him onward.  He adjusted his sword, his loyal steed snorting impatiently beside him, ready to face whatever darkness lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring rescue operation across the Andromeda galaxy.  The ship’s hyperdrive hummed, a counterpoint to the eerie silence of space.  Ahead lay the derelict mining colony, a haven for pirates and outlaws, where the missing colonists were believed held captive.  Eva's crew, a motley bunch of seasoned spacefarers, were ready for anything – alien predators, hostile factions, or the treacherous gravitational pull of the black hole lurking near their target.  The galaxy held countless wonders and terrifying dangers, and tonight, they were facing them all.
