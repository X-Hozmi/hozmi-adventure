
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track leading across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, and rumors of a monstrous beast, said to haunt the Whispering Woods, chilled him more than the desert heat.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpened his senses, turning his journey into a constant, tense vigil against the unknown perils of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones, a constant reminder of the vast, uncharted expanse separating her from home.  Alien anomalies flickered on her sensors, potential hazards that demanded her unwavering attention.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate convoys were mere inconveniences compared to the cosmic unknowns that threatened her and her crew's ambitious mission.
