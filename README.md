
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only sounds the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves and the occasional cry of a hawk circling overhead.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, whispering forests teeming with bandits, and across plains where the wind carried whispers of plague. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each nightfall a gamble against the elements and unseen dangers.  Survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star system a breathtaking sight from the bridge of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to chart a course through unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  The galaxy was a boundless ocean of opportunity and peril, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
