
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for her village, procured from a distant monastery rumored to hold the secrets of drought-resistant crops.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous trek across the kingdom, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a small victory in her desperate quest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, vibrant colours swirling around his ship like a cosmic kaleidoscope.  His mission: to retrieve a rare isotope from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes were all in a day's work for this seasoned spacefarer, his adventure a perilous dance across the infinite expanse of the galaxy.
