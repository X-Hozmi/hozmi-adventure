
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto his face, mirroring the rugged terrain they’d crossed.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of every forest, and the whispers of plague followed their weary caravan like a specter.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred him onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge in his perilous quest.  He tasted the dust of the road, the grit of his adventure a constant companion.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, through a nebula shimmering with celestial dust.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space held a different kind of peril; solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  But the thrill of discovery, the possibility of finding new life, fuelled her relentless journey, her every decision a calculated risk in the grand gamble of interstellar exploration.  The stars themselves were her guide, each constellation a marker on her cosmic map.
