
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a message to a distant castle, rumored to be besieged by bandits.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadow of the vast, unknown landscape.  She was a tiny speck against the immensity of the journey, her courage her only true companion.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, navigating a treacherous asteroid field between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  His crew, a ragtag bunch of xenos and humans, held their breath as the ship shuddered under the impact of a stray rock.  The mission: to retrieve a rare element from a dying star, a crucial component for their failing hyperdrive.  The vast expanse of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also held the cold, ever-present danger of cosmic radiation, rogue planets, and the unknown entities that lurked in the inky blackness between stars.  The journey was a gamble, a desperate fight for survival against the odds.
