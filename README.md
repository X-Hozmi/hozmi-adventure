
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Zerzura, fueled his weary legs and spurred him across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the disparate colonies scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was fraught with peril, not from bandits and starvation, but from volatile wormholes, unpredictable stellar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien worlds, and the promise of galactic commerce pushed Eva and her crew further, boldly charting a course through the unmapped territories of the future.
