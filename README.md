
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle parchment – a map promising the legendary Sunken City of Ys.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Yet, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches, of forgotten magic, fueled her onward, each aching muscle a testament to her unwavering pursuit.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of bioluminescent algae across three galaxies, a task fraught with pirate attacks, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of void-born leviathans.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, yet the risks remained palpable – a single navigational error could mean obliteration, highlighting the constant danger and exhilarating thrill of interstellar trade.
