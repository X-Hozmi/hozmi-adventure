The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless heat.  Days blurred into weeks, marked only by the changing landscapes—from sun-drenched fields to treacherous mountain passes, each presenting its own unique challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed glens, swollen rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebula outside her viewport, guided her ship towards the Xylos system, a thousand light-years from Earth.

The potential riches of Xylos – a planet rumored to hold a power source capable of revolutionizing galactic travel – were worth every risk, every moment of heart-stopping suspense.
