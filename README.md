
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each day was a gamble – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey, a testament to the raw courage required for even the simplest of medieval travels.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and evading the predatory Zydonian raiders demanded not only unparalleled piloting skills but also a steely nerve. The vast distances and unpredictable cosmic phenomena made every jump a high-stakes gamble, transforming interstellar travel into a breathtaking odyssey across the uncharted expanse of space.
