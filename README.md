
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague sweeping their kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the treacherous fording of swollen rivers, and the constant threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, pushing them ever closer to their desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the elusive Xylan civilization, rumored to possess technology capable of ending the intergalactic war.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva faced the cosmic unknown with unwavering determination.  The vast emptiness of space was a different kind of desolate, but the thrill of discovery and the weight of galactic peace spurred her onward, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
