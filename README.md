
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of fiery orange and deep violet.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the allure of the unknown spurred her onward, the whispered tales of Saragossa’s riches and wonders a potent fuel for her weary soul.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the colossal engine of his starship humming a low, comforting drone.  His mission: to chart a previously unmapped sector of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light years.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – the thrill of exploration remained constant.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes glimpsed through his viewport, and the ever-present challenge of the unknown fuelled his courage, mirroring the spirit of countless adventurers who came before him.
