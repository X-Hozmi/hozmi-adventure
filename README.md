
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she spurred her weary mare across the sun-baked plains.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant battle hung heavy in the air.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness, had taken her far from her village, through treacherous mountain passes and across rivers teeming with unseen dangers. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat in this unforgiving landscape.  She clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, her determination unwavering despite the mounting hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula known as the Serpent's Eye.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, rumored to hold a vital resource needed to sustain her colony.  Navigating the treacherous currents of space, dodging rogue asteroids and the occasional pirate vessel, demanded unwavering precision and nerves of steel.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her.  But the thought of her people's survival fueled her relentless drive across the uncharted sea of stars.
