
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with the King's urgent missive.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage of peril and grit, was a test of endurance, a dance between hope and despair played out under the vast, indifferent sky.  She clung to the promise of reward, a sliver of light in the oppressive darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission, to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, was a far cry from Elara's, but the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel – but the same unwavering determination fuelled her quest for discovery.
