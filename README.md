
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Robbers, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions on this arduous journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a stark reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadowed woods and the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  He pressed on, driven by faith and a desperate hope for redemption.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap, was measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years.  Warp drives hummed, a constant thrum against the vast emptiness of space. While physical danger was less immediate than Reginald's, the threat of unforeseen cosmic phenomena, navigational errors, and the ever-present loneliness of deep space presented challenges as formidable as any medieval knight could face. The vast expanse of the cosmos held both incredible promise and terrifying unknown dangers.
