
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their trusty steed, Barnaby, rode across the rain-lashed English countryside, their cloaks plastered to their backs.  Their quest: to reach the distant abbey of St. Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging their village.  Each muddy track, each shadowed forest, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the disease itself.  Yet the glint of hope in Reginald's eye burned brighter than any torch, fueling their perilous journey across the unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  Navigation charts were unreliable, wormholes unpredictable, and the vast emptiness of space a constant threat.  Yet the potential discovery, and the memory of the lost colonists, drove Eva and her crew across the unimaginable distances between galaxies, facing cosmic storms and alien encounters with unwavering courage.
