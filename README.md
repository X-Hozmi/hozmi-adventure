
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them on, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the ever-present shadow of death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing crippling damage from solar flares were all in a day's work.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes, and the promise of reunion with long-lost colonists fueled her tireless pursuit, a journey measured not in miles, but light-years of unwavering determination.
