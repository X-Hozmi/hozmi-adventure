The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  His quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a relic said to hold the power of a thousand suns, before it fell into the hands of the Black Witch.

The fate of humanity, it seemed, rested on the shoulders of this lone explorer.
