
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside stretching before him.  His quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas and retrieve the lost manuscript, felt as distant and improbable as the horizon itself.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, with each sunrise, his resolve hardened, spurred by the whispers of legend and the promise of glory, however faint.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope's End*, lost amidst the chaotic gravitational pull of the black hole at the galaxy's edge.  Navigation was treacherous, requiring constant course corrections and the deft hand of her seasoned crew.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the chilling silence of the void, held a different kind of terror than any earthly wilderness; a loneliness that threatened to consume even the bravest soul.  But the hope of finding survivors, and perhaps even uncovering the secrets of the Xylos nebula, kept her driving forward.
