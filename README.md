
The year is 1348.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty air thick with the smells of spices and impending storms.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way north, the creaking of wagons a constant soundtrack to our days. We traversed the rolling hills of Provence, then the stark beauty of the Alps, each pass a gamble against treacherous weather and bandit raids. Every sunset brought a new landscape, a new challenge – a swollen river to ford, a mountain pass choked with snow, the ever-present threat of disease. The thrill of the unknown, however, far outweighed the risks.

Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a path through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, hard vacuum of space.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or pirate attacks.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the sheer improbability of our voyage, fuels our purpose – the discovery of new worlds, new life, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond the familiar embrace of our solar system.
