
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept moors.  Their destination: the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria's healing waters fueled their weary legs and steeled their resolve against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a gamble against the vast unknown.  Alien encounters were frequent, some friendly, some decidedly less so, but the hope of reuniting with humanity's lost kin pushed Eva and her crew to brave the perils of interstellar travel, navigating cosmic storms and navigating the treacherous political landscape of the galactic federation.
