
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hurried sketches, was her only guide across the treacherous terrain to Constantinople. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose, fueling her relentless journey across a land both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that could unlock untold resources and knowledge for humanity.  But the vastness of space held its own perils - rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each star a beacon in the limitless expanse of the cosmos.
