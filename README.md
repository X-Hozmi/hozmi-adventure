
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days blurred into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked trails, treacherous mountain passes, and skirmishes with bandits.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of starvation or ambush, yet the hope of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon, spurred them relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were mere inconveniences compared to the existential dread of deep space – the crushing loneliness, the constant threat of equipment failure, and the ever-present unknown lurking in the vast darkness between the stars.  Yet, the potential reward, a breakthrough that could change the fate of humanity, fueled her unwavering resolve.
