
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone city, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the Sunstone, and the hope it represented, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the twin suns of Kepler-16b.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and terror, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, but the promise of discovering new worlds and expanding human knowledge fueled her unwavering resolve.
