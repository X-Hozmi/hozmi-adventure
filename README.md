
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and cobbled streets he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his perilous journey, transforming every hardship into a step closer to his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape and political maneuvering she faced back on Earth. Now, light years from home, with only her loyal crew and the vast, unforgiving cosmos for company, Eva felt the weight of responsibility settle upon her shoulders.  The fate of a lost civilization rested on her ability to overcome the impossible.
