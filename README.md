
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun glinting off her worn chainmail.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a journey whispered about in hushed tones by even the bravest knights.  Rumours of a lost city, brimming with ancient knowledge and untold riches, spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the thrill of the unknown – the promise of discovery, the threat of danger, equally captivating.  This journey, a desperate gamble across uncharted lands, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, sliced through the nebula, its engines a low hum against the cosmic silence.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and skirting the gravitational pull of black holes were mere inconveniences compared to the vast, unknown expanse of space.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.  The quest for Xylos was a perilous voyage across the galaxy, but the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the universe – made the risk worthwhile.
