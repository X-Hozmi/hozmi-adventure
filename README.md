
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of illness hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the unwavering faith in her heart propelled her further, transforming the arduous miles into a tapestry of adventure woven with hardship, beauty, and the quiet strength of the human spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of a vanished civilization, far outweighed the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the infinite odds of the cosmos.
