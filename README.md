
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across the treacherous mountain passes was far from over, a desperate quest to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza before winter's icy grip sealed the high roads.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend, but the hope of finding her lost brother fueled her weary steps. Each creaking wagon wheel, each bray of the mule, marked another step closer to the unknown, and the uncertain fate that awaited her.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unmapped gravitational anomalies and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, hostile alien species.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.  The weight of galactic exploration rested on her shoulders, a burden balanced by the thrill of discovery and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.
