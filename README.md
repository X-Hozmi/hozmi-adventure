
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, heightened the thrill of her journey.  She carried a worn map, its edges frayed from countless uses, guiding her toward the rumored lost city of El Dorado, a quest fueled by whispers of unimaginable riches and perilous encounters with bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  The unknown beckoned, a siren's call she couldn't resist.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with impossible colours.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising signs of life light-years away from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting roar against the vast, terrifying emptiness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates added to the already inherent risk, but the potential discovery of an alien civilization outweighed any fear.  For Ryla, the cosmos was the ultimate frontier, an endless ocean of adventure waiting to be explored.
