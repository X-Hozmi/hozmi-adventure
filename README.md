
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas trudging behind, pressed onward. Their journey was perilous, a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient knowledge and untold riches.  They navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and dodged bandits lurking in shadowed forests. Every sunset brought a new challenge, a constant test of their endurance and courage against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of starvation or worse.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy said to lie on the uncharted planet of Aethel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of wormholes were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held untold dangers, but the potential reward fueled the intrepid crew's determination as they pushed the boundaries of known space, one jump to hyperspace at a time.
