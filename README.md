This was the life he craved, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of faraway lands, and the camaraderie of fellow travelers.

The galaxy map shimmered on the console, its constellations a tapestry of the universe, and Anya felt a surge of excitement, knowing that this was only the beginning of an adventure that would forever alter the course of human history.
