
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather jerkin chafed, a small price to pay for the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, rumored to lie hidden in the forgotten valley beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting vibration against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic rays and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a gamble with reality itself.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fueled his unwavering ambition.
