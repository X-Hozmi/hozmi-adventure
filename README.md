
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume him before the disease did.  Yet, the whisper of hope, carried on the wind, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust', its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  Beyond the viewport, a swirling nebula painted the cosmos in breathtaking hues, a far cry from the muddy tracks of Kaelan's journey.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding colony, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Yet, the promise of a new dawn, a new home, fuelled her unwavering determination.
