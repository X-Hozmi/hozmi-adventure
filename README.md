
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of muddy tracks, sparse villages offering meager hospitality, and the constant threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the hope of salvation and the thrill of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of genetically engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel, Eva felt the familiar hum of the hyperdrive beneath her feet, a comforting vibration amidst the vast, silent expanse of space.  The journey was arduous, but the knowledge that her cargo represented life itself for a distant world propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the cosmic wilderness.
