
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudged through the mud, the stench of woodsmoke and decay heavy in the air.  Their journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria, promised riches and glory – or a gruesome end at the hands of bandits or wild beasts. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. The whispering forests seemed to hold ancient secrets, while the open plains exposed them to the unforgiving gaze of the sun.  Their quest was a test of endurance, courage, and unwavering loyalty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned navigators, were on a mission to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The journey was punctuated by wormhole jumps, encounters with bizarre alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of spatial anomalies. Each jump was a gamble, a leap into the unknown where the very fabric of spacetime itself could unravel. The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless mysteries, and Captain Rostova was determined to uncover them, one star system at a time.
