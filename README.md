
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of France, her pack heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her family's hopes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the insidious creeping of starvation.  Her journey to the rumored haven of Avignon is fraught with peril, but the whispers of a better life fuel her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.  The vastness of the land itself, a tapestry of forests, rivers, and treacherous mountains, presents a challenge as formidable as any human foe.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the terrifying silence of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates patrol the intergalactic trade routes, each a potential end to her voyage.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of discovery, drives Ryla and her crew ever onward, towards the shimmering, distant lights of a new world.
