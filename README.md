His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.

His only companions were his battered sword, a dwindling supply of hardtack, and the unwavering hope that fueled his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with exotic life and guarded by unpredictable temporal anomalies.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational distortions or hostile alien encounters.  The vastness of the galaxy was both exhilarating and terrifying, her courage tempered by the weight of her responsibility and the ever-present possibility of encountering the unknown.
