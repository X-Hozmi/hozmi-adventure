
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel bulging with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel and rustle in the brush held the promise of adventure, or peril, a constant dance on the razor's edge between hope and despair as she pressed onward, guided only by the stars and the unwavering strength of her heart.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs.  But the seemingly empty expanse of space hid dangers far more insidious than medieval bandits – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  With her loyal crew at her side, Ryla navigated treacherous gravitational fields and dodged laser fire, her every decision a gamble in the vast, unforgiving cosmos, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of the unknown.
