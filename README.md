
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a lost civilization's secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey, spurred him onwards, a lone knight against the sprawling tapestry of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across lightyears to the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant lullaby, punctuated by the crackle of comms as she coordinated with her crew.  Their mission: to survey a newly discovered planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  The vast emptiness of space, the potential dangers lurking in uncharted territories, and the sheer audacity of interstellar travel presented challenges far different from Sir Reginald’s, but the spirit of adventure – that restless yearning for the unknown – burned just as fiercely within Eva's heart.
