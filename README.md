
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his mount onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was proving treacherous; bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, and the relentless sun baked the land to dust.  Yet, the whispers of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, fueled his weary spirit. Each creaking wagon wheel, each stampeding herd, each fleeting glimpse of a distant castle, marked another step closer to adventure, a gamble with both life and fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to the Andromeda galaxy. The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril than bandit-ridden roads; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the unknown lurked around every corner of the cosmos. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and unlocking the secrets of the universe surpassed the daunting risks. The hum of the engines and the constellations outside her viewport were the soundtrack to her galactic odyssey.
