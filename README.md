
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains had tested him and his small band to their limits.  Bandit raids, treacherous passes choked with snow, and the gnawing hunger had whittled their numbers. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to reside in the far-off kingdom of Eldoria, propelled them forward.  Each creak of saddle leather, each labored breath, was a step closer to legend or ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck against the breathtaking canvas of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart the newly-discovered Kepler-186f system and establish a viable colony.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear the *Stardust* apart, while unknown alien lifeforms lurked in the nebulae.  But Eva, hardened by years spent pushing the boundaries of human exploration, pressed on, driven by the unyielding human spirit to reach for the stars.
