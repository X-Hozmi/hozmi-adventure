
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey across the unforgiving landscape, a testament to the courage and resilience of medieval adventurers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the Xylan civilization, a race rumored to possess technology capable of solving the looming energy crisis threatening the Galactic Federation.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate attacks was commonplace, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the immense risks involved in interstellar travel. But the promise of a brighter future, a future free from energy scarcity, propelled her and her crew across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
