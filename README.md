
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as his weary steed plodded through the sun-baked fields of France.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers, and evading the suspicious gaze of rival knights.  His destination seemed a lifetime away, yet the allure of the adventure, the thrill of the unknown, propelled him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy.  Navigation relied on complex astrogation charts and the erratic whispers of the hyper-drive, while the ever-present danger of asteroid fields and pirate vessels demanded constant vigilance.  Alien landscapes unfolded before her sensor screens – vibrant gas giants, desolate moons, and planets teeming with strange and often hostile life. The vastness of space amplified the isolation, yet the promise of discovery fuelled her courage, a descendant of the medieval adventurers who dared to explore the uncharted territories of their own world.
