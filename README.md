
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just supplies; it holds the hopes of her village, clinging to the promise of a legendary healer rumored to reside in the distant monastery.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels a potent mix of fear and determination.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey, testing her resilience at every turn.  The path is fraught with peril, but the potential reward makes every step worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rendar pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the far-flung planet of Aethel, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Zydonian cruisers, Rexx relies on his crew's skills and the ship's advanced technology to survive.  The vast emptiness of space holds both wonder and immense danger;  a single malfunction, a wrong calculation, could mean oblivion.  But the lure of galactic exploration, the promise of unlocking a new era of interstellar travel, outweighs the risks a thousandfold.
