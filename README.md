
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of France, a worn map clutched in his gauntleted hand.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the Hundred Years' War.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of ancient magic, fuels his weary body and keeps his spirit alight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling population of Earth, a planet promised in ancient prophecies recorded on a lost data-disk.  The vastness of space, the dangers of uncharted systems brimming with alien life and unpredictable celestial phenomena, are constant companions. But the hope of finding a new home, of securing humanity's future, is a beacon guiding her through the infinite darkness.
