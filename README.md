
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald and his small band of retainers pressed onward.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, scorching deserts where water was more precious than gold, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of Zerzura, spurred them on, their horses' hooves pounding a relentless rhythm against the unforgiving earth.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the inky expanse between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was a test of both endurance and technology, navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of challenge than the medieval world: loneliness, the ever-present threat of equipment failure, and the terrifying unknown lurking in the uncharted sectors of the cosmos.  But the promise of finding the lost colonists, of uncovering their fate, drove Captain Rostova and her crew onward through the star-dusted void.
