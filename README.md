
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret of eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just a few of the obstacles in his path. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing doubt that Zerzura was nothing more than a fanciful tale. Yet, the glint of the distant horizon, and the whispers of the wind, spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, presumed destroyed by a rogue asteroid storm.  Navigation was perilous, fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and pirate incursions from the Kryll Hegemony.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each new star system a potential graveyard. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, the unwavering belief in humanity's resilience, fueled her journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
