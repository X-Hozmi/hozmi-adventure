
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hung in the air, a stark contrast to the sea spray she'd left behind in Bordeaux.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a chance encounter with a wandering holy man, or the discovery of a forgotten ruin whispering secrets of ages past.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, promised hardship, but the thrill of the unknown fueled her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  The cold vacuum of space surrounded them, a canvas splashed with the vibrant hues of nebulae and the distant, unwavering light of countless suns.  Their mission: to chart unexplored star systems, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the cosmos, a risk that promised unimaginable wonders – or terrifying annihilation. The vastness of the universe, both beautiful and perilous, was their playground and their potential tomb.
