
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion against her worn leather jerkin.  Each creak of her saddle warned of the perilous journey ahead – bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable weather could turn a day's travel into a death sentence. Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled Sunstone city, a place of unimaginable wealth and power, spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape. The journey was fraught with hardship, but the thrill of the unknown fuelled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours masking the dangers within.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from their home.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a leap of faith into the chaotic expanse between stars, but the promise of discovery, of finding new life, new resources, outweighed the inherent risk.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, held countless threats, from rogue asteroids to unpredictable gravitational forces, making each interstellar voyage a thrilling and perilous adventure.
