
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her leather jerkin, worn and patched, offered little protection from the biting wind.  This journey to the Holy Land, undertaken to find her estranged brother, felt less a pilgrimage and more a gauntlet thrown down by fate.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary traveler encountered, marked another step towards the unknown, a journey fraught with peril, bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease, but also filled with the thrill of discovering new lands and forging unexpected friendships.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  This wasn't a quest for salvation, but for knowledge – for the possibility of a new home for humanity.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life – but the adventurous spirit, the unyielding human desire to explore the furthest reaches, burned just as brightly.
