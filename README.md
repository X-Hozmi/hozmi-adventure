
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than the quest itself: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wheel, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for peril, but the promise of salvation spurred her onward through unforgiving landscapes and across treacherous mountain passes.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, the coordinates uncertain, but the lure of the lost Xylossian artifact – a device whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – was too great to resist.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the aggressive K'tharr patrols was child's play compared to the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel, a solitude that stretched further than any earthly plain.
