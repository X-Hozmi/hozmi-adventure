His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Jude from the clutches of the Black Baron, a journey that had already taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Whispering Woods.

Navigation through asteroid fields, skirmishes with space pirates, and the constant threat of engine failure were just some of the hazards Eva faced in her daring pursuit of the unknown, fueled by a thirst for discovery and the hope of a future beyond the confines of known space.
