
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mare across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for adventure – bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of a world unforgiving to the unprepared.  But the hope of Eldoria fuels her journey, pushing her onward despite the perils.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Lost Colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with nebulas and the icy glitter of distant stars, is both breathtaking and terrifying.  Cosmic storms threaten to rip her ship apart, while alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, are a constant possibility.  Yet, the promise of discovery and the thrill of charting the unknown propel her ever further into the cosmic ocean.
