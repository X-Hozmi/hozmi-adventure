
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the parched Breton countryside.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already claimed several men to fever and exhaustion.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the holy city, the whispered tales of miracles and the promise of redemption, spurred them onward, their battered armor gleaming faintly beneath the relentless sun.  The journey itself, fraught with peril, was an adventure as grand as any holy quest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable spatial anomalies of the nebula tested her skills and the ship's resilience. The vast emptiness of space held an awe-inspiring beauty, but it also hid dangers far greater than any medieval bandit – the cosmic unknown beckoned, a thrilling and potentially fatal adventure among the stars.
