
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of healing, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Alien encounters, engine malfunctions, and the constant threat of pirates tested her crew's resilience, but the hope of finding the colonists, and the endless wonders of the cosmos, fueled their unwavering determination. The vastness of space offered a freedom that dwarfed even the wildest medieval journeys, a stark contrast yet echoing the same courageous spirit of exploration.
