
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little solace against the howling wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine—the whispers of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, rumored to lie hidden in the valley beyond, propelled her onward, a beacon in the relentless gray.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating by the pulsating rhythms of distant quasars, she charted a course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos stretched before them, a tapestry woven with the threads of dying stars and nascent planets. Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a gamble on the survival of humanity amidst the uncaring grandeur of the universe.
