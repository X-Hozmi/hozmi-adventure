
The year is 1348.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's decree, a cryptic scroll promising untold riches in the East, burned a hole in his saddlebag.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, whispered-about bandit lairs, and the vast, unknowable expanse of the Silk Road.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – scorching deserts, freezing rivers, and the constant, gnawing fear of the unknown.  But the lure of fortune, and the thrill of the journey itself, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space squids of the Outer Rim were daily hazards.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic wonders, filled her with awe, yet the solitude and the ever-present threat of the unknown were a constant companion.  The success of her mission, and the fate of humanity itself, rested on her shoulders.
