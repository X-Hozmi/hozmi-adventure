
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin shielding her from the relentless heat.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and whispers of mythical beasts haunted the whispered tales around crackling campfires.  Yet, the allure of the distant, rumored city of Eldoria, with its fabled silver mines and exotic spices, spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches in rare earth minerals and the potential for first contact with a sentient species.  The journey was fraught with danger – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders prowling the intergalactic lanes. But the promise of discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, and the weight of human expansion fueled her determination, making every warp jump a leap into the breathtaking, terrifying immensity of space.
