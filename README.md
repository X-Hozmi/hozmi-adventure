
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had tested her fortitude beyond measure. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger had all become familiar companions. Yet, the stories whispered around crackling campfires – of mythical creatures, hidden monasteries, and cities lost to time – fueled her onward, a thrilling tapestry woven into the very fabric of her perilous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kestrel piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents between galaxies was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure the rare Xylos crystals she sought. Her mission, a clandestine trade run for a shadowy organization, was a gamble, every jump a leap of faith into the unknown. But the allure of the cosmos, the promise of untold riches and the thrill of outsmarting her rivals, made the risks worthwhile.  The vastness of space, teeming with wonders and dangers, was her playground.
