
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, the whispers of plague clung to the air, and each unfamiliar village held the potential for both hospitality and hostility.  Their horses, weary but steadfast, carried them through sun-drenched meadows and rain-lashed mountains, each mile a testament to their courage and resilience, a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, fear, and the unwavering pursuit of their sacred goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown – the potential for undiscovered alien life forms, hostile or otherwise.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and the threat of annihilation in equal measure.  Every jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on the future of humanity itself.
