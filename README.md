
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of worn leather and hopeful faces, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, our meager supplies dwindling with each passing day.  The whispers of bandits and mythical beasts fuel the campfire tales at night, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers awaiting us in this untamed world.  Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of purpose, a shared yearning to reach the promised oasis and fulfill our individual quests, be it fortune, glory, or simply escape.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our pathways.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Starseeker* cuts through the inky blackness of interstellar space, hurtling towards Kepler-186f.  Our mission: to establish a habitable outpost on this potentially Earth-like planet.  The vastness of the cosmos is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the subtle hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion to the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and unforeseen cosmic anomalies.  We are pioneers, pushing the boundaries of human exploration, our journey a testament to our unwavering courage and relentless pursuit of the unknown.
