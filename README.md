Her journey from Canterbury to Rome was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new encounter with the vibrant tapestry of medieval life, from bustling market towns to silent, ancient monasteries. The whispered rumors of wonders to be found in the Holy City spurred her onward, a beacon in the face of hardship and uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking display of celestial color.  Navigation between galaxies was a delicate dance with physics and probability, relying on wormhole technology that was still in its relative infancy.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, potentially leading to uncharted planets teeming with life, or to the cold emptiness of space.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kryll crystals, a source of unimaginable power, a treasure worth the risk of traversing the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
