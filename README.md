
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving plains of Iberia, bound for the mythical city of Samarkand.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide through treacherous mountain passes and lawless territories.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unknown, but the lure of the East, whispered in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, fuels her relentless journey.  The whispered promise of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets compels her forward, one perilous step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to possess technology capable of ending the intergalactic war.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva relies on cutting-edge technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and lurking dangers, presents challenges far exceeding those of any medieval journey, yet the allure of discovery and the promise of peace drive her across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
