
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead, the treacherous Black Forest loomed, a tapestry of shadow and whispered legend.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or beastly encounter, a constant reminder of the perils that lay between him and his desperate hope.  The journey was as much a battle against the elements and unknown dangers as it was a race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were everyday occurrences, but the true challenge lay in the vastness of space itself – the isolation, the potential for catastrophic equipment failure, and the ever-present fear of the unknown lurking in the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.  The stars themselves felt like a silent, indifferent audience to her perilous odyssey.
