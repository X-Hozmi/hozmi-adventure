
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the mythical city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of famine gnawed at his resolve.  Yet, the lure of Ys, of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled his steps, each mile a gamble against fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, tested the ship's engines and crew's resilience.  Cosmic storms threatened to shatter their vessel, unknown celestial bodies presented navigational hazards, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space pressed heavily on their souls. But the promise of a new world, a chance to plant the seed of humanity amongst the stars, spurred them onwards, each warp jump a leap of faith into the great unknown.
