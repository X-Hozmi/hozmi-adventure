
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to Canterbury felt endless, a tapestry woven with the grey monotony of rain-soaked fields and the vibrant hues of fleeting glimpses of village life.  Each creak of his saddle, each ache in his bones, was a testament to the miles already conquered, a promise of the adventures – and dangers – yet to come. Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation lurked around every bend in the road, yet the allure of the Canterbury Tales and the pilgrimage itself spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle of shimmering gas clouds and distant galaxies, both humbled and exhilarated her.  The journey, measured not in days but in years, was a test of endurance and technological prowess, punctuated by the thrill of navigating asteroid fields and the quiet camaraderie of her crew.  The reward: the possibility of discovering a new home amongst the stars, a gamble worth taking for the sake of humanity's future.
