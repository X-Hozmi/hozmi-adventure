
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem felt endless, a tapestry woven with treacherous mountain passes, sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers:  swift rivers to ford, crumbling bridges to traverse, and the unsettling silence of vast, empty forests.  His quest – to recover a sacred relic – seemed as distant and elusive as the shimmering horizon itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy. Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  The vast emptiness of space, a canvas painted with breathtaking cosmic wonders, was a constant reminder of her own fragile existence amidst the unimaginable scale of the universe.
