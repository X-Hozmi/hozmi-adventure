
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of hardtack, and a rusty dagger – were all that stood between me and the unknown, as I journeyed to seek my fortune in the distant city of Prague. The journey was arduous, fraught with peril from both nature and man, but the promise of adventure spurred me onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Beyond the viewport, a swirling nebula painted the void in incandescent hues.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth analogue light years from Sol.  This wasn't a quest for gold or glory, but a scientific mission of unimaginable scope, to search for life beyond our solar system.  The risks were different, the dangers less tangible – radiation storms, unforeseen planetary conditions, the vastness of space itself – but the thrill of exploration, the sheer audacity of reaching for the stars, was no less potent than any medieval knight's quest.
