
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s small band pushed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep with each step.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of St. Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought fresh peril – bandit ambushes, the gnawing hunger of the wilderness, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve hardened, their bond strengthened by the shared adventure.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate the mythical lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Warp drives hummed, battling gravitational tides and dodging rogue asteroids, a far cry from the simple trials of a medieval journey.  But the thrill was the same – the unknown beckoned, promising both unimaginable wonders and potentially fatal dangers in equal measure.
