
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a destination whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the crags, and the biting cold threatened to numb her limbs, but the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, both perilous and exhilarating.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the tremor echoing through the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their hyperdrive sputtered, threatening to strand them halfway between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Repairing the ancient engine while dodging rogue asteroids and the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers demanded a skillset honed across decades of interstellar voyages.  The universe was vast, a canvas of shimmering nebulae and uncharted planets, and for Rexx, the greatest adventure wasn't reaching a destination, but the constant dance with survival in its unforgiving expanse.
