
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the sprawling, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled monastery at the heart of the mountains.  Each day brought fresh perils – bandits lurking in shadowed passes, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her. But the whisper of ancient secrets, the promise of finding her lost brother, propelled her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, indifferent sky.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The journey, spanning light years, was punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the occasional solar flare.  But the true dangers lay in the unknown – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the vast, uncharted expanse of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to reshape the future of humanity, burned brighter than any star.
