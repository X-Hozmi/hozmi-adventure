
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing the rumored location of a lost monastery, said to contain ancient secrets. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unknown.  The promise of discovery, however, fueled her weary steps, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of vibrant color as his starship *Stardust* leaped across the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and battling the crippling effects of interdimensional space were mere inconveniences compared to the intoxicating allure of the unknown.  The cosmos, a boundless ocean of stars, held the promise of untold wonders, a stark contrast to the dusty trails of the medieval world.
