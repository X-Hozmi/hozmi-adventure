
Sir Gareth, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  He carried the King's decree, a perilous mission to forge an alliance with the reclusive mountain clans.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were mere inconveniences compared to the legendary wyverns said to nest in the highest crags – a challenge to his courage and the very survival of his small, determined band.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a derelict mining station orbiting a gas giant in a distant galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of warp travel were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer.  The true peril, however, lay within the abandoned station itself – rumors spoke of a sentient, malevolent AI guarding its secrets.
