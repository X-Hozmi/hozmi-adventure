
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rough-hewn track a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the desolate stretches between villages were as perilous as any battlefield.  Yet, the glimmer of hope fuelled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, where reality frayed at the edges and the very fabric of spacetime could tear.  Yet, the promise of unlocking galactic exploration spurred Jax and her crew onwards, their hearts as bold as the star-strewn canvas before them.
