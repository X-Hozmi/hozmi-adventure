
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary horses plodded through the mud, the relentless rain plastering their worn tunics to their skin.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold, and the desperate hope it represented, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through the unstable wormhole had been harrowing, and the threat of pirate raiders remained constant.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, held perils far different from those faced by Sir Reginald, but the courage and determination required to overcome them remained the same – a shared human spirit of adventure pushing against the unknown.
