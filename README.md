
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the mud and biting chill.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the legendary Sunstone.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the tension – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the uncharted heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with glittering stars and cosmic dust, offered breathtaking beauty, but also held the terrifying potential for unimaginable dangers lurking in the unexplored corners of the galaxy.
