
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhineland.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promised a legendary lost city hidden amongst treacherous peaks and shadowed forests.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine – the whispers of bandits, wild beasts, or perhaps worse, the unknown itself.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, masking the ever-present danger of asteroid fields and rogue space pirates.  This wasn't about gold or magic; it was about discovery, about charting the uncharted, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and leaving a mark on the vast, uncaring tapestry of the cosmos. The universe was a canvas, and he, the bold artist.
