
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, already claiming lives in the villages they'd passed.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan steered her starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare isotope from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, vital for the survival of her colony on Proxima Centauri b. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the pirate gangs that plagued the Kepler system demanded sharp reflexes and even sharper wits.  The vastness of space held its own dangers, but the future of her people rested on her ability to overcome them.
