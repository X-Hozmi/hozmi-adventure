
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a snaking line of heavily laden mules and weary travelers, creeps across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the chilling possibility of bandits, disease, or the sheer unforgiving nature of the landscape itself.  Our destination, the legendary city of Samarkand, whispers promises of untold riches and unimaginable dangers – a gamble worth taking for the chance to rewrite our destinies. The creak of wagon wheels and the bray of mules are the soundtrack to our adventure, a symphony of risk and reward played out against the backdrop of a vast, untamed world.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a far cry from the mule's bray.  We hurtle through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy, a tiny speck against the immensity of creation.  Our destination, Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth, holds the promise of a new beginning for humanity.  Yet, the void between the stars is not without its terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena.  Each jump into hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble on the future of our species played out among the silent, awe-inspiring grandeur of the cosmos.
