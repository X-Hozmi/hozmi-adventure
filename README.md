
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant King for aid against the encroaching famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the even more terrifying uncertainty of the unknown lands ahead.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with peril and resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar colonization.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets were child's play compared to the political intrigue and potential alien hostility that awaited him.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a constant reminder of the immense risks and rewards inherent in galactic exploration.
