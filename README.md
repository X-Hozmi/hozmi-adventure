
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she spurred her mare onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the possibility of uncovering lost knowledge, fuelled her onward, each hardship strengthening her resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa guided her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a complex dance with gravity wells and asteroid fields, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the derelict space station orbiting Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown life forms.  The journey was a perilous leap of faith, a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable thirst for exploration that propelled generations beyond their own solar system.
