
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – he was far from home, pursued by bandits across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine, felt increasingly desperate as the sun dipped below the horizon, leaving him alone with the whispering shadows and the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a hypnotic drone against the backdrop of the vast, inky blackness speckled with distant suns.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate patrol were just part of the job.  The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed the risks; Elara was on the cusp of finding something extraordinary, something that could rewrite the history of humanity's place amongst the stars.
