Days stretched before him, filled with the rhythmic crunch of hooves on cobblestones, the whispers of ancient forests, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows. This was the life he craved, a tapestry woven with danger and discovery, where every bend in the road held the promise of something new.

He squinted, the vastness of the starfield pressing down on him, a million points of light scattered across the black canvas of space.

It was a voyage to a newly discovered world, a planet shrouded in mystery, promising both danger and the chance to unravel the secrets of the universe.
