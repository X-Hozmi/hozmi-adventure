
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of illness were constant companions on his arduous journey to the Holy Land.  He clutched the King's missive, its wax seal a fragile promise against the dangers that lay ahead, a testament to the risks inherent in medieval land travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less perilous.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life demanded unwavering vigilance and skill.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, held a stark and terrifying indifference to the fragile human vessel hurtling through its expanse.
