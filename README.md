
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she bumped across the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and horse sweat thick in the air.  Her journey from the windswept highlands to the bustling port city of Marseille felt endless, each day a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the promise of the shimmering Mediterranean and the whispered tales of faraway lands fueled her onward, a fierce determination burning brighter than the midday sun.  She carried a worn map, a family heirloom, and the hope of finding a better life.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets lurking in the dark corners of space. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with peril but offering the tantalizing possibility of discovering new worlds, new resources, and untold wonders beyond human comprehension.
