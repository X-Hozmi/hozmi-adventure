
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of wild animals are constant companions on her journey from the ravaged plains of her homeland to the rumored sanctuary across the Dragon's Tooth Mountains.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge –  fording icy rivers, scaling sheer cliffs, and outwitting the suspicious gaze of villagers wary of strangers.  Her quest is a desperate gamble, a fight for survival and a glimmer of hope in a world steeped in hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course for the unexplored galaxy of Andromeda.  His crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, are on the precipice of discovery, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.  The journey is fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of warp core instability.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of new worlds and ancient secrets, fuels their daring expedition across the vast expanse of space.
