
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary horses plodded through the mud, the stench of decaying vegetation heavy in the air. Their journey to the far-flung kingdom of Eldoria had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and through dense forests where unseen eyes watched their every move.  Each day brought new perils – starvation, illness, and the constant threat of violence – but the lure of Eldoria's fabled Sunstone, and the promise of glory and riches, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the distant galaxy of Andromeda.  Ahead lay the perilous Xylos Rift, a region of unstable space-time where even seasoned navigators feared to tread.  But the potential discovery of a new, habitable planet – a planet teeming with life unlike anything seen before – fueled her unwavering determination. The risks were immense, but the potential reward, a new home for humanity, far outweighed the dangers.
