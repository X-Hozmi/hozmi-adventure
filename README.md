
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to send both beast and rider tumbling, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Yet, the whisper of hope, the yearning for her brother's recovery, spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of its outer reaches painting the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, the unknown dangers of Kepler-186f even greater.  He was facing hostile alien factions, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from the nearest friendly space station.  But the potential reward, the chance to secure peace for countless worlds, overshadowed the risks, pushing him deeper into the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
