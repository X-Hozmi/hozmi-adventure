
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to deliver a vital message to the distant Duke.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of disease are just some of the challenges that stand between her and her destination.  Each sunrise brings a new test of courage and resilience, a constant gamble against the unforgiving elements and the unpredictable nature of the medieval world.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the hyperdrive as the stars streak past Captain Rex’s ship.  Across the vast, inky black of space, the Andromeda Galaxy looms, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling light years away.  His mission: to chart a course through unmapped nebulae, delivering precious samples from a dying star to the Galactic Federation.  Cosmic storms, pirate attacks from the Kryll, and the chilling emptiness of deep space are but a few hazards in Rex's journey. Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown wonders and terrors of the cosmos.
