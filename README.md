
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed onward, towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  My pack, heavy with meager supplies and a gnawing hope, felt like a lead weight on my shoulders.  Each day was a battle against the elements, the treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Yet, the whispered legends of Eldoria's shimmering spires and enchanted forests spurred me on, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of discovery fueled my spirit.


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Ahead, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted the viewport in a breathtaking kaleidoscope of colours, a far cry from the muddy tracks of my medieval ancestor.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity amongst the stars.  This wasn't a journey of survival, but one of exploration, a quest to find a new home amongst the cosmic wonders and unknown dangers of the galaxy.  Though the perils were different - radiation storms, unpredictable wormholes - the thrill of the unknown remained a constant, a powerful current driving us ever forward.
