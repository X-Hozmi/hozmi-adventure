
The sun beat down on the dusty trail, turning the cracked earth into a shimmering mirage.  Sir Gareth spurred his horse forward, the wind whipping his tunic as he rode towards the fabled city of Eldoria.  Tales of its splendor and riches had reached the furthest corners of the kingdom, and he was determined to prove his worth by bringing back a treasure worthy of the king.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle of the wind through the dry grasses, was a whisper of the unknown, a promise of danger and reward.

A wave of nausea washed over the pilot as the ship entered the hyperspace jump.  The stars blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors, then vanished completely as the vessel plunged into the fabric of space itself.  He had dreamt of this moment ever since he was a child, gazing at the distant constellations from his home on Kepler-186f.  Now, he was venturing beyond the known galaxy, towards the whispered legends of the Ancient Ones and the secrets they held in the heart of the Andromeda nebula.  This was his chance to make history, to leave his mark on the cosmos, even if it meant facing the unknown with a trembling heart.
