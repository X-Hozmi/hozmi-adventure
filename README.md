
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones, promising untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  Bandits, wild beasts, and treacherous terrain were but a few of the trials he and his small band of companions faced, their resolve tested with each passing league.  The promise of glory, and perhaps survival, pushed them forward into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a breathtaking distraction from the perilous journey ahead.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal detected only as a faint whisper across the light years.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking gently against the cosmic currents as they navigated asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational anomalies.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held them captive, their courage tested not by bandits and beasts but by the unforgiving emptiness and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
