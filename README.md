
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds against the setting sun.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Days blurred into a relentless cycle of sun-baked journeys, perilous river crossings, and tense nights spent huddled around dwindling fires, wary of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the promise of adventure, but also the grim reality of the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainty that lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy. Her mission: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with life, but shrouded in mystery.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of hyperspace engines, the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the void between stars. The vast distances and unpredictable nature of interstellar travel tested her crew's mettle, their courage and ingenuity constantly challenged by the awe-inspiring and potentially deadly wonders of the cosmos.
