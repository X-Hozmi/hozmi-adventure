
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a chance encounter with a wandering scholar, or the discovery of a forgotten monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  The journey was arduous, the nights cold and lonely, but the lure of the distant, fabled city of Alexandria, whispered to hold a cure for her ailing brother, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only clue.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the unknown, in the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, and perhaps, even a lost piece of humanity’s past amidst the cosmic expanse.
