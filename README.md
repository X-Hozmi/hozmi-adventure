
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of Aquitaine in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandit ambushes or monstrous beasts, making the journey a constant dance between hope and peril.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield, but the weight of his people's fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her cockpit.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, pirate attacks, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and terror, but Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed onward, her gaze fixed on the distant gleam of her destination, a beacon of hope in the infinite darkness.
