
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched Provençal landscape, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales told in taverns.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her spirit as relentlessly as the summer heat.  Yet, with every sunrise, her determination burned brighter, fuelled by faith and the distant promise of the cathedral’s spires.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of swirling cosmic dust and distant suns.  The journey to the Kepler-186f colony was measured not in days, but in weeks of warp travel, punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the eerie silence of deep space.  While free from the immediate perils of brigands, Eva faced a different kind of danger: the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the constant threat of meteor showers, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the possibility of discovering a new life on a habitable planet fueled her courage, making the vast emptiness a thrilling, if daunting, expanse.
