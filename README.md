
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unpredictable whims of nature.  The journey was perilous, a constant test of endurance and wit, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, across treacherous mountain passes and through whispering forests.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets within a newly discovered cluster.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the hum of the hyperdrive a constant reminder of the fragile nature of their vessel against the crushing weight of the cosmos.  Each jump was a gamble, each planet a potential treasure trove of discovery or a deadly trap, pushing the crew to the limits of their technology and courage.
