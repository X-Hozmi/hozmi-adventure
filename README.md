
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest – to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease – drove her onward, through sun-baked plains and shadowed forests, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent beauty of the medieval world.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, kindness from unexpected sources, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, its iridescent hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her ship's controls.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the thrill of pushing humanity's boundaries across the galaxy, fueled her relentless pursuit.
