
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings fresh perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope in his heart, fueled by whispered tales of Eldoria's miraculous healing powers, spurs him onward, a solitary figure against the vast, brutal beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Equipped with cutting-edge technology, she faces dangers far removed from medieval swords and starvation, yet equally perilous: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant gnawing fear of losing her crew to the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  The weight of countless lives rests on her shoulders, a modern echo of Gareth's solitary crusade.
