
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of windswept plains, the chilling damp of shadowed forests, and the bustling chaos of medieval towns.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in the mountains, treacherous river crossings, and the constant gnawing fear of disease. Yet, the allure of Jerusalem, the whispered promises of salvation and glory, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony for humanity.  The journey across galaxies was measured not in days, but in years, a solitary voyage punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the vast, awe-inspiring emptiness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp core breaches, and facing the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation were everyday challenges on a quest to find a new home amongst the stars.
