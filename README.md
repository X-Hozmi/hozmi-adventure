
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel holding all she possessed.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of illness were constant companions on her journey to Santiago de Compostela.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the ever-shifting alliances between warring lords. Yet, the allure of pilgrimage, the whispered promises of miracles and redemption, spurred her onward, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones lining her path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a glittering tapestry of stars and swirling gas, both awed and humbled her.  Navigation challenges, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown celestial anomalies were just some of the perils of interstellar travel. But the promise of discovery, of finding new life and charting unmapped territories, fueled her unwavering ambition and the crew's indomitable spirit.
