
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wheels, each rustle in the sparse brush, holds the promise of bandits, scorching heatstroke, or worse – the whispered legends of djinn and monstrous desert creatures.  Our meager supplies dwindle with every league, our hope fueled by the shimmering mirage of a promised oasis and the whispered tales of Zerzura’s untold riches.

Centuries later, the Althea, a starship the size of a small moon, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint whispers of quasars and the spectral glow of nebulae, Captain Eva Rostova and her crew brave the perils of hyperspace, dodging rogue asteroids and the ever-present threat of void-born creatures.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago. The vastness of space amplifies both their determination and the chilling solitude of their quest.
