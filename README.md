
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, swung rhythmically against her hip. This journey to the rumored monastery in the Pyrenees was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of illness shadowed every mile.  But the whispered tales of a sacred relic, potent enough to heal her ailing brother, fueled her onward.  Each aching muscle, each biting wind, was a step closer to hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the ever-present tension.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, each star a potential hazard or a fleeting landmark in the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims before her, Eva faced dangers not of bandits and disease, but of cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, and potentially hostile, alien life. Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds, propelled her forward.
