
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack, but the desperate hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and potentially hostile lifeforms.  The vastness of space, a canvas of glittering stars and dark, uncharted voids, held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying danger, but Ryla, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, faced the cosmos with unwavering courage, her gaze fixed on the distant glimmer of her destination.
