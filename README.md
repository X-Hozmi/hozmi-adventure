
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the biting wind whipping her cloak around her.  Ahead lay the vast, unknown expanse of the Ardennes forest, rumored to be haunted by wild beasts and brigands, but also said to hold the lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones for its rumored untold riches.  With only her loyal dog, a well-worn map, and a heart full of courage, Elara embarked on her perilous journey, each creak of her saddle leather a counterpoint to the symphony of rustling leaves and distant bird calls.  Survival depended not only on her wits but also on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers encountered along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Ronson piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold resources and the potential for a new human colony.  But the journey across the galaxy wasn't without peril.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadows, space-quakes threatened to shatter the ship, and the vast emptiness of space pressed down, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the cosmic grandeur. The vast unknown stretched before him, a shimmering tapestry of stars and dangers, promising both unimaginable wealth and the very real possibility of a fiery, premature end.
