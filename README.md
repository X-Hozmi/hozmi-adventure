
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes lurked in every shadowed forest, and the whispers of plague stalked the weary travelers along the road.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – negotiating treacherous mountain passes, fording raging rivers, and bartering for meager provisions in squalid villages.  The road was long, the dangers real, but the promise of Jerusalem fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigation charts were unreliable, alien storms raged with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids kept her crew on edge.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each planetary scan a suspenseful moment of truth. Yet, driven by a thirst for discovery and the hope of finding humanity's future, Eva pressed onward, charting a course through the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
