
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenean landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each creak of her saddle and rise of the terrain, a sense of exhilaration swelled within her, fuelled by the ancient stories whispered around campfires and the promise of spiritual renewal at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with shimmering starlight and the ominous shadows of black holes, instilled both awe and a healthy dose of fear.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of solar flares demanded unwavering focus and nerves of steel.  But the lure of discovering new life, of charting unmapped territories in the cosmic ocean, propelled Eva and her crew onward, towards the unknown frontiers of a galaxy teeming with possibilities.
