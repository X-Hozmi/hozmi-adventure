
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, her determination burned brighter, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination before it was too late.  The journey was arduous, but the whispers of Ys, a promise of healing and perhaps even magic, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint but persistent, promising a rediscovery of ancient knowledge.  Warp jumps tossed her crew between realities, the ship buffeted by gravitational tides and cosmic storms. Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. But the allure of the lost colony, the promise of untold discoveries,  outweighed the risks, driving Ryla and her crew ever deeper into the vast, breathtaking expanse of space.
