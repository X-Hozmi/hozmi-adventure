
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's retinue crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before them.  Their journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of untold riches and the Sultan's promise of an alliance against the encroaching Mongol hordes spurred them onward, each weary step a testament to their unwavering courage and the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable nature of warp drives were all in a day's work for this intrepid crew, their adventure a testament to humanity's boundless thirst for exploration beyond the confines of their own solar system.
