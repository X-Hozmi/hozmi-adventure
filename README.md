The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy brown curtain obscuring the already-distant spires of Oakhaven.  Ahead lay the Whispering Woods, legendary home to outlaws and worse, a perilous journey undertaken to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria and its fabled healing spring, a desperate gamble to save his ailing sister.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lurked in every shadow.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla adjusted her bio-visor, the swirling nebula of Xylos filling the viewport.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, throwing the crew of the *Stardust Wanderer* against their restraints. Now, their mission - to retrieve a vital enzyme from the Xylossian fungal forests, the only known cure for the Kryll plague ravaging the Federation –  lay before them.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion; a single malfunction could mean the difference between a successful mission and the cold, unforgiving void of interstellar space.
