
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, encounters with bandits, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the unwavering hope fueled his journey, pushing him further into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylan crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space presented perils far different from Kaelan's – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But like Kaelan, Elara pressed on, driven by a burning curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of the known universe, leaving a trail of stardust in her wake.
