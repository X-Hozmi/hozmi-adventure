
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each rocky pass presented a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadows, treacherous terrain demanding her full attention, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the secret to immortality, spurred her onward. The rhythmic clop of hooves was a counterpoint to the gnawing hunger and the growing sense of adventure that swelled in her chest, a thrill eclipsing the very real dangers.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's vibrant hues.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, simultaneously awed and terrified her.  Each jump through hyperspace held a whisper of the unknown – the potential for discovery, but also for catastrophic failure.  The gamble was enormous, but the promise of finding a new home, a new beginning, made the risk worthwhile.
