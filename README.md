
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she rides, the rhythmic clop of her horse's hooves a counterpoint to the wind whistling through the desolate plains.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, her resolve hardens, fueled by the hope of returning home a savior.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the vast emptiness between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Cluster, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate incursions, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation are all in a day's work.  The loneliness of space is a constant companion, yet the promise of discovery and the thrill of charting unmapped territories drives her onward, a lone explorer pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
