
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the creeping despair of their dwindling supplies.  The journey was a brutal tapestry woven from hardship and hope, a testament to the enduring human spirit against the unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its shimmering colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the ship's navigation systems.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in standard time but a mere few weeks thanks to the wonders of faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos, vast and unpredictable, presented its own dangers – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the allure of exploration, the thrill of pushing humanity's boundaries, far outweighed the risks for this intrepid crew.
