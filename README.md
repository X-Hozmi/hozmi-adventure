
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the very elements themselves.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering hope of finding salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly colonized planet of Aethel, a world teeming with strange flora and fauna, and possibly, unseen dangers.  Warp jumps across light-years were commonplace, but the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every voyage a perilous adventure.  The galaxy itself was their uncharted frontier.
