
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Andalusia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained the seed of a new life, a sapling entrusted to her by a dying scholar, a sapling said to hold the cure for the plague sweeping the land.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the promise of danger – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease – yet the hope within the satchel fueled her onward, a tiny green flame against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies.  But the vastness of space held its own perils; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders all loomed large.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries to the edge of the known universe, propelled her forward, a tiny ship against the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
