
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary horses plodded through the mud, the stench of rain-soaked earth and decaying vegetation heavy in the air.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land was proving far more arduous than the tales of chivalry had prepared them for.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in a minstrel's song.  Each day brought new challenges, testing their courage and resilience as they pushed ever closer to their sacred destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. Her mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Ahead lay light years of unpredictable gravitational fields, potential pirate encounters, and the daunting possibility of encountering alien life – both benevolent and hostile.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, offered little comfort against the loneliness and dangers of her solitary quest.
