
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their meager supplies dwindling with each league. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city, whispered to lie beyond the Serpent Mountains, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their courage and loyalty.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new chance for glory, or a grim end to their adventure.  The hope of unimaginable riches and the legends of the Sunstone fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanium crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations for slower vessels.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the constant threat of warp core malfunctions demanded every ounce of her skill and the unwavering dedication of her crew.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered no easy passage, but the promise of intergalactic trade and the thrill of exploration kept them soaring through the cosmos.
