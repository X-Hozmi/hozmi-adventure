
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a dense forest, promising both peril and untold riches.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and whispered legends of mythical beasts added to the ever-present sense of danger. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient knowledge, spurred him on. Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrilling uncertainty of his medieval quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking emptiness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, alien energy signatures were commonplace hazards, but the potential discovery of new life, new technologies, outweighed the risk.  The endless expanse of the cosmos beckoned, promising adventure on a scale unimaginable to medieval travelers.
