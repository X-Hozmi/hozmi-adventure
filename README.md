
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crested the hill.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched fields and ominous, shadow-laden forests.  Their journey to the rumored lost city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the woods, disease stalked the villages, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their heels.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled their trek, a burning desire to uncover the secrets whispered on the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been treacherous, a harrowing test of both ship and crew.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with the cosmic dust of a million dying stars, both awed and terrified her.  But the knowledge that the fate of billions rested on her shoulders was a stronger force than fear, propelling her onwards into the uncharted abyss.
