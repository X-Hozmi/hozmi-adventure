
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista of jagged peaks and snow-covered valleys, a stark beauty offset by the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in my belly. My quest – to reach the fabled city of K'tharr, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists – drove me onward, the promise of discovery eclipsing the hardships of the journey. Every creak of my pack, every howl of the wind, was a reminder of the wild, untamed nature of this medieval world.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a far cry from the Alpine winds.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we jumped between galaxies, the vastness of space a humbling contrast to the limited horizons of the medieval era.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The risks were different now – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown sentient life – but the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push beyond the known, remained the same potent driving force.
