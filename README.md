
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, drive her westward, a perilous journey through bandit-infested passes and unforgiving wilderness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightens the adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers and breathtaking beauty that lie ahead in this untamed land.  Companionship is a fleeting luxury; her courage and cunning are her only true allies.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of cosmic gas and dying stars.  His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light years away, teeming with alien life both wondrous and deadly.  Faster-than-light travel is routine, yet the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, the looming threat of pirate raiders, and the sheer vastness of the galaxy make each voyage a thrilling gamble.  The stars are his canvas, and his destiny a constellation yet to be charted.
