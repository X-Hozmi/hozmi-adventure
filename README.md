
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested his resolve, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Every crackling fire at night, shared with fellow travelers as wary as he, offered fleeting respite before the next leg of his perilous journey across the vast and unknown stretches of land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a desperate humanity, scattered across the dying embers of Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels from the Kryll Confederacy, and repairing warp drives under the glare of distant suns were all in a day’s work.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the cold light of distant stars and the hum of her ship's engines, was a constant reminder of the colossal distance – and the enormous risks – separating her from her destination, a gamble for the survival of her species.
