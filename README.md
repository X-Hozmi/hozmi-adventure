
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister’s wasting sickness.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast distance still to travel, fueled only by his unwavering devotion and a dwindling supply of hardtack.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant K'tharr system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with risks far exceeding any medieval knight's.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms were all part of a routine that kept her adrenaline pumping.  But the potential reward – salvation for a dying colony – spurred her onward, across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
