
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of mythical beasts echoed through the canyons.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zamora, said to hold the key to healing her ailing brother.  The journey itself, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, was an adventure more thrilling than any tale spun in a tavern.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and distorted but promising salvation for a dying world.  Asteroids, the silent threat of gravitational wells, and the ever-present danger of pirate vessels were merely obstacles in a voyage across the cosmos, a journey as grand and potentially deadly as any medieval pilgrimage.  The vastness of space, its untold mysteries, offered an adventure that dwarfed even the wildest dreams of knights and explorers of old.
