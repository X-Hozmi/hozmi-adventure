
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, spurred him onward, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of space remained a formidable opponent.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing vital systems after encounters with unforeseen cosmic phenomena were all in a day's work.  Yet, the sheer breathtaking scale of the universe, the endless possibilities awaiting discovery, fuelled her determination, making every jump to hyperspace a thrilling leap into the unknown.
