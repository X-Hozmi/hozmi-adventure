
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she rode her weary mare across the sun-baked plains of France.  Ahead lay the Pyrenees, a formidable barrier separating her from the rumored sanctuary of the Knights Templar in Spain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse grasses, held the potential for danger – bandits, starvation, disease – yet the allure of freedom and the whispered promise of a hidden city fueled her onward.  She clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, its cryptic symbols her only guide.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the perils of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  But the possibility of discovering a new world, of charting unknown galaxies and encountering alien life, outweighed the risks.  The vast expanse of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, mirrored the boundless courage within Eva's heart.
