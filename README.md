
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from months of relentless travel across the unforgiving landscape.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and untold riches, spurred him on, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that clawed at his belly. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, but they were finally nearing Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The galaxy held countless wonders and terrors, and Eva, a seasoned explorer, knew the risks.  Pirate attacks, hostile alien lifeforms, and the unpredictable nature of space itself were constant threats, yet the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge,  made the dangers worthwhile.
