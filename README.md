
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, bumped against her hip, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient texts of untold power, spurred her onward, despite the lurking bandits and treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of the mule's harness, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both danger and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Years of charting treacherous wormholes and evading the relentless Kryll pirates had prepared him for the challenges ahead.  The vast, star-dusted canvas outside his viewport offered breathtaking beauty, but the unknown dangers of Xylos, and the potential rewards, fuelled the relentless drive of his expedition.
