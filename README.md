
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's small band of travellers pushed their weary horses onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate plains.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in every shadowed wood, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a test of endurance and faith, a gamble against the unpredictable whims of fate and the harshness of the medieval world.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage across light years and potentially hostile alien territories.  Advanced technology offered a shield against some dangers, but the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of the cosmos still presented a constant, thrilling challenge – a modern-day quest for the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human exploration to the very edge of the universe.
