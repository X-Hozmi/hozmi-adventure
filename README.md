
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Anatolia, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestries and promised riches of the distant Silk Road.  His small band of mercenaries, weary from weeks of relentless travel, pressed on, spurred by whispers of a lost city teeming with ancient artifacts and untold wealth.  Each creak of their saddles, each clang of their armor, echoed the perilous journey ahead, a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, greed, and the ever-present threat of bandits and disease.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a technologically advanced, long-lost civilization.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was commonplace; the vastness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness than any desert could offer.  The weight of her mission, the fate of countless lives hanging in the balance, was a heavier burden than any pack mule could carry, a constant companion in the silent expanse between the stars.
