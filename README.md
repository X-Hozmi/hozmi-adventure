
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest, shadows lengthening as dusk approached.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold treasures beyond imagining, but also guarded by perils both natural and supernatural – wolves, bandits, and something far more ancient stirring in the dark heart of the woods.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a jewel of a planet orbiting a red dwarf star, potentially harboring life.  The journey, measured in light-years and punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive, was a lonely one, but Eva felt a kinship with the intrepid explorers of old.  She, too, was charting the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, facing the unknown with a courage fueled by the endless expanse of the cosmos.
