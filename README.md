
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aerthos.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a stark reminder of the perilous beauty and unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp jumps across unimaginable distances, navigating asteroid fields the size of small moons, and the constant threat of pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony were just some of the challenges facing Eva and her crew. The cosmos, vast and awe-inspiring, held both unparalleled wonder and unimaginable danger in equal measure.
