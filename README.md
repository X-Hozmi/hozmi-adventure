
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey to the Holy Land was proving far more arduous than the tales of crusaders had described.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliffs, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Yet, with every league covered, the thrill of the unknown spurred him on, the promise of adventure outweighing the hardships of the road.  He carried with him not only his meager possessions, but a burning hope to witness lands beyond his wildest dreams.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Captain Eva Rostova's ears as she navigated the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar unity.  Unlike Thomas's perilous land journey, Eva's voyage was fraught with the dangers of unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failures in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  Yet, the vastness of the cosmos and the allure of discovery fueled her unwavering determination, pushing the boundaries of human exploration and forging a path for a future where the stars themselves were no longer a distant dream, but a destination within reach.
