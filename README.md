
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the scent of woodsmoke and wild thyme clinging to the air.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from bandits lurking in the shadows to the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the glory awaiting him, spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling solar flares were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyage.  But the greatest dangers came not from the cosmos, but from the unknown – sentient space anomalies and rival corporations vying for control of the new world.  The riches and scientific discoveries awaiting her on Kepler-186f, however, were worth the unimaginable risks.
