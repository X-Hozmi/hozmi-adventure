
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald’s warhorse as he rides, the midday sun beating down on his worn leather armor.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  The journey is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test his strength and resolve, and the whispers of mythical beasts keep him ever vigilant. Each sunrise brings new challenges, pushing him further into the unknown, his hope fueled by the whispers of Eldoria's healing power.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Warp jumps carry her across unimaginable distances, each one a gamble against unpredictable space anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by breathtaking celestial wonders and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, makes every moment a test of skill and courage, as she pushes towards a future that may or may not exist.
