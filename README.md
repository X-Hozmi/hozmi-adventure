
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in fiery hues.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, promised a legendary city of gold hidden beyond the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions, but the lure of untold riches, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled her relentless journey across the vast, untamed lands. Each sunrise brought new challenges and the chilling possibility of failure, yet the spirit of adventure burned bright within her.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of distant stars.  But the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped galaxies, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration drove Nova and her crew forward, their hearts filled with the same audacious spirit of adventure that had propelled countless explorers before them.
