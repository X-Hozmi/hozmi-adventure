
The year is 1348.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled her onward, through sun-drenched valleys and treacherous mountain passes, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and deadly dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, yet the journey was far from effortless.  Navigation through asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions tested her skills and courage to their limits, a perilous dance across the cosmic ocean.
