
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging Kaelan’s homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, each hardship forging a stronger bond between the weary travelers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva. The vastness of the cosmos both intimidated and exhilarated her, the thrill of discovery a potent antidote to the loneliness of interstellar travel.  The fate of countless worlds rested on her shoulders, and the journey ahead was fraught with peril, yet Eva pressed on, guided by her unwavering resolve and the hope of finding a lost civilization.
