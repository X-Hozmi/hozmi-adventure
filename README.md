
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of hope in Eldoria’s promise spurred him on, each sunrise a new challenge, each nightfall a precarious respite in the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue solar flares was routine, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes that punctuated interstellar travel.  A single miscalculation could mean being flung across galaxies, lost to the vast emptiness forever.  The vastness of space presented a different kind of hardship than the medieval traveler faced, yet the courage and determination to overcome impossible odds remained the same.
