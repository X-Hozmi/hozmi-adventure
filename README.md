
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far less daunting than the unknown which lay ahead – the legendary city of Ys, rumored to be hidden somewhere in the Breton marshes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, sent shivers of anticipation and dread down her spine, fueling her relentless journey toward the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of distant suns was routine, but the thrill of exploration never waned.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, while breathtakingly beautiful, held the same dangerous allure as the medieval wilderness – a promise of discovery, and the ever-present risk of encountering something utterly unknown.
