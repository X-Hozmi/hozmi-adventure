
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a victory against the relentless downpour.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass, my meager belongings strapped to my weary mule.  Ahead lay the fabled city of  Serinor, rumored to hold both unimaginable riches and deadly peril. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were my constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown spurred me onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby as my starship cleaved through the inky blackness of space.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, but the promise of new worlds, new civilizations, and alien wonders far outweighed the risks.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The vast emptiness of space felt less isolating than the loneliness of the medieval road, but the thrill of discovery burned just as brightly, a timeless human quest for something more.
