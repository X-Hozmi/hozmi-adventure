
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers snaked across his path, and the whispers of mythical creatures kept his hand constantly on the hilt of his sword. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve.  The journey was arduous, but the hope of healing fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, scattered across a cluster of habitable planets.  Navigating through asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and repairing warp drives became commonplace. The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty in nebulae of vibrant colours and terrifying encounters with unknown celestial phenomena.  Unlike Sir Kaelan, Eva relied on technology, but the courage and determination required for exploration remained timeless, echoing across the centuries and the cosmos.
