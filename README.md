
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beneath the churning waves.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were his constant companions, each day a gamble against exhaustion and the lurking shadows of the unknown.  The whispered tales of Ys fueled his determination, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant thrum against the vast, silent emptiness of space, punctuated only by the crackle of comms and the occasional alert from the navigation system.  Alien landscapes, uncharted systems, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a perilous dance between ambition and survival.  The promise of new life and discovery, however, outweighed the risks, pushing her further into the cosmic unknown.
