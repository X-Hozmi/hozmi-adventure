
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead stretches the unforgiving expanse of the Black Forest, rumored to house brigands and worse.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hurried scribbles, promises a hidden monastery holding the cure for her brother's illness, a journey fraught with peril but fuelled by desperate hope. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sends a shiver down her spine, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel and the courage it demands.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan pilots his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The vast emptiness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, the shimmering constellations a stark contrast to the primitive landscapes of old.  His journey is not about physical hardship, but mental fortitude – the constant vigilance against asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the gnawing isolation of deep space exploration.  The universe, despite its technological marvels, holds its own brand of perilous adventure.
