
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and whispered legends, guides her towards the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the chilling whispers of the forest itself.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover Ys's secrets, fuels her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast, encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Wanderer,' its sleek hull reflecting the nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Cygnus Arm, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel masks the vastness of space, yet the dangers remain – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of the Kryll, a sentient space-faring species whose motives remain inscrutable.  Every jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking and terrifying unknown.
