
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the western sea.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, already claiming lives in nearby villages.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate hope balanced against the ever-present threat of hardship and death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan piloted her starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The jump through hyperspace had been brutal, but the potential rewards were limitless – rare minerals, alien flora and fauna unlike anything catalogued before.  Yet the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone explorers venturing so far from established trade routes.  Survival demanded not just skill, but a daring spirit willing to push the boundaries of the known universe.
