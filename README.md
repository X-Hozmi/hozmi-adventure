
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the peril of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of losing her way in the trackless expanse.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the promise of salvation, spurred her onward, a tiny spark against the vast indifference of the landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien lifeforms.  But the thrill of discovery, the yearning to push the boundaries of human exploration, burned as brightly in his heart as the starlight that painted his cockpit.
