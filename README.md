
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  But the whispers of Eldoria, a city shimmering with hope, spurred them onwards, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all part of a galactic trader’s life.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the ever-present challenge fueled her spirit – a modern adventurer traversing the cosmos in search of a different kind of reward.
