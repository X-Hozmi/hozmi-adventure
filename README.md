
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees mountains, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new vista: sun-drenched vineyards giving way to rugged, unforgiving terrain, the air thick with the scent of pine and fear.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, relied on each other for survival, facing down sudden storms, navigating treacherous rivers, and constantly wary of the lurking dangers of the wild.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The Althea, a starship forged of dreams and advanced alloys, leaps across the vast gulf separating us from Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a lullaby, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling outside our viewport.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored ecosystems of this potentially habitable exoplanet.  But the galaxy is a dangerous place.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravity wells, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters make every jump a gamble.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of something new, fuels our relentless journey into the unknown.
