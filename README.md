
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the setting sun painting the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered prophecies and a desperate hope for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the unwavering faith in her heart spurred her onward, a beacon in the deepening twilight.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been rough, the ship shuddering under the strain of traversing the unpredictable wormhole.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving Earth from a looming ecological collapse.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, dwarfed even her courageous spirit, but the weight of her planet's fate rested on her shoulders, a greater burden than any cosmic storm.
