
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat and a chipped map promising a legendary lost city nestled amidst treacherous mountains. Bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the capricious whims of nature all tested her spirit. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new risk, but with every aching muscle and near-miss, her resolve hardened, fueled by the allure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport were breathtaking, but the true adventure lay in the uncharted systems beyond. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, with the possibility of discovering new life, encountering hostile alien civilizations, or worse, never finding her way back home.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a boundless frontier begging to be explored.
