The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the rutted track as he traversed the untamed wilds, his small band of companions a silhouette against the fiery horizon.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, propelled them forward, despite the looming threat of brigands and the ever-present danger of the unforgiving terrain.
