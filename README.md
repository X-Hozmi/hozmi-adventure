
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his mule onward. The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape of southern France.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister, had taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the heart of a simmering peasant revolt.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset a gnawing uncertainty, yet the flickering hope of salvation fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a perilous journey fraught with the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue asteroids and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vast emptiness of space held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying loneliness. The hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms were the only constants in a universe brimming with endless possibilities and unimaginable dangers.
