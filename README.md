
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the chilling whispers of the Black Death already snaking across Europe. Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide through treacherous mountain passes and untamed wilderness, a testament to the courage and foolhardiness it took to chase a rumour, a legend, across a continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant colony on the edge of explored space.  Navigation relied not on ancient maps but on complex astrogation charts and the unwavering hum of the hyperdrive.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating in the lawless sectors beyond the Galactic Federation's reach. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the yearning for the unknown, remained a constant, a primal urge that pushed humanity across the vastness of the cosmos, just as it had once driven Elara across the medieval world.
