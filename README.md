Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of potential ambush – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Survival wasn't guaranteed, but the hope for her brother's life fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

The odds were stacked against him, but the potential reward – a fortune and a chance to finally return home – was a gamble Rexx was willing to make.  The fate of his crew, and the future of their fledgling colony, rested on this perilous jump.
