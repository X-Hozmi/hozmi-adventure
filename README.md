
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the bruised autumn sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail was treacherous, a ribbon of mud winding through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown.  He carried a king's ransom and a king's decree:  to reach the distant court of Avignon before winter's grip closed, a journey fraught with brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The spirit of adventure, however, burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered across the holographic display, charting a course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, both terrified and exhilarated her. Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and the unquenchable thirst for exploration beyond the confines of a single world.
