
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and meager supplies.  Each sunrise brought the risk of bandits, scorching heat, and treacherous terrain, but the promise of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, nestled deep within the forbidden mountains, fueled her onward.  She navigated by the stars, relying on whispered legends and the kindness of weary travelers, her journey a testament to human resilience and the enduring allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy.  Her ship, a marvel of futuristic engineering, leaped between wormholes, defying the vast distances between star systems. The mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying home planet.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of vibrant colors and celestial wonders, was both awe-inspiring and treacherous, a constant test of skill, courage, and unwavering determination.
