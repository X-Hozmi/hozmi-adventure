
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her lost brother, rumored to be with a band of mercenaries far to the east.  Each creaking step was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements, but the whisper of adventure, fueled by a sister's love, spurred her onward across the unforgiving landscapes of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a desperate attempt to reach the mythical planet of Aethel, said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  With her loyal crew battling malfunctions and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Jax relied on her instincts and advanced technology to conquer the unimaginable distances between worlds, fueled by a desire to prevent galactic conflict.
