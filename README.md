The dusty track wound through a sun-baked landscape, the distant peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a jagged promise of peril and untold riches.  His quest: to retrieve the lost Scepter of Aethelred from the clutches of the goblin king, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, a constant dance between courage and survival.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

Unlike the medieval adventurer, Eva possessed advanced technology, but the vastness of space held its own mysteries, its own unpredictable currents that tested her navigational skills and courage to the absolute limit.
