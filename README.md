
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the ridge, the sprawling, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind in the tall grasses, hinted at the dangers that lay ahead: bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature itself.  Survival depended on her wits, her courage, and the kindness of strangers – a perilous journey fuelled by desperate hope.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new colony for humanity.  The journey across the galaxy was a blur of warp speed and calculated risks, the ship's AI a constant companion battling cosmic radiation and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  But the true adventure lay not in the technology, but in the vast unknown, the potential for discovery, and the unshakeable human spirit pushing against the seemingly infinite expanse of space, seeking a new home among the stars.
