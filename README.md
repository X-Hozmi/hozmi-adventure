
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold secrets older than the Kingdom itself.  His knapsack, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, felt like a lead weight, but the promise of adventure – of uncovering forgotten lore and perhaps even untold riches – spurred him on through the darkening forest, the distant howls of wolves a thrilling counterpoint to the clatter of his horse's hooves.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its shimmering colours a breathtaking backdrop to their mission.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by countless factions across the galaxy.  The thrill of the unknown, the potential for discovery, and the ever-present danger of pirate fleets and unpredictable wormholes made each jump through hyperspace a gamble – a thrilling, breathtaking gamble worth taking.
