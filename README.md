
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant sultan.  Each creak of the saddle, each scorching sunbeam, was a testament to the perilous journey. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend, testing her resilience and faith.  Yet, the promise of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of warp storms and hostile alien encounters.  Advanced technology eased some burdens, but the vastness of space instilled a profound solitude, a different kind of loneliness than the medieval traveler ever knew.  The weight of responsibility for her crew, and the hope of finding survivors, burned brighter than any sun.
