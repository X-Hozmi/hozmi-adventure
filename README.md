Before her lay the sprawling, sun-baked plains of Andalusia, a shimmering heat haze obscuring the distant city of Cordoba, her destination.  Days of relentless travel had hardened her hands, but the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of Moorish scholars and bustling markets, fueled her onward.

The mission: to locate a rumored precursor civilization and secure their advanced technology.  The dangers were plentiful, from hostile alien life to the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, but the allure of discovery, of charting the uncharted, burned brighter than any star in the vast, inky blackness.
