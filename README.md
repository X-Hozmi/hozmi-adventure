
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she guides her weary mule across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a daunting but necessary obstacle on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, yet the whisper of ancient magic and untold riches fuels her onward, a flicker of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later,  Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Instead of bandits, he faces asteroid fields and rogue space pirates; instead of disease, the crushing loneliness of interstellar space. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, propels him through hyperspace jumps and perilous encounters.  The cosmos is a vast and terrifying canvas, but Jax, like Elara before him, is driven by an unyielding spirit of adventure.
