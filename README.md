
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel holds little more than a chipped map, a handful of dried dates, and the unwavering hope of finding her brother, lost in the treacherous mountains beyond the Whispering Woods.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each fleeting glimpse of a distant castle, represents a chance encounter, a potential clue, or perhaps, a deadly threat in this unforgiving land.  She travels not for riches, but for family, her heart a compass leading her through perilous passes and haunted forests.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, is fraught with the unknown.  Hyperspace jumps are unpredictable, alien encounters are a constant threat, and the weight of the mission – the survival of her crew and the future of colonization – rests heavily on her shoulders. Yet, the vast, glittering expanse of space holds a powerful allure, a siren's call to explore the mysteries beyond the known universe.
