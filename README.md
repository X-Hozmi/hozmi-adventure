
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest, to reach the legendary monastery of St. Fiacre and retrieve the lost scroll of healing, was proving far more arduous than the chronicles foretold.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of a long journey tested his resolve at every turn.  Yet, the glint of the distant spire, barely visible through the hazy twilight, spurred him onward, a beacon in the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship 'Hope's End' lost somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravity wells of uncharted planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and alien encounters that threatened to derail her mission. Each jump through hyperspace brought a new challenge, a new star system holding both promise and peril.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the colossal undertaking she’d embarked upon.
