
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, spurred her onward, a lone woman against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the navigation console.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the twinkling of distant galaxies, held a different kind of danger—the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, the ever-present threat of pirate vessels, and the isolation that gnawed at the soul even in the company of a loyal crew.
