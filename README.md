
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, pick their way across the parched Breton countryside.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril: bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of their endurance, each sunset a testament to their resilience.  The path is uncertain, the destination a glimmer of hope amidst a landscape both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of space remains a daunting, unpredictable frontier.  Cosmic storms threaten to tear her ship apart, while the possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien life forms hangs over every jump to hyperspace.  The journey is a race against time, a testament to human ingenuity and courage in the face of the ultimate unknown.
