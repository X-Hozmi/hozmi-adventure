
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by unwavering loyalty, spurred her onward, pushing her past the limits of her endurance.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward far outweighed the risk.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starfall" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Kryll warships, Rexx relied on his wits and advanced technology to survive.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, yet held a chilling emptiness that constantly reminded him of his isolation and the fragility of life amongst the stars.
