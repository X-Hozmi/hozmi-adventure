
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map – its edges frayed from countless unfoldings and refoldings.  Ahead lay the rumored hidden monastery of Saint Fiacre, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones, a journey fraught with brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the whispered promise of ancient wisdom and untold riches spurred her onward, her heart a wild drum against her ribs.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a rhythmic pulse against the infinite darkness punctuated by the distant, swirling nebulae.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were astronomical - hostile alien species, treacherous wormholes, and the ever-present threat of navigational error in the uncharted reaches of space. But the potential reward – a revolution in interstellar travel – made the gamble worthwhile.
