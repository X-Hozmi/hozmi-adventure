
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward. The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Black Forest.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled his apprehension, yet the promise of salvation spurred him onward through treacherous passes and shadowed valleys, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  The jump to the Gliese 581g system had been a risky one, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits. Her mission: to establish contact with a newly discovered sentient species.  Cosmic radiation crackled around her vessel, a constant reminder of the immense distances and the perils of interstellar travel, but the potential for galactic diplomacy and understanding far outweighed the hazards of the unknown.
