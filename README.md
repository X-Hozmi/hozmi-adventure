
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary horse as he traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the distant monastery of Saint-Michel-de-la-Coudre, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed heart of the whispering forest.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease – but the unwavering hope of his mission spurred him onward.  He carried not only a relic, but the hopes of an entire kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the peril of unmapped wormholes, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  Advanced technology offered a measure of safety, but the vast emptiness of space, and the unknown dangers lurking within, still held a primal fear.  The fate of countless colonies rested on the success of her daring expedition, a voyage pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
