
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he crests the hill, the sun glinting off his battered chainmail.  Before him stretches the unforgiving expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry woven with treacherous bogs, dense forests rumored to house brigands, and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees mountains.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint-Michel, seeking a cure for his ailing brother.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, speaks of the unknown dangers that lie ahead, testing his courage and resilience on a journey that could cost him everything.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes pilots the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, rumored to hold the key to solving the galactic famine.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and contending with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace are all in a day's work for Elara and her crew.  The vastness of space holds both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, each jump to warp speed a gamble against the crushing weight of interstellar distance and the ever-present threat of the void.
