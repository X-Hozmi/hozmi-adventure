
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a few coins, and a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold a legendary healing balm.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the lure of the balm – a hope for her ailing brother – fueled her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rocky path, was a step closer to her desperate quest.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos system, the vast expanse of space a stark contrast to Elara's earthly journey. His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hummed with the energy of a thousand suns as it leaped between galaxies, each jump a calculated risk.  Unlike Elara’s tangible threats, Rexx faced the unseen dangers of cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien civilizations. Yet, the promise of discovering a new, habitable planet – a new home for a dying Earth – drove him and his crew across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
