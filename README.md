
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the grueling journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from Prague to Constantinople.  My meager supplies dwindled, my companions’ spirits flagging, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred us onward, braving blizzards and bandits alike.  Every creak of the wind, every rustle in the snow, held the promise of discovery – or death.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet veiled in mystery at the edge of known space.  Unlike the medieval trails, navigation was precise, guided by celestial charts and AI. Yet, the thrill was no less potent. The cosmic ocean surrounding us held its own dangers, from rogue asteroids to unpredictable wormholes.  The journey was a lonely one, punctuated by the cold reality of interstellar distances, but the potential for unlocking Xylos' secrets, for expanding human knowledge to unimaginable frontiers, fueled my solitary voyage.
