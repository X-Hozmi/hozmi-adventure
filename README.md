
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each rocky outcrop held the promise of bandits or worse – the whispers of a mythical beast, said to guard a lost monastery, fueled her journey.  Days blurred into a relentless cycle of sun-baked trails, meager meals, and the constant companionship of fear and hope.  The monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets, was a siren's call, beckoning her despite the ever-present danger lurking in the shadows of the mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against the unforgiving void of space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against malfunctioning engines and the ever-present threat of pirates.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, offered a different kind of peril, a cold, silent danger far removed from the human threats of Elara's time, yet just as deadly.
