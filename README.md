
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over sun-baked plains. Each day brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, the constant threat of wild animals, and the ever-present fear of encountering hostile factions. Yet, the whisper of Ys, a city said to hold unimaginable wonders, propelled her forward, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The journey was a breathtaking ballet of gravitational pulls and hyperspace jumps, each star a distant sun, each planet a gamble.  While the dangers were far removed from bandits and wild animals – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the isolation and the vastness of space were a different kind of terrifying.  Yet, the hope of finding a new home fueled her and her crew, driving them across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
