
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a crumpled map – her lifeline to the fabled city of Eldoria. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey, testing her courage and resilience.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-earned victory, forging her into a woman as tough as the unforgiving land itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating nebulae, dodging asteroid fields, and outmaneuvering pirate vessels were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer.  Her quest: to find the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The endless darkness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, was a constant reminder of both the danger and the awe-inspiring grandeur of her intergalactic voyage.
