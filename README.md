
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and dark forests whispering tales of bandits and magical creatures.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than herself, promising riches and adventure in the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of the unknown, a thrilling blend of fear and exhilaration that fueled her journey across a land teeming with both peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the Xylos Nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the incandescent beauty of a thousand exploding suns.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the galaxy, seeking new trade routes and habitable planets.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering gas clouds and swirling galaxies, was both breathtaking and daunting.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the allure of discovery, the chance to find new life, new worlds, propelled her onwards, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the cosmic ocean.
