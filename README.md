Her journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous terrain tested her resilience, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, the whispers of a mythical city, rumored to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches, fueled her relentless progress, each sunrise a promise of closer proximity to her elusive goal.

But Ryla, ever driven by hope for a brighter future, pressed on, the vastness of the galaxy both terrifying and exhilaratingly inspiring.
