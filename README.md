
The year is 1348.  A chill wind bites at Elara's face as she guides her weary horse across the desolate plains.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Ys, a city of shimmering spires beneath the waves, fuel her unwavering resolve, pushing her ever onward through the harsh realities of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius navigates his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the far-flung colony of Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with both opportunity and danger.  Warp jumps across vast distances are commonplace, yet the unpredictable nature of space – rogue asteroids, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies – demand constant vigilance.  The cosmos holds untold riches, but reaching them requires courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.
