
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, felt a familiar weight against her back.  This journey to the distant abbey, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with each creak of the saddle and each breathtaking vista, the adventure fueled her spirit, making the hardships seem almost…worthwhile.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  Outside, the swirling nebula of the Andromeda Galaxy painted impossible colours across the viewport.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of space, fraught with dangers both known (meteor showers, hostile alien lifeforms) and unforeseen.  But the potential rewards – a new era of interstellar exploration – far outweighed the risks, pushing Eva and her crew ever onward.
