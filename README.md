
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and meager coins; it contained the hope of reaching the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable wealth.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grasses, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the silent immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to contain a planet teeming with a new, sustainable energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was routine, but the true danger resided in the unknown – alien species, uncharted nebulae, and the chilling possibility of encountering something beyond human comprehension.  The cosmos, a canvas of glittering peril and breathtaking wonder, awaited.
