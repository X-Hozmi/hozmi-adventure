
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised sunset. Their journey from the King's court had been arduous, a tapestry woven with skirmishes against bandits, fording treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigating treacherous mountain paths barely wider than a horse.  Each night brought the gnawing fear of wild beasts and the ever-present threat of rival lords, their scouts a constant shadow in the periphery.  The whispered tales of the legendary city of Eldoria, nestled in the heart of the unexplored east, fuelled their weary steps, a promise of riches and glory outweighing the ever-present dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been smoother than expected, but the real challenge lay ahead:  navigating the treacherous asteroid fields guarding the Kepler-186f system.  Years of training, honed in the rigorous academies of Neo-Earth, had prepared her for the complexities of hyperspace travel and the unpredictable nature of alien landscapes, but the loneliness of deep space and the ever-present threat of pirates and rogue AI still gnawed at her. The promise of new worlds and the potential for discovery was a powerful incentive, driving her onward through the vast, indifferent emptiness of space.
