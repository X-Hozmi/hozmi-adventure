Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to overtake her.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances between star systems still inspired a sense of awe and trepidation.

The cosmic expanse, both beautiful and indifferent, held its breath as they embarked on their perilous journey into the unknown.
