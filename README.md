
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the whispering pines, while the ever-present threat of starvation and disease stalked his every step. Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle against the unforgiving landscape, a relentless test of his courage and resilience as he pushed ever closer to his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  Navigating the cosmic currents, dodging asteroid fields and battling malfunctioning systems, Eva relied on her training and the unwavering loyalty of her crew, their shared ambition fueling their quest for the unknown among the glittering expanse of the cosmos.
