
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the dark forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed commitment to reach her destination, fueled by a thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches or knowledge.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble against the unknown.  Reports of a lost civilization, masters of ancient technology, pulled her forward.  Alien landscapes, uncharted systems, and the constant threat of pirates and cosmic anomalies were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of discovery and the potential to rewrite history, one warp jump at a time.
