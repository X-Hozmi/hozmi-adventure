
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's small band of travelers pressed on. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits had lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers had tested their strength, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the shared hardship forged a bond stronger than any castle wall, their laughter echoing against the vastness of the untamed landscape.  The destination, a distant promise of redemption, spurred them onward through the relentless rhythm of hoofbeats and creaking wagon wheels.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming spores to a newly discovered planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pulls of black holes was a daily challenge.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, punctuated only by the crackle of the comms system and the shared camaraderie of her small crew.  But the vastness of space held a captivating beauty, and the potential to usher in a new era of life for humanity fuelled Eva's unwavering determination to reach her destination, a beacon of hope amongst the infinite stars.
