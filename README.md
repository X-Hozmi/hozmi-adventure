
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Each rocky outcrop held the potential for ambush, each shadowed valley whispered tales of brigands and mythical beasts.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was fraught with peril, a tapestry woven with the threads of scorching sun, freezing nights, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, yet the glimmer of hope fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been smoother than expected, but the unexplored planet held its own dangers: unpredictable gravitational fields, unknown flora and fauna, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Jax’s mission: to secure vital resources for her colony on Proxima Centauri b.  Faster-than-light travel offered a speed Elara could only dream of, but the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns, making this intergalactic voyage a perilous adventure every bit as challenging as the medieval journey across land.
