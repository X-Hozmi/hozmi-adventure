
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming under the harsh midday sun, spurred his destrier onward. The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape, a tapestry of sun-baked earth and scrubby vegetation.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, while nights held the chilling whispers of unseen creatures in the nearby forests.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward, the salvation of his people, fueled his relentless march across the continent.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of starlight and sub-light propulsion, punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms system.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless unknown dangers – from rogue asteroids to hostile alien encounters.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, pressed on, driven by the hope of discovering new life and expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy.
