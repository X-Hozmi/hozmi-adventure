
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Eldoria, the whispers of its healing magic, fueled his weary steps, transforming the harsh realities of medieval travel into an epic, life-or-death adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal predators.  Warp jumps between galaxies were a constant gamble against spatial anomalies, while navigating the complex political landscape of intergalactic trade presented its own set of deadly risks. But Eva, hardened by years of daring exploration, embraced the challenges, driven by the need to secure her crew's future and secure a place for humanity amongst the stars.
