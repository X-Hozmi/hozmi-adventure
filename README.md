
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint, and the tattered map promising a legendary lost city – a city said to hold untold riches and potent magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the plague were carried on the wind itself.  Survival hinged on her wit, her stamina, and the capricious favour of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigation charts pulsed with intricate data streams,  but the true danger lay not in astrophysical anomalies, but in the unpredictable pirate factions that prowled the void, ever hungry for the spoils of galactic exploration.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and hardened spacers, were her only hope against the vastness and peril of the cosmos.
