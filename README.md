
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance like a mirage.  Her journey from Prague has been arduous, fraught with bandits lurking in shadowed forests and treacherous mountain passes.  She carries a precious scroll, a secret map promising untold riches, clutched tightly to her chest, a beacon against the ever-present threat of betrayal and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, a constant negotiation between survival and the pursuit of her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be guarded by sentient flora and unforgiving storms.  Warp jumps between star systems are risky, a dance with unpredictable gravitational forces and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, amplifies the stakes of his mission, transforming every successful jump into a hard-won victory in his ongoing struggle for survival against the crushing indifference of the cosmos.
