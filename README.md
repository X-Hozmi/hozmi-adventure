
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – yet the lure of hope propelled her through treacherous passes and across unforgiving plains, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal anomalies, she and her crew faced the cold, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, their tiny ship a speck of defiance against the unimaginable scale of the galaxy.  The thrill of discovery, the ever-present threat of the unknown, fueled their journey across the vast interstellar ocean.
