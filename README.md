
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel holding all her worldly possessions.  The journey to Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. But the allure of the fabled city, a crossroads of cultures and trade, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but also the thrill of discovery, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the breathtaking beauty of a world largely unexplored.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console. Her mission: to chart a course through unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding population.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, held the same promise of discovery and the unknown as the medieval world had done.
