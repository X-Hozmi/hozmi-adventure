
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the wind.  Her worn leather satchel holds a king's ransom – or so she hopes – a desperate gamble to save her village from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the brush, sends shivers down her spine, the dangers of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease a constant companion on her perilous journey across the fractured kingdom.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck against the immensity of space.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to galactic unity.  But the journey is fraught with peril; pirate fleets lurk in the shadows, asteroid fields threaten to obliterate her vessel, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel itself poses a constant threat.  The weight of galactic peace rests on her shoulders, as far removed from the medieval dangers of Elara as imaginable, yet the inherent risks of her adventure remain just as profound.
