
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled their weary bodies and sharpened their resolve.  They were bound for adventure, a path paved with danger and excitement, a medieval odyssey into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily occurrence, the vastness of space a constant reminder of their isolation.  Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of discovery, but also the chilling possibility of encountering unforeseen dangers.  This was not merely travel; it was exploration on a galactic scale, a journey into the uncharted reaches of the cosmos, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and courage.
