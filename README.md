
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onwards, the muddy track a ribbon snaking through the unforgiving French countryside.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – bandit ambushes hidden in the dense forests, treacherous river crossings swelling with spring rains, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Their quest, a legendary lost city whispered to hold untold riches and ancient knowledge, fuelled their relentless march, pushing them further into the heart of the unknown. The scent of woodsmoke and the distant call of a hunting horn were their only companions in the vast wilderness.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The starship *Stardust*, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy shields, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her crew through nebulae ablaze with vibrant colours and navigated asteroid fields, dodging rogue space rocks the size of mountains.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a beacon of hope for humanity’s future hanging precariously in the balance.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held them captive in its awe-inspiring embrace.
