
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and hopeful scribbles, guides her toward rumored lands of spice and silk.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, and the relentless sun beats down upon her, but the thrill of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and exotic encounters, fuels her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each echoing call of a hawk overhead, is a note in the symphony of her grand adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next giant leap.  His crew, a motley assortment of xeno-biologists and hardened spacers, face the dangers of warp storms and pirate attacks with grim determination. The vast, uncharted expanse of space holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, a cosmic tapestry woven from shimmering starlight and the cold, hard reality of survival in the unforgiving void.
