
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the map to a lost monastery, rumored to hold a sacred relic.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightens the anticipation and danger of her journey.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine are constant companions on this perilous quest across the heart of medieval Europe.  Will she find the monastery, or will the journey itself consume her?


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a remote planet on the edge of known space, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the ever-present dangers of hyperspace travel are but a few obstacles in her path.  The vastness of the galaxy, both beautiful and terrifying, stretches before her – a journey far beyond any medieval adventurer could ever have imagined.
