
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offers little comfort against the biting wind and the gnawing fear of bandits.  The promise of the fabled Sunstone city, whispered in hushed tones across taverns and campfires, fuels her relentless journey, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness that stretches before her. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens her senses, heightening the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation relies less on brittle maps and more on sophisticated astrogation, but the thrill of exploration remains.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling gas and distant suns, holds both wonder and peril.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks are cosmic, the rewards potentially universe-altering;  each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable heart of the galaxy.
