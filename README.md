
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but the seeds of a new life – seeds she carried across half a continent to plant in a rumored valley of plenty.  Each creaking step of her journey was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature, a gamble she willingly took for a future free from the famine gripping her village.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, tested her resolve at every turn.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the 'Starseeker'.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the journey was far from easy.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions made each hyperspace jump a nerve-wracking gamble.  But Jax, hardened by years spent charting the uncharted galaxies, held firm, driven by the hope of finding a new home among the stars.
