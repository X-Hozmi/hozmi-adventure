
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their mission: to reach the Sultan's court in Damascus, bearing a precarious peace treaty clutched in a water-stained leather pouch.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of distant minarets spurred them onward, a beacon promising either glory or grim defeat in the heart of a foreign land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers.  Warp jumps punctuated the endless expanse of space, each one a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  Alien landscapes and hostile species were a constant threat, but the potential reward – salvation for a dying colony light-years away – fuelled her unwavering determination.
