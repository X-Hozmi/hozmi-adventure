
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a meager supply of dried meat, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zamora before winter's grip tightened.  Each rocky path, each whispering forest, held the promise of peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the allure of adventure, the whisper of legend, spurred her onward.  This journey, however fraught with danger, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking immensity of space.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, was risky, a gamble against unpredictable wormhole currents and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, outweighed the dangers.  For Ryla, this interstellar voyage wasn't just a mission; it was the culmination of a generation's dreams, a testament to the indomitable spirit of exploration that echoes across time.
