
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The map, a crudely drawn parchment, promised riches and glory in the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in dusty taverns.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting his own destiny across unmapped lands, fueled his weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the 'Stardust Wanderer'.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, a blur of warp drives and hyperspace jumps, was fraught with its own perils: rogue asteroids, solar flares threatening to fry the ship's systems, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life. Yet, the vastness of space, the challenge of interstellar exploration, and the hope of discovering new worlds drove her and her crew across the uncharted cosmos.
