
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn satchel holds not gold, but seeds – seeds of a new life promised in the fertile valleys of the south.  Bandits, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, yet the unwavering hope of a better future fuels her onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring capacity for adventure despite hardship.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose in this arduous, land-bound odyssey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a fleeing colony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms is a commonplace risk, far removed from Elara's earthly struggles. Yet, the shared thread of adventure remains.  The vastness of space, the unknown dangers lurking around every nebula, and the weight of responsibility for her crew’s survival all fuel Ryla's courage and determination, echoing the spirit of adventurers across time and space.
