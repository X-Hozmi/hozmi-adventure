
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a warning of impending war.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Survival, not glory, was the true adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years away.  The journey wasn't about conquering new lands, but about the uncharted possibilities of life beyond Earth, the thrill of discovery amidst the cold, uncaring vastness of space.  The risks were different – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, the unknown itself – but the spirit of adventure burned just as bright.
