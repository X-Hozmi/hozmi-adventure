
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and frantic scribbles, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the whisper of ancient magic and untold riches fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, and each sunset a deeper understanding of the resilience of the human spirit against the brutal realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were commonplace hazards, but the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risks. The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas painted with swirling gases and distant suns, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Eva dreamt not of gold or magic, but of discovering life beyond Earth, a quest far grander than any medieval adventure.
