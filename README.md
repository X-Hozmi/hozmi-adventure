
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the burning hope in his heart, fueled by sisterly love, kept him pushing ever forward, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting kindnesses from strangers, and the relentless beauty of the unknown landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, throwing the ship violently.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colonized planet of Kepler-186f, a world battling a devastating drought.  Across the vast expanse of the galaxy, she navigated asteroid fields, dodged pirate ships, and faced the constant threat of engine failure.  But the thought of the Keplerians, their survival hanging in the balance, spurred her on, the cosmos a breathtaking, yet perilous, highway to her destination.
