
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a clumsy tapestry of sweating horses, creaking wagons, and weary travelers, snaked its way across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the insidious creep of dysentery. Yet, the allure of the East, of silks and spices beyond the known world, fuelled our onward journey.  We navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers, and traded stories around crackling fires under the vast, indifferent stars – a testament to human resilience and the insatiable thirst for the unknown.

Conversely, imagine piloting the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, in the 27th century.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes is a daily challenge, the cosmos a breathtaking but unforgiving mistress.  Each jump to a new planet holds the promise of undiscovered species, unimaginable landscapes, and the potential for both incredible riches and unimaginable danger.  The thrill of interstellar travel, though vastly different from its medieval counterpart, shares the same core: the courageous exploration of the vast unknown, a human desire stretching across centuries and light-years.
