
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map – the key to finding the lost monastery rumored to hold the legendary Sunstone.  Bandits lurked in every shadow, the biting wind a constant companion, and the gnawing hunger a relentless foe. Yet, the whispered legends of untold riches and forgotten magic spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, indifferent landscape.  Each sunrise brought new peril, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylian crystals to the distant Kepler-186f colony, a planet teeming with life but desperate for resources.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, pirates a constant threat, and the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula tested the limits of her ship's aging engines.  But Nova, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, was unyielding. The survival of a planet depended on her arrival, a responsibility far greater than any personal risk.
