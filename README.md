His trusty steed, a dappled grey mare, picked its way across the rough, dirt track, the rhythmic clip-clop of its hooves a calming counterpoint to the pounding in his chest. He was bound for the legendary City of Gold, a place whispered about in hushed tones at taverns, a place said to be guarded by fierce beasts and ancient curses. Fear mingled with excitement, but the lure of unimaginable riches was too strong to resist.  He had traded the safety and comfort of his home for the unknown, for a chance at glory.

The thrill of the unknown, of venturing beyond the confines of known space,  was a powerful draw, a siren call that beckoned her to explore the uncharted corners of the universe.
