
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the Kingdom of Francia.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled my nostrils, a stark contrast to the stale air of the city I’d left behind.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague hung heavy in the air, but the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, with its fabled treasures and arcane knowledge, spurred me onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were my roadmap.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we leaped across the void, leaving the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way behind.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel itself.  But the vastness of space held dangers far beyond the grasp of medieval knights.  Nebulae, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms tested the limits of our technology and our courage, making this intergalactic voyage a far more perilous undertaking than any terrestrial adventure.
