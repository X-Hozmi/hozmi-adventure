
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unpredictable landscape.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the harsh reality of the road ahead; a testament to the courage and resilience needed to survive in a world where adventure often meant facing death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unknown.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate incursions, and battling the unpredictable whims of warp-space were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space, filled with the promise of discovery and the chilling threat of the unseen, made every jump through hyperspace a gamble, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration beyond the familiar.
