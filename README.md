
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease lay between him and his goal.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bartering for food, navigating by the stars, and always, the watchful eye cast upon him by strangers, friend or foe. The whispered tales of mythical creatures and haunted castles only added to the palpable sense of adventure and the unknown that filled every stage of his arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of subspace comms and the occasional alert from the navigation system.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced the challenge not of bandits, but of asteroid fields, radiation storms, and the chilling vastness of space itself.  The thrill of discovery, the promise of uncovering new life and charting unmapped territories, fueled their courage as they ventured into the cosmic unknown.
