
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, more faded prayer than guide, promised a monastery harboring a legendary healer – the only hope for her plague-stricken brother.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliff faces, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward, a flicker of defiance in the bleak expanse.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the unexplored galaxy of Aethelred, a journey fraught with uncharted asteroid fields and potential encounters with hostile alien races.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Ryla's crew, a ragtag band of explorers and mercenaries, were bound together by a shared thirst for discovery and the promise of untold riches – or perhaps, an even more valuable prize: knowledge of the universe's deepest secrets.
