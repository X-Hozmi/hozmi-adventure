
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's mare as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the biting wind, but the thrill of the journey, the whispered tales of the lost city of Ys spurring her on, outweighed any discomfort. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the promise of discovery, of uncovering ancient secrets, fueled her relentless pursuit across the land.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Nebulae painted vibrant strokes across the void, the colossal spiral arms of the Andromeda galaxy a breathtaking spectacle.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach.  The journey wasn't about bandits or hunger, but about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling temporal distortions, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Yet, the infinite possibilities of the cosmos, the chance to discover new life and new worlds, made the dangers pale in comparison.
