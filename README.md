
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope for his sister spurred him on, each sunrise a promise of another step closer to salvation, even as the vast, unknown expanse of the medieval world stretched before him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across a dozen different planets after a catastrophic solar flare.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating alien storms, the vastness of space both breathtaking and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace offered a new gamble, a test of skill and courage against the unknown perils of the galaxy.
