
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and resolute spirits, pushing them ever closer to their perilous destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, scattered across the uncharted galaxies after a catastrophic warp-jump failure.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the insidious effects of prolonged hyperspace travel were all in a day's work for Eva.  But the true test lay in finding the scattered remnants of Nova Terra – a task that demanded not only navigational skill and courage, but also the ability to inspire hope amidst the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
