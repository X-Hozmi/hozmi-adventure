
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cacophony of hawkers and the stench of unwashed bodies.  Now, weeks later, we trudge across the sun-baked plains of France, our meager supplies dwindling.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or disease, but the lure of the fabled Silk Road, whispered promises of spices and unimaginable riches, keeps our weary feet moving.  The creak of our cart wheels, the rhythmic thud of our horses' hooves, are the soundtrack to our perilous adventure, a constant reminder of the vast and unpredictable world stretching before us.

Conversely,  in the 27th century, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a comforting constant as we leap between star systems.  The vibrant nebulae swirling outside our viewport are a breathtaking spectacle, far removed from the mundane concerns of Earth.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Cygnus X-1 region, a galaxy teeming with potential resources and untold dangers.  While we face the threat of rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes, the scale of our journey, a breathtaking dance among celestial bodies, fuels our courage and stokes our relentless quest for the unknown.
