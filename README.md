
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a worn map, its faded ink promising riches and adventure in the far-off city of Constantinople.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of danger and wonder that permeated this journey across a continent fractured by war and rumour.  Bandits, famine, and the unpredictable whims of nature were her constant companions, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Ahead lay the unexplored galaxy of Andromeda, a swirling vortex of potential discovery and terrifying unknowns.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the void, but the promise of new worlds, alien civilizations, and unimaginable resources fuelled her insatiable thirst for exploration.  The cosmos, boundless and unforgiving, was both her playground and her greatest challenge.
