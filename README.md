
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Every creak of saddle leather and rustle of the wind held the promise of either triumph or despair, the fate of their people hanging in the balance of this perilous journey.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', her ship a tiny speck against the immeasurable backdrop of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae in search of a new source of energy.  The journey spanned light-years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen celestial events,  alien encounters both benevolent and hostile.  The vastness of space, a terrifying beauty, both enthralled and humbled Eva, reminding her constantly of the insignificance of one ship, one crew, against the overwhelming grandeur of the universe.
