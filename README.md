
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles compared to the daunting journey itself.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, balanced against the gnawing fear of the unknown that lay ahead across the endless, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the disparate colonies scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, yet the dangers remained: unpredictable space storms, pirate factions lurking in the black, and the ever-present risk of encountering alien lifeforms, some friendly, some decidedly not.  The cosmos was a vast, unpredictable ocean, and Eva, with her seasoned crew, navigated its treacherous currents with courage and skill.
