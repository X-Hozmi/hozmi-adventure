
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both beast and rider tumbling, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any highwayman.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's enchanted libraries and powerful relics fueled her onward, a flicker of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the quarantined colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from her home.  The jump through hyperspace had been harrowing, the jump-drive threatening to overload, but the sight of Kepler-186f's twin suns rising above the horizon, a promise of life and salvation for its desperate inhabitants, made the risk worthwhile. The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a lonely and dangerous place.
