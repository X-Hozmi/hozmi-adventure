
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned: a few meager coins, dried herbs, and a map more faded than her hopes.  Ahead lay the rumored lost monastery of Saint Gildas, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whisper of ancient secrets and the promise of untold riches spurred her onward, each creak of the mule's saddle a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, 'Stardust'.  The shimmering gas clouds hid untold dangers, from rogue asteroids to the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unseen celestial bodies.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, a network of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space dwarfed even her courage, but the potential rewards – a breakthrough for interstellar exploration – were a siren call, urging her deeper into the cosmic unknown.
