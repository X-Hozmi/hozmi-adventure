
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her loyal destrier, Shadowfax, struggling under the weight of their meager supplies.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits, harsh weather, and treacherous terrain were but a few obstacles between her and her quest, yet the glint of adventure in her eyes burned brighter than the midday sun.  Each step was a gamble, a wager against the unknown, a testament to the unwavering spirit of the medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster teeming with uncharted planets, each potentially harboring life, resources, or unimaginable danger.  The vast distances and unpredictable cosmic phenomena were constant threats, but the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unexplored, fueled her relentless journey across the galaxies. The cosmos was her medieval plain, but instead of a horse, she rode the currents of spacetime.
