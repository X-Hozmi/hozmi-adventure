
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining with the weight of his pack, urged his weary horse onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a gritty shroud obscuring the already hazy horizon.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Lancaster, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present fear of disease stalked him like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the malice of men.

Conversely, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and potentially hostile fauna.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the unpredictable nature of the alien ecosystems she would soon encounter.  Her advanced tech was her shield, but the vastness of space, and the unpredictable nature of the universe, was a constant, humbling reminder of the inherent risks of interstellar travel.
