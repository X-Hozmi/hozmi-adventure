
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate gamble on reaching the rumored fertile lands beyond the king's border.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – a constant reminder of the perilous nature of her journey.  The looming castles and fortified towns offered little comfort, often as likely to exploit as to protect.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions – a new frontier in humanity's relentless expansion.  The vastness of space was a different kind of perilous, with unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure lurking.  But unlike Elara's medieval trek, Eva’s journey was fueled by advanced technology, a ship capable of traversing light-years, allowing her to reach for the stars in a quest for survival and discovery.
