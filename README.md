
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and the meager coin she'd earned.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, scorching heat, and treacherous terrain are constant threats, yet the lure of the unknown – of pushing beyond the familiar borders of her village – propels her onward, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, hints at the adventure that awaits, both perilous and exhilarating.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust Drifter*, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's boundless ambition.  Navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos, she and her crew are on a mission to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable planets and new forms of energy.  The dangers are different now –  rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – yet the spirit of exploration remains the same. The cosmos stretches before them, an infinite tapestry of wonder and peril, demanding courage, ingenuity, and an unyielding thirst for the unknown.
