
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  She was bound for Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by desperation and a whispered rumour of a miracle cure.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse – the very real threat of the Black Death stalking the land.  Her journey was a gamble against fate, a desperate race against time itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vastness of space held its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of discovery, the potential to find survivors amidst the cosmic unknown, fueled her unwavering resolve.  The journey was a test of courage, technology, and the enduring spirit of exploration.
