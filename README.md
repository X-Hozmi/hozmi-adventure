
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather jerkin held little more than a waterskin, a few dried figs, and the map – its edges frayed and smudged with dirt – that promised a legendary lost city nestled amidst treacherous mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease; but the lure of adventure, the whisper of untold riches and forgotten knowledge, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut a shimmering path across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating asteroid fields and nebulae was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of interstellar travel permits, the dangers posed by rogue K'tharr pirates, or the ever-present threat of warp-core instability. Yet, the promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a chance to chart unmapped galaxies and unveil the universe’s deepest secrets, was a siren song that even the vast, unforgiving expanse of space couldn't silence.
