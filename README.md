
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains. Their journey from York to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating unfamiliar terrain, bartering for meager supplies in hostile villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for potential enemies. Yet, the unwavering promise of Jerusalem fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across lightyears of interstellar space.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, wasn't merely about distance; it was about navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels from the Andromeda Galaxy, and enduring the psychological toll of months spent in the isolating vastness of space. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, but the promise of a new beginning on a potentially habitable planet made the risks worthwhile.
