
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the endless expanse of the Sahara.  Bandits, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies were constant companions on this perilous journey across the known world, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's lost treasures, and the chance to map uncharted territories, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky; wormhole instability was a constant threat.  But the promise of discovering a new, habitable world, a world teeming with unknown life and resources, outweighed the danger. Each hyperspace jump was a leap of faith, a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable thirst for exploration across the unimaginable distances between the stars.
