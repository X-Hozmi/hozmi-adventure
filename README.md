
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to claim their lives, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, with each sunrise, their determination burned brighter, fueled by faith and the promise of untold wonders hidden beyond the next treacherous bend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unpredictable alien flora and fauna.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of K'tharr raiders, Eva’s journey was a breathtaking ballet of calculated risks and daring maneuvers across the vast expanse of space.  The galaxy offered unimaginable riches, but its dangers were equally immense.
