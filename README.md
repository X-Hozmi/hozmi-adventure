
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of exotic spices and shimmering silks that fueled his journey eastward. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill and terror of the unknown. Bandits, disease, and treacherous terrain were constant companions, but the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, pushed him relentlessly onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Elara Reyes, her knuckles white on the controls of the *Starseeker*, navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The shimmering cosmic dust, a breathtaking spectacle, was also a deadly hazard, threatening to overwhelm her ship's shields. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with dangers both known – pirate raids – and unknown – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself. The vastness of space offered an unparalleled freedom, but also a terrifying solitude, a constant reminder of the fragile nature of life against the backdrop of the infinite.
