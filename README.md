
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my mule onward, the biting wind whipping at my cloak.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World, a treacherous mountain range rumored to hold both untold riches and terrifying beasts. My meager supplies, a map stained with age and questionable advice from a grizzled tavern owner, were all that stood between me and the unknown.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the snow-laden pines, held the promise of adventure – and the ever-present threat of danger.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion, a soothing drone against the vast emptiness of interstellar space.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, faced the unknown with a mix of excitement and apprehension.  The risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering unforeseen cosmic phenomena was ever present, but the potential rewards – a breakthrough that could change the fate of humanity – fueled our journey across the galactic tapestry.
