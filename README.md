
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his mule through the dense Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape. He carries with him only a meager supply of food, his trusty sword, and the unwavering hope that his sister will survive.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the fabled Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Her mission: to locate a new source of the rare element Xylium, crucial for interstellar travel.  Asteroids, rogue planets, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations are merely obstacles in her path.  Armed with cutting-edge technology and an unwavering spirit of exploration, she navigates the cosmos, driven by the same thirst for adventure that spurred Thomas on his medieval journey.
