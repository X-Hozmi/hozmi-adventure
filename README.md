
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the rutted track as I rode, the chill wind whipping across the vast, empty plains of France.  My destination: the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Every creak of my saddle, every rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or perhaps something far more sinister.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, propelled me onward.  My meager supplies dwindled, but my spirit remained unbroken; Ys, or ruin, awaited.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  We chased a whisper of the Ancients, a civilization lost to time and space, their rumored technology promising the end to interstellar famine.  The cosmos stretched before us, a tapestry of nebulas and star clusters, yet our journey was not without peril.  Rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the creeping loneliness of deep space threatened to consume us. But the promise of discovery, the chance to glimpse the Ancients' secrets, fueled our daring expedition across the uncharted reaches of the universe.
