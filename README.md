
The year is 1348.  Our weary band, comprised of a grizzled knight, a nimble rogue, and a scholarly monk, trudged onward, the muddy track a testament to weeks of relentless travel.  Each sunrise revealed a fresh challenge – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation in the barren stretches between villages. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, propelled them forward, their determination fueled by whispered legends and the glint of distant mountains promising both danger and reward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her crew a diverse team of xeno-linguists, engineers, and mercenaries.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and deciphering ancient star charts, their journey was a constant battle against the unforgiving vastness of space, a race against time to reach a lost world before it faded completely into legend.
