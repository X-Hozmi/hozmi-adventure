
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them on through sun-drenched valleys and shadowy forests, their journey a tapestry woven with bravery, hardship, and the enduring spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped cosmic anomalies and pirate attacks.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive filled the bridge as they leaped between star systems, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders a constant reminder of the awe-inspiring scale of their interstellar expedition.  Each jump was a gamble, each destination a mystery, but the promise of discovery fueled their relentless pursuit across the vast, uncharted expanse of space.
