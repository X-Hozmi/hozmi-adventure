
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the rutted track, the midday sun a relentless hammer on her back.  Her small band, a motley collection of knights, merchants, and a surprisingly cheerful thief named Finn, pressed on towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision needed to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Every jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien patrols, but for Ryla, the challenge was the reward, the endless frontier her true home.
