The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of the treacherous Whispering Mountains looming on the horizon. His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elmo – was a perilous journey demanding courage, resilience, and a healthy distrust of anyone offering ale and hospitality along the King's Road.

The vast expanse of the cosmos held untold riches and unimaginable dangers, promising a journey that would test not only her piloting skills, but the very limits of human ambition.
