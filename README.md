
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Our journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the promise of the holy city, and the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, spurred us onward, each step a testament to human resilience against the brutal beauty of the medieval world.  The clink of our worn-out armour was a constant reminder of our adventure, the echoes of which would linger long after our return.

Millennia later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars, as we jumped across the vast gulf separating us from Xylos. Our mission: to retrieve the lost artifacts of the Xylar civilization before the Kryll Hegemony could get their claws on them.  The dangers of interstellar travel are far removed from those faced in the medieval period, but the thrill, the excitement of charting unknown territories, the weight of responsibility,  they remain constant echoes across the vast expanse of time and space. The journey was far from over, but already this galactic odyssey dwarfed even the boldest medieval quest.
