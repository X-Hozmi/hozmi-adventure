
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and magic, or so the legends claimed.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the peaks, and the biting wind threatened frostbite, but the lure of adventure, the promise of untold riches and perhaps even a cure for her ailing brother, spurred her onward. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrill and the fear that kept her heart pounding.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across a dozen planets following a catastrophic warp storm.  Faster-than-light travel was risky, the dangers of space-borne anomalies ever-present, but the thought of finding the missing colonists, of bringing them home, fueled her unwavering resolve.  Each jump through hyperspace, each perilous landing on a new world, was a step closer to her goal, a testament to the enduring human spirit of exploration even amongst the vastness of the cosmos.
