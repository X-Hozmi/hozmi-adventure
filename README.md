
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, a beacon of hope in a dying world, spurred them onward, each hardship forging a stronger bond between knight and squire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the newly discovered Kepler-186f system.  Warp jumps were risky, the unknown dangers of uncharted space a constant threat.  But the potential rewards – rare minerals, exotic lifeforms, and the expansion of human civilization – outweighed the perils. Each jump was a leap of faith, a thrilling gamble in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
