
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track snaked across the parched landscape, offering little respite from the relentless sun.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered to hold untold riches and even more dangerous secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the challenges facing him and his small band of companions as they ventured into the unknown, their resolve hardened by the lure of adventure and the promise of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through the cosmic dust.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, a beacon of hope in a vast, uncharted galaxy.  But the journey was far from safe; rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks made every light-year a gamble.  For Elara and her crew, the endless expanse of space held not just the allure of discovery, but also the terrifying reality of a universe brimming with both wonder and danger.
