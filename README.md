
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to swallow their meager supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to their resilience, forging a bond stronger than any castle wall.  The whispered tales of the monastery's healing powers fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of traversing intergalactic space.  Cosmic storms raged, threatening to tear her ship apart, and the vast emptiness between stars pressed in on her crew, fueling the creeping dread of isolation. But the tantalizing prospect of discovering a new frontier, a new home for humanity, spurred them onward.  The galaxy held its breath, waiting to see if humanity could truly reach for the stars.
