
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, kept him pressing forward, a solitary knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of space pirates tested her skill and courage.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled her determination, making the interstellar journey a thrilling and perilous adventure.
