
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a testament to the miles already conquered, each sunset a promise of new dangers.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were the constant companions of their journey to the fabled city of Constantinople.  Their quest for a lost relic fueled their determination, pushing them onward despite the hardships and uncertainties that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Warp drives hummed, defying the limitations of space and time as they journeyed between galaxies, seeking a lost colony rumored to possess knowledge that could save their dying world.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, alien encounters and unforeseen gravitational anomalies threatening to consume them.  But the hope of finding a new beginning spurred them onward, across the immeasurable distances of the universe.
