
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the whispers of plague hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance and courage, but the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerian piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the kaleidoscopic colours shifted and pulsed around her ship.  Galaxies stretched before her like an endless ocean of stars, each a potential destination, each holding untold wonders and dangers.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel, was risky, but the reward – the potential to unlock the secrets of the universe – outweighed any fear.  The cosmos was their playground, vast and unforgiving, yet endlessly alluring.
