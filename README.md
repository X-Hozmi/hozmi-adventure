
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  Dust swirled around them, a ochre cloud clinging to the relentless sun.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a whispered legend among travellers, said to swallow men and horses whole.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril, not only from the swamp’s treacherous depths, but from bandits and the ever-present threat of wild beasts lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  Nebulae storms raged around them, a cosmic ballet of lethal radiation and gravitational anomalies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos Prime, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the brilliant glow of distant galaxies, held its own dangers – pirate fleets, rogue asteroids, and the unsettling silence of the void.  But Elara, with her steely gaze and unwavering determination, pressed on, each jump through hyperspace bringing her closer to the unknown, and perhaps, to salvation.
