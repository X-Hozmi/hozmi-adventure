
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, bound for the fabled city of Constantinople.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the plague that stalked the land.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hopeful scribbles, was her only guide, promising riches and perhaps, a new life beyond the shadowed borders of her homeland.  The journey was arduous, a constant test of endurance and wit, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing vital systems in the unforgiving void were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a different kind of adventure – one where the stakes were cosmic, the rewards unimaginable, and the unknown a constant companion.
