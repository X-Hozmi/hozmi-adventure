
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the possibility of unearthing lost knowledge, spurred her onward, a flicker of defiance against the mundane existence of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their hyperdrive sputtered, threatening to leave them stranded halfway between the Andromeda galaxy and the Kepler-186f system.  The mission: retrieve a vital bio-sample from a newly discovered planet, a journey fraught with the perils of uncharted nebulae and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  But Rexx, a seasoned spacefarer, felt the familiar surge of adrenaline—the same exhilarating risk that drove adventurers of old, only now amongst the shimmering constellations and the cold vacuum of space.
