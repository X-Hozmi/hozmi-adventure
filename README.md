
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her mule laden with meager supplies.  Bandits lurk in the shadows, the whispers of plague ride the wind, and the vast, unforgiving landscape stretches before her – a tapestry of hardship woven with the promise of a new life in the distant city of Constantinople. Each sunrise brings the threat of starvation or violence, each sunset the quiet solace of a fire under a star-studded sky, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of relentless adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Meridian pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of its dying star painting the cockpit in hues of blood and fire.  His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to house creatures far beyond human comprehension.  Hyperspace jumps are risky, alien encounters even more so, yet the thrill of exploration, the siren call of the unknown, fuels his every decision. The vastness of space, while terrifying, promises riches beyond imagining.
