
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs for the plague. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the brutal realities of a harsh landscape. Yet, the lure of salvation, the yearning for a better future, pushed her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy stretching before her starship.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the resources to save a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained: unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of encountering alien civilizations with hostile intentions.  But the weight of humanity's survival fueled her determination, a burning star guiding her through the inky blackness of space.
