
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mud.  Ahead, the looming peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promised both peril and passage to the fabled Sunken City.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than her grandfather – a testament to the arduous journey she’d undertaken,  a journey fuelled by whispers of untold riches and the desperate hope of saving her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the ever-present sense of adventure, and the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan adjusted his grav-harness, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted across the viewport of his starship *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Nird, a world rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Empire demanded nerves of steel and impeccable piloting skills – skills Rexx possessed in abundance.  The thrill of exploring uncharted galaxies, facing down alien threats, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge overshadowed any fear, making every jump through hyperspace a potent cocktail of adrenaline and exhilaration.
