
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful Baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this untamed land.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements were constant companions on her perilous journey across the continent, a test of endurance and cunning that would forge her into someone stronger than she ever imagined.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the vibrant nebula outside his starship swirling into a kaleidoscope of impossible colours.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  The cosmos, however, was not a benign highway.  Pirate raiders, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events made each interstellar voyage a gamble with fate.  But for Rexx, the thrill of exploration and the promise of discovery far outweighed the risks.
