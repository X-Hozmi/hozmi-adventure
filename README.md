
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a haven said to hold the cure for her brother's illness, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of enchanted forests and forgotten ruins, fueled her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unpredictable landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's ethereal glow.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Xylos galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and facing the chilling vacuum of space were everyday realities.  But the lure of discovery, the potential for finding new life, new worlds brimming with untold wonders, propelled her forward, a lone explorer against the breathtaking, terrifying immensity of the cosmos.
