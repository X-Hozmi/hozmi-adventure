
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious barley destined for a monastery far beyond the reach of the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, but the promise of survival, of a future for her people, spurred her onward through treacherous passes and unforgiving terrain, her journey a desperate gamble against both nature and fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the quiet fear gnawing at her – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the potential for catastrophic engine failure, the chilling vastness of space itself. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new life, and the weight of humanity's future rested on her capable shoulders, a far cry from the medieval treks of her ancestors, yet sharing the same underlying spirit of courageous, relentless pursuit.
