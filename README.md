
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for banditry, disease, or worse.  But the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, through muddy tracks and sun-baked plains, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of hardship and the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes, Eva's journey was a symphony of calculated risks and breathtaking cosmic vistas.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, dwarfed even the grandest medieval adventures, yet the same human drive for discovery burned bright in her heart as it had in Elara's.
