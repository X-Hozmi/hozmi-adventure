
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret of eternal youth.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his onward progress, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by breathtaking celestial displays and the constant hum of the ship's engines, was a different kind of wilderness than Thomas had known.  Yet, the risks – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel – were no less perilous,  making her journey a modern epic of courage and exploration.
