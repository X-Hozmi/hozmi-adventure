
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's band of weary travelers trudged across the sun-baked plains.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each step brought them closer to the unknown, to bandits lurking in shadowed canyons and the unforgiving expanse of the desert.  Their only allies were their unwavering faith and the battered map clutched in Kaelan's hand, a promise of salvation or certain doom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago.  Charting a course through asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes, she faced not only the dangers of space but the ghosts of her own past.  The vastness of the cosmos held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, but the faintest signal of Kepler-186f fueled her journey, a solitary star in the infinite darkness.
