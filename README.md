
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes her weary mule across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her satchel, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, bounces against her hip.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village is a siren's call, but the King's decree demands her presence in Avignon – a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpens her senses, reminding her that survival depends on her wit and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope swallowed by the vast emptiness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien maps are all part of the daily grind.  The cosmic canvas outside her viewport is a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and dying stars, a constant reminder of the unimaginable scale of the universe and the fragile nature of her mission.  The fate of a lost civilization rests on her shoulders, light-years away from any familiar comfort.
