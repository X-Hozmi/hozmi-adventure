
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispers of Ys, the promise of salvation, propelled him forward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago.  Navigating through asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and battling the relentless pull of black holes, she and her crew faced perils far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  But the possibility of finding survivors, of rekindling a lost flame, drove them through the cosmic ocean, a testament to the enduring human spirit's desire to explore the unknown.
