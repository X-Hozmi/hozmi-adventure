
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in the saddlebags – not gold, but a collection of rare herbs sought by a desperate monastery.  His journey had already claimed two pack mules and almost his own life, with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of fever his constant companions.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unseen dangers and exotic lifeforms.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable warp currents were all part of a day's work for Eva and her seasoned crew.  The vastness of space held unimaginable beauty, but also harbored terrifying unknowns, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble, a thrilling leap into the breathtaking, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
