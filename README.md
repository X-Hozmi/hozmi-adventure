
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort in the vast, uncertain landscape. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought the peril of bandits, the gnawing uncertainty of unfamiliar terrain, and the constant threat of starvation, yet the hope of salvation spurred him on, pushing him deeper into the untamed heart of Europe.


Centuries later, Elara’s sleek starship sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant, swirling galaxies.  Her mission: to chart unexplored star systems and search for signs of habitable planets, a desperate attempt to find a new home for humanity after Earth's collapse.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, the potential for discovery tempered by the ever-present risk of encountering unknown and hostile life forms, or worse, the silent, unforgiving emptiness of the void.
