
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and distant war clinging to the air. Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Aethelred, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed each sunrise. Yet, with each sunrise, she found renewed determination in the unwavering glint of the silver amulet around her neck, a reminder of her ailing brother and the hope that fueled her arduous trek.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Vex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Jumping between galaxies was routine, but the dangers were no less real: unpredictable wormhole collapses, pirate attacks from the K'tharr Confederacy, and the ever-present threat of encountering uncharted, hostile space.  Her mission, to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, was a gamble with the universe itself, but the potential rewards outweighed the staggering risks.
