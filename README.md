
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Banditry was common, and the whispers of plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each step, his resolve hardened, fueled by faith and the unwavering hope of reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task that required navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and enduring months of isolation amidst the breathtaking, alien beauty of deep space. The vastness of the cosmos held both unparalleled wonder and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, fueled by scientific curiosity and a thirst for discovery, pressed onward, a lone explorer charting the uncharted territories of the universe.
