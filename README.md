
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each bend in the path held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of ancient magic still clung to these woods.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – demanded perseverance, a resource as precious as water in this unforgiving land.  He pressed on, the weight of his duty a heavier burden than any packhorse could carry.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts was commonplace, but the loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion.  The vast, indifferent expanse of space dwarfed her ship, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable grandeur. Yet, the hope of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her journey across the cosmic ocean.
