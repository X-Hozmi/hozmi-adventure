
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley in fiery hues. Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the tales sung in taverns.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of sickness were daily companions. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the whispered legends of miracles and the unwavering hope of reaching her destination.  The rough-hewn path, though arduous, held a beauty of its own, revealing the stark, breathtaking grandeur of a world largely untouched by civilization.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and ethereal cosmic dust, held a different kind of danger than Elara's medieval journey.  Instead of bandits, it was rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational fields; instead of disease, it was the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile life forms.  Yet, the boundless expanse beckoned, promising discoveries that could rewrite the history of humankind.
