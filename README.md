
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the thrill of her journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a quest fueled by faith and a thirst for the unknown. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of adventure, of unexpected encounters with both kindness and cruelty, of landscapes as varied and unpredictable as the human heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the sight of the emerald-hued planet below.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey fraught with perils unseen and unheard of on Earth.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to unravel ancient mysteries and forge new alliances among the stars, far outweighed the risk.
