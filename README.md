
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the crisp autumn air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and personal annotations, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the thrill of discovery, the whisper of ancient secrets waiting to be unearthed, fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a deeper appreciation for the strength she found within herself.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, vibrant colours painting the viewport in swirling galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and untold dangers. Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of failing life support were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than the medieval wilderness, but the allure of the unknown, the promise of new worlds and civilizations, pulsed like a vibrant star within her.
