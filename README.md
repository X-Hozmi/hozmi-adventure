
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of ancient magic, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the unforgiving desert threatened to swallow her whole.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of discovering something extraordinary, fueled her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, had been successful, but the journey was far from over.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held countless wonders and untold dangers, a constant reminder that the universe was a boundless, unforgiving, and ultimately rewarding frontier to explore.
