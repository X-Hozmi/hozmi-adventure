
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each creak of their saddle leather and each sunrise painting the sky anew, their adventure unfolded, a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the breathtaking beauty of a world largely untamed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, offering glimpses of breathtaking cosmic phenomena, but the dangers were equally immense – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the unknown entities lurking in the uncharted regions of the galaxy.  Every jump was a gamble, every encounter a potential life-or-death struggle, but the lure of discovery, the promise of finding her lost kin, fueled her unwavering determination.
