
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar dialects to bartering for scarce provisions. Yet, with every sunrise, came the invigorating thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands and the unwavering hope of reaching her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity. The journey spanned light years, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and hostile alien lifeforms.  While technological marvels like hyperdrive and shields offered protection, the vastness of space and the loneliness of interstellar travel were constants, demanding both courage and an unwavering spirit of exploration.
