
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Elara nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains, had already tested their endurance. Bandit ambushes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely inconveniences compared to the gnawing uncertainty of their destination – a place spoken of in hushed tones, shrouded in myth and legend.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of their horses was a reminder of the vast and unforgiving landscape stretching before them.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble freighter traversing the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: delivering a vital shipment of bio-engineered flora to the Kepler-186f colony.  The journey was fraught with peril; unpredictable nebulae, pirate attacks from the Kryll syndicate, and the ever-present risk of warp core failure were constant companions.  But the vast cosmic canvas, a tapestry of nebulas and distant suns, held a breathtaking beauty that fueled her adventurous spirit, a stark contrast to the mundane trade routes she usually traversed.
