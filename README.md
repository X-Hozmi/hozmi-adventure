
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, propelled him forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to possess a revolutionary energy source.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were commonplace hazards on her journey across the galaxy.  Unlike Thomas, she had technology on her side, but the loneliness of space, the vast emptiness between worlds, posed a different kind of daunting challenge, a cosmic echo of Thomas's solitary pilgrimage.
