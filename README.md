
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the key to curing her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of overcoming hardship, fueled her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, terrifying emptiness of interstellar space.  Ahead lay the challenges of alien ecosystems, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But for Eva, the vastness of space wasn't a deterrent; it was a canvas upon which to paint her own heroic adventure, a testament to human courage in the face of unimaginable distances.
