
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll – the once-proud knight and his small band were weary, their supplies dwindling.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be home to brigands and worse.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and powerful magic, spurred them onward, each step a gamble against starvation, bandits, and the unforgiving wilderness.  The thrill of the unknown, the hope of glory, outweighed the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, each a leap of faith into the vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos.  Alien life, potentially hostile, lurked in the shadows of unexplored systems.  But the possibility of rediscovering lost humanity, of unraveling the mystery behind the colony's disappearance, fueled her determination, making the unimaginable distances and inherent risks a small price to pay for the ultimate adventure.
