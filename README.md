
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights crested the hill, the sun beating down on their worn leather and chainmail. Before them stretched the unforgiving landscape of the Duchy of Aquitaine, a tapestry of sun-baked fields and treacherous forests rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse. Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Bordeaux, a journey fraught with peril from both man and nature, where each sunrise brought the chilling certainty of unforeseen challenges and the ever-present threat of death.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and new resources for the struggling Terran Federation.  While shielded from the harsh vacuum of space,  the dangers remained equally real – unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from any rescue. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of the cosmos.
