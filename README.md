Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.

But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of first contact, and the chance to expand human knowledge fueled her crew’s determination, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the vast and thrilling unknown.
