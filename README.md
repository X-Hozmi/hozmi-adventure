
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, a stark contrast to the chilling rumors of bandits and the unforgiving wilderness that lay ahead.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Eldoria – had taken him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-infested forests, and across rivers swollen with spring melt. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a gnawing uncertainty, yet the lure of adventure, and the whispered promise of ancient magic, propelled him ever closer to his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a sentient crystalline lifeform.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  With each jump, the ship risked being lost to the chaotic currents of the cosmos, a gamble Eva was willing to take for the chance to uncover a civilization that might rewrite the history of galactic exploration.  The vastness of space held both immense danger and unimaginable wonder.
