
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the sense of adventure and peril, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed world stretching before her.  Wolves howled in the distance, a chilling symphony to her solitary journey.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: the fabled K'tharr system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates, Comet felt the thrill of exploration pulse through him.  The vastness of space, the vibrant colours of alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport, were a constant reminder of the boundless possibilities – and the immeasurable risks – inherent in charting the unknown reaches of the galaxy.
