Her journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the key to her family's lost legacy, spurred her onwards, each hardship a test of her resolve and a step closer to her destiny.  The rough-hewn track stretched before her, a ribbon of uncertainty unwinding into the distant horizon.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take years, even decades, traversing unimaginable distances and facing the unknown dangers of unmapped space.  While shielded from the harshness of the void, the crew faced different kinds of risks: rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone explorers.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for finding new worlds and civilizations, outweighed the perils, driving them onward into the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
