
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her homespun tunic.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had been fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience. Yet, the tantalizing promise of lost knowledge and untold riches spurred her onward, each sunrise painting a new vista of breathtaking landscapes and hidden dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of unimaginable speed as it jumped across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of intergalactic pirates was commonplace on her trade routes.  The vastness of space, speckled with nebulae and the distant shimmer of uncharted planets, held both a breathtaking beauty and a palpable sense of loneliness.  Each successful trade run, each new system charted, fueled her insatiable thirst for exploration and the thrill of confronting the unknown.
