
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his weary steps, a potent elixir against despair.  The dust of a thousand journeys clung to his worn leather boots, each step a testament to his unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, its vibrant colours painting her bridge in a kaleidoscope of cosmic beauty. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, a perilous voyage through uncharted star systems teeming with undiscovered wonders, and potentially, unimaginable threats.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the loneliness of deep space, the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and avoid rogue gravitational wells, made each jump a gamble. Yet, the boundless expanse of the cosmos, the chance to unveil its secrets, captivated her more than any earthly reward ever could.
