
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseilles, a cacophony of shouting merchants and the salty tang of the sea.  But our destination lay far inland – Constantinople, a fabled city shimmering on the horizon of our ambition. We traded stories with grizzled knights, bartered for supplies in dusty villages, and slept under a canopy of stars, the vastness of the night sky mirroring the immensity of our undertaking.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the East, the promise of untold riches and exotic wonders, spurred us onward.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, our generation starship, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies, a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of nebulae and distant suns.  Our mission: to survey Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Days blurred into weeks in the sterile confines of the ship, punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the camaraderie of our crew.  We dreamt of alien landscapes, of encountering other life forms,  the very thought of it electrifying our hearts even as the vast, empty space between the stars filled us with a sense of both exhilaration and profound loneliness.
