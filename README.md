Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming dully in the afternoon sun, squinted at the horizon, the distant mountains promising both shelter and unknown dangers.  Each day brought a fresh test: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Each jump brought her closer, not just to a destination, but to the answers she sought about humanity's destiny among the stars.
