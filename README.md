
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, empty plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the whispered tales of Ys, a city of unparalleled beauty and magic, fueled her weary spirit. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, danger, and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Krell piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold steel of his starship. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world said to teem with both incredible riches and savage, technologically advanced creatures.  The hyperjump had thrown them into uncharted space, leaving them vulnerable to unforeseen celestial anomalies and pirate attacks.  Yet, the thrill of exploring the galaxy, of pushing the boundaries of known space, surpassed even the inherent risks. The vastness of the cosmos beckoned, promising untold wonders and the ultimate adventure.
