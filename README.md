
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire. Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a worn prayer book, and the hope of reaching the legendary monastery hidden amongst the peaks of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the whispered secrets of the monastery, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unpredictable landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, held its own brand of perilous adventure.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole jumps were constant challenges.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting a course to a future beyond human comprehension, fueled her unwavering courage.
