He'd traded the relative safety of the King's court for the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, a gamble fueled by ambition and the lure of untold riches.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, preparing him for the unknown dangers that lay ahead – bandits, mythical beasts, or the sheer, unforgiving hostility of the wilderness itself.


A thousand light-years from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were astronomical – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters. Yet, the potential rewards, the chance to rewrite the laws of interstellar travel, spurred her onward, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
