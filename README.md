
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through a landscape as unforgiving as it was beautiful – rolling hills giving way to treacherous mountain passes, each shadowed by the threat of bandits or worse.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the long grass, held the potential for adventure – or death. He carried with him not only a sword, but the hope of a people.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden, inexplicable energy surge.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates were merely routine hazards compared to the unknown physics at play within the nebula itself.  The galaxy stretched before her, a tapestry of wonder and danger, where the thrill of discovery was matched only by the constant threat of the void.
