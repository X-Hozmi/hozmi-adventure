
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged through the mud-caked tracks of France.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagons, each strained breath of our tired horses, was a testament to the arduous journey. We'd escaped the plague-ridden city of Avignon, seeking the rumored lost city of Ys, a quest fueled by whispered legends and the glint of potential riches.  Every sunrise brought the chilling uncertainty of bandit ambushes, and every nightfall the gnawing fear of the unknown wilderness.  Our goal, however, burned brighter than the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.

Millennia later, the stars themselves were our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast expanse between galaxies, charting a course to the uncharted Andromeda system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting constant against the alien beauty of nebulae swirling past the viewport. Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a calculated risk in the pursuit of new worlds and undiscovered civilizations.  The dangers were far different than those faced by our medieval predecessors – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of uncharted dangers lurking beyond the veil of known space. But the spirit of exploration, the burning desire to push the boundaries of the known, remained a timeless human constant.
