
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had become far more than a simple religious quest.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispers of a plague stalked the villages. Each sunrise brought fresh dangers, from treacherous terrain to the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every league traversed, their resolve hardened, fueled by faith and a shared thirst for adventure in a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the territorial claims of alien factions, Eva and her crew faced perils far more alien than any medieval knight could imagine.  But the thrill of discovery, the endless expanse of the cosmos, and the knowledge they were pushing the boundaries of human exploration made their perilous journey a thrilling ride into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
