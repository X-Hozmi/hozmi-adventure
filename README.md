
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious, drought-resistant strains she hoped to deliver to a besieged monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse; yet the promise of salvation for starving villagers fueled her onward.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, was a constant companion on her perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was a daily hazard, but the hope of reuniting fragmented families – and uncovering the secrets of Xylos's ancient civilization – propelled him and his crew across the uncharted cosmos.
