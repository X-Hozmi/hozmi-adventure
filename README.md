The rutted track, barely a path through the whispering wheat fields, stretched before him – a ribbon of dust leading towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and rumors of monstrous beasts guarding ancient ruins added to the perils of his quest.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering with suspicious villagers for supplies.  His only companions were his loyal squire, Thomas, and the unwavering glint of hope in his eyes.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirate syndicate tested her skills to the limit.  The vast emptiness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and chilling isolation. Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, and each new system brought the potential for discovery – or destruction. The fate of humanity, she knew, rested on her shoulders and the reliability of her aging starship.
