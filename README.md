
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey across the breadth of Francia.  The biting wind whipped across the plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant bleating of sheep.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed us like a persistent shadow.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of distant markets and whispered tales of legendary cities, propelled us onward. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, a new landscape to conquer, and a deeper appreciation for the resilience of both man and beast.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a far cry from the creak of a wagon wheel.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  The crew, a diverse collection from planets unknown, navigated asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  The thrill remained the same: the challenge of the unknown, the allure of uncharted territories, the shared camaraderie forged in the face of danger.  But now, instead of bandits, we faced the wrath of cosmic anomalies and the silent terror of the void.
