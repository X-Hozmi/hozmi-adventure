
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the Breton countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a vengeful lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold adventure – a bandit ambush, a chance encounter with a wandering monk, or perhaps the discovery of a hidden monastery with ancient secrets.  The journey was perilous, but the possibility of a better future spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  The jump to hyperspace had been a jarring experience, but the breathtaking cosmic vistas held a thrilling allure.  The challenges were immense – treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms. But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, fueled her crew and drove them deeper into the uncharted void.
