
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow sharp in the frigid air.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map – its creases mirroring the lines etched by worry on her face.  This journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria wasn't just a quest for gold, but a desperate attempt to find a cure for her ailing brother, a cure whispered to exist only within the city's ancient ruins.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving elements themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, his knuckles white against the polished chrome.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, tossing the *Stardust Drifter* like a toy in a cosmic storm.  His destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery at the edge of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Rumours of a powerful artifact, capable of bending space and time itself, had drawn him across lightyears of treacherous nebulae and asteroid fields.  The journey wasn't about riches or glory; it was about survival, against the hostile alien landscapes, rival scavengers, and the ever-present threat of the void itself.
