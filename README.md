
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Ahead lies the treacherous Pyrenees mountains, and beyond them, the rumored lands of Iberia, where whispers of lost Moorish treasures and forgotten magic tempt her onward despite the ever-present dangers of bandits, starvation, and disease. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, heightens the thrill of her perilous journey, a gamble for survival and fortune in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth, rumored to harbor unique life forms.  The vastness of space, peppered with the distant shimmer of galaxies, is both breathtaking and terrifying.  Facing the unknown dangers of uncharted space, including unpredictable gravitational anomalies and potentially hostile alien life, Nova presses onward, driven by the insatiable human hunger for exploration and the promise of discovery that lies beyond the stars.
