
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging Europe.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered promise of salvation, and the spirit of adventure burning in their hearts, spurred them onward, their horses' hooves pounding a rhythm against the unforgiving earth.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the crushing loneliness of deep space, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to rewrite the history of humankind, drove them further into the cosmic expanse, their starship a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the galaxy.
