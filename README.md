
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread and a worn map, its ink faded but promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey.  The road ahead was long and arduous, but the promise of adventure burned brighter than the setting sun.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars blurring into streaks of iridescent light as his ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold a planet brimming with untold riches and equally untold dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates were all in a day's work for Rexx and his crew.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held an allure that far surpassed any earthly adventure, a thrilling gamble against the odds in a cosmic game of chance.
