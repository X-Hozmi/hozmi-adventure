
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Elara's small caravan struggled onward.  Dust coated everything, a fine grit clinging to the roughspun wool of her cloak and the sweat-beaded brows of her companions.  Their journey, a perilous trek across the blighted lands to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, was fraught with danger.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling ruins, starvation gnawed at their bellies, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept them ever vigilant.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering glint of hope in their eyes fueled their relentless pursuit of the legendary oasis.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of collapsing stars was a daily challenge.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the known universe.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
