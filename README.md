
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bites at Elias's face as he trudges across the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air. His worn leather boots are caked in mud, his pack heavy with meager supplies.  He's bound for the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril – brigands lurking in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of his endurance, a new hope for reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Wanderer* through a nebula of breathtaking colours, the swirling cosmic dust a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her ship's control panel. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity. The journey across the galaxy is measured not in days, but in years, filled with the hum of the hyperdrive and the silent weight of responsibility.  The dangers are different – unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields, and the unknown entities that might lurk in the vast emptiness of space.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning, fuels her every action.
