
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King.  Each creaking step of the mule was a testament to her unwavering resolve, a symphony against the howling wind and the looming threat of bandits that haunted the mountain passes.  The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the metallic tang of fear, a constant companion on this perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space.  While pirates weren't a concern, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids made every journey a gamble. The twinkling galaxies outside were a breathtaking spectacle, but Rexa knew that the true adventure lay in the unknown possibilities – and potential perils – that awaited them on Kepler-186f.
