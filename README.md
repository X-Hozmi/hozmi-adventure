
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising the legendary Silk Road city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, scorching sun, or treacherous terrain; yet, the lure of exotic spices and untold riches fueled her onward. The whispers of forgotten empires and mythical creatures, heard around crackling campfires, were as compelling as the shimmering promise of the East.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both breathtaking beauty and mortal danger – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown entities lurking in the cosmic dark.  Yet, the chance to discover new life, new worlds, pushed her ever further into the uncharted territories of the galaxy, a modern-day explorer charting the unknown in a different, yet equally perilous, landscape.
