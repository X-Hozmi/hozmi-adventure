
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the sea, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present fear of disease gnawed at the edges of her resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, yet the whisper of Ys's secrets fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Warp drives hummed, alien constellations blazed past the viewport, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks and unpredictable wormholes kept the crew on high alert.  The journey was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of space, but the potential discovery of a lost civilization was a risk worth taking.
