
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, barely legible after weeks of relentless sun and rain, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold a legendary healing balm.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, but the hope of finding the balm, a cure for her ailing brother, fuels her onward. Each creaking wagon wheel, each flash of a distant falcon, each whispered rumour in a village tavern adds to the tapestry of her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, is fraught with peril; unpredictable gravitational currents, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders stalking the interstellar lanes.  The gleaming control panel hums with activity as Jax charts a course through the chaotic cosmic ballet, her crew's lives hanging in the balance.  The promise of a new home, a fresh start amongst the stars, is the beacon guiding them through the uncharted darkness.
