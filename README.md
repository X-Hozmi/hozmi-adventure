The dusty track, barely a path, wound through a landscape of stark beauty – towering mountains clawing at the bruised purple sky, their peaks shrouded in perpetual snow.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.
