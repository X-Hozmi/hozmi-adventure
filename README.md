
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air shimmers with heat, the distant mountains hazy and indistinct.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the constant, gnawing worry of disease. Yet, with every sunrise, the promise of adventure burns brighter—the fabled city of Samarkand, a jewel shimmering on the horizon of our dreams, a reward for enduring the hardships of this arduous, unpredictable journey across a world both beautiful and brutal.

A thousand years hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Starseeker* cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies, the swirling nebulae a breathtaking backdrop to our voyage.  We chase whispers of an ancient, pre-human civilization on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous quest hampered by unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failure. But the allure of discovery, of unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos, fuels our journey, driving us ever onward across the infinite canvas of space.
