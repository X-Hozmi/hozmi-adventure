
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold forgotten magic and unimaginable wealth.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the journey, but the lure of Eldoria, the promise of adventure and perhaps even glory, spurred him on.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of his endurance and courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet capable of sustaining human life.  Navigating nebulae, evading pirate fleets, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were everyday occurrences. The loneliness of space was a constant companion, but the weight of her responsibility, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, fuelled her determination. The journey was fraught with danger, but the potential reward – a new beginning – was worth the risk.
