
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new perils – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the sacred shrine, and the whispered promises of divine grace, fueled their weary steps, pushing them ever closer to their unknown destination.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous gravitational pulls of distant suns was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown – alien lifeforms, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Each jump through hyperspace brought Elara closer to her goal, a gamble against the vast and unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, yet the potential reward – finding her missing kin – made the risk worthwhile.
