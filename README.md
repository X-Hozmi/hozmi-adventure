
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel holding all she possesses.  The journey to the fabled city of Zerzura is perilous – bandits lurk in the shadowed canyons, and the whispering sands hold secrets best left undisturbed.  Yet, the promise of ancient wisdom and untold riches spurs her onward, each creak of her saddle a counterpoint to the rhythmic beat of her determined heart.  The road ahead is long and unforgiving, but Elara's spirit burns brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region teeming with unmapped planets and whispered legends of sentient nebulae.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms are everyday occurrences; the vast emptiness of space is a far cry from the dusty trails of old, but the thrill of discovery – of pushing humanity's boundaries into the unknown – fuels her crew's unwavering resolve. The cosmos awaits.
