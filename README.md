
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to reclaim the lost lands of his family was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience.  The whispered tales of monstrous beasts and enchanted ruins only fueled their determination, their quest a tapestry woven from hardship and the unwavering hope of victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing warp core breaches were all in a day’s work.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both wonder and danger, a thrilling frontier where the unknown beckoned and the rewards, though immense, came at a heavy price.
