
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, her resolve hardened, fueled by faith and the allure of the unknown that lay beyond the next ridge.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand was her only guide, a testament to the bravery and determination needed to conquer the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.   Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, yet the inherent dangers remained – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  But the vastness of space held a siren call, an irresistible invitation to explore the infinite frontiers of the cosmos, and Eva, ever the intrepid explorer, answered its summons.
