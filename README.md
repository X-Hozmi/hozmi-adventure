
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the rutted track, the midday sun beating down mercilessly.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable spring rains, and the whispers of plague stalked their every step. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled their trek, the shared hardship forging a bond stronger than any castle wall.  The promise of reaching their destination, and the stories they would tell upon their return, kept them moving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own unique dangers, unpredictable temporal shifts and the constant threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the mystery of the colony's disappearance, spurred Eva onwards across the galaxy, a modern-day adventurer forging her own legend among the stars.
