
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the dreaded Black Death itself.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred him on, a thirst for adventure outweighing the very real dangers that stalked him across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars, held a different kind of peril – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the constant threat of pirate raiders, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories for humanity, burned bright within her, a beacon guiding her across the cosmic sea.
