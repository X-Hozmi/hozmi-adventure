
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind the creaking wheels of my cart as I traverse the treacherous, sun-baked roads of Provence.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease.  My journey to the Holy Land is fraught with hardship, but the tales whispered in taverns of distant lands, of exotic spices and shimmering silks, fuel my weary steps.  Every mile brings me closer to the unknown, a gamble with fate itself for a glimpse of a world beyond my village.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we pierce the veil of hyperspace.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of the cosmos is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the fragile metal shell of our ship our only defense against the crushing void.  This journey isn't about gold or glory; it's about survival, discovery, and the unrelenting human drive to explore the edges of existence, to plant a flag on a world untouched by our kind.
