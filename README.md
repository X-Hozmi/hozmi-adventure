
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to a potent healing balm.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger of the journey. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, tempered by the ever-present threat of the unknown lurking in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Their adventure was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a test of endurance as much as it was a search for a cure.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic communications array from the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns, Eva relied on her instincts and the unwavering loyalty of her crew. The vastness of space, a terrifying beauty, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense distances separating humanity from its goals. The journey, a breathtaking gamble across the cosmic ocean, promised untold rewards, but carried with it the very real risk of never returning.
