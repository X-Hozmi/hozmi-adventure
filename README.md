
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day was a battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the horizon, making even the familiar landmarks seem alien, testing his courage and resilience with every step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the clutches of space pirates, Eva relied on her wits and advanced technology, facing dangers far removed from the medieval world, yet equally perilous.  The weight of her species rested on her shoulders, a burden far heavier than any bandit or beast.
