
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to me, a constant companion alongside the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in my belly.  My quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, pushed me onward, past crumbling castles and through whispering forests, each sunrise a new challenge and each sunset a precarious respite. The vast, unpredictable landscape was my enemy and my ally, offering both peril and the breathtaking beauty of a world untouched by modern conveniences.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Staring out at the swirling nebulae through the viewport, I felt a kinship with those medieval travelers, the scale of our journeys vastly different yet the spirit of exploration the same.  Each jump to a new star system brought the promise of discovery—new worlds, strange civilizations, unimaginable wonders—but also the potential for unforeseen dangers. The cold, impersonal vastness of space held its own terrors, yet the allure of the unknown, the thirst for knowledge and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of the known, fuelled our relentless journey across the cosmos.
