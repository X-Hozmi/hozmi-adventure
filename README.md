
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the rutted track, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth fills her nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village she left behind. Her journey to the fabled monastery nestled in the Dragon's Tooth mountains is fraught with peril; bandits roam the forests, and the whispers of mythical beasts echo in the shadows. Yet, the hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother fuels her onward, each step a gamble against the harsh realities of a medieval world.


Centuries hence, Captain Jaxx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  He's on a quest for the legendary Aetherium, a substance rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace is a calculated risk, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Strange, beautiful alien worlds dot his trajectory, each with its own unique dangers and wonders.  The galaxy stretches before him, an endless expanse of opportunity and peril, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and relentless pursuit of the stars.
