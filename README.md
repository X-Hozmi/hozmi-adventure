
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she spurred her horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from luxurious; days blurred into a tapestry of muddy tracks, meager meals shared with weary travelers, and nights spent under a sky thick with stars.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every mile, the allure of the holy city fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been a risky one, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Ahead lay the promise of a new colony, a chance to forge a future amongst alien flora and fauna, but also the potential for unforeseen dangers – hostile alien life, equipment malfunctions, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, of charting the uncharted, propelled her forward, a modern-day adventurer searching for new worlds.
