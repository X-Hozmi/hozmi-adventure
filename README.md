
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion. Her pack, heavy with supplies and the weight of her hopes, chafed against her shoulders.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements.  Each step was a gamble, a testament to her courage and unwavering determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Navigating the chaotic gravitational currents required skill honed over years of intergalactic voyages, a constant dance between precision and daring. His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to contain a source of energy capable of revolutionizing galactic travel.  The risks were immense – pirates, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies – but the potential reward outweighed the danger a thousandfold.
