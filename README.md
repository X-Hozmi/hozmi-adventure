
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their kingdom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them on through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying world.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrifying wonders – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of pirates and unknown alien entities.  But the weight of her people's fate rested on her shoulders, driving her across the unfathomable distances between worlds in a desperate race against time.
