
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, was proving far more perilous than expected. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in distrustful villages, and always, the gnawing uncertainty of their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship believed to have vanished near the Andromeda galaxy. The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp drives under pressure, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic anomalies tested the crew's skills and courage to their limits. The search for a lost colony was a drop in the ocean of the cosmos, but for Eva and her crew, it was everything.
