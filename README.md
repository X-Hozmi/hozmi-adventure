
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of the Whisperwood, where whispers of goblins and worse things clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease – yet the unwavering faith in his heart, and the promise of solace at journey's end, spurred him relentlessly onward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her bridge.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Reginald’s era, Eva faced challenges of a different sort: the crushing loneliness of interstellar space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the constant threat of engine failure light-years from any known civilization. The vast unknown beckoned, a tapestry of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, promising both discovery and potential annihilation.
