
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death were less daunting than her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of San Miguel, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential encounter, a brush with the unknown that fueled the thrill and terror of her journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The medieval world was a tapestry of danger and beauty, woven with the threads of hope and desperation.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kerrigan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien life both wondrous and potentially lethal.  Warp drives hummed, stars blazed in a kaleidoscope of colours, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in.  While lacking the immediate physical danger of medieval travel, the existential threat of cosmic anomalies and the lonely isolation of interstellar journeys presented a unique brand of adventure, demanding courage, precision, and an unwavering resolve in the face of the unknown expanses of the galaxy.
