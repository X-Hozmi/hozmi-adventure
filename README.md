The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  But the lure of the mythical Sunstone, hidden deep within the mountain's heart, fueled his relentless journey, a quest for glory and fortune that demanded courage and cunning in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

Yet, the promise of unlocking humanity's galactic destiny, of charting a course to uncharted worlds brimming with wonders and dangers, kept her ship hurtling ever forward, a tiny beacon of hope in the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
