
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the ancient track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the whispered promises of Eldoria, and the desperate hope for survival, spurred them onwards through the unforgiving landscape of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: a survey of the Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien phenomena was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the loneliness of interstellar travel and the gnawing uncertainty of discovering habitable worlds light-years from Earth.  Yet, the vast expanse of space, teeming with unexplored wonders, held an irresistible allure, driving Eva and her crew towards the unknown.
