
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and resolve, fueling his relentless pursuit of the legendary city.

Centuries later, Elara steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of distant stars were all in a day's work for a galactic explorer.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also held perils unimaginable to any medieval traveler, testing Elara’s courage and piloting skills to their limits.
