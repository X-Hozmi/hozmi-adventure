
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown lurking in the vast, uncharted territories.  Each sunrise brought the hope of survival, each sunset the grim reminder of the perilous journey ahead.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara, aboard the starship *Stardust*, navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, her course charted towards the Xylos system. The mission: to establish first contact with a newly discovered sentient species.  The vast distances between planets, the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made this journey as fraught with danger as any medieval expedition. Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of the unknown, fueled their courage and propelled them ever forward.
