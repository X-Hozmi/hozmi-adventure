Her worn leather satchel, containing little more than dried figs and a chipped map, felt heavier than usual.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death were less frightening than the whispers of the Silk Road itself, a siren’s call promising fortune and danger in equal measure. Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk’s cry, punctuated the vast, untamed beauty of her journey – a pilgrimage of trade and survival.

The vast emptiness of space held a terrifying beauty, speckled with vibrant nebulas and the cold, distant gleam of countless stars, a stark contrast to the bustling, chaotic trade hubs they hoped to find at their destination.
