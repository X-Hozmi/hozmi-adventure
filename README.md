
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his journey to the Holy Land.  His quest: a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need to escape the shadow of a past betrayal. The sun dipped low, painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple, a stark reminder of the dangers that still lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship's hull, a reassuring counterpoint to the infinite, star-dusted void surrounding them.  Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, felt the familiar thrill of the unknown mingle with a deep-seated sense of responsibility.  The galaxy held untold wonders, and equally untold dangers – and she, along with her crew, was about to brave them all.
