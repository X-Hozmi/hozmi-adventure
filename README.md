
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Her journey from York to Constantinople is fraught with peril: bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and whispers of the Black Death follow her like a phantom.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager rations in isolated villages.  Yet, the allure of the distant, shimmering spires of the Eastern Empire fuels her relentless stride, a beacon of hope amidst the uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered nebula teeming with unmapped planets, each potentially harboring life, or resources vital to the survival of her colony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien phenomena are commonplace. The loneliness of interstellar travel is a constant companion, but the breathtaking beauty of nebulas and the thrill of discovery outweigh the risks, propelling Ryla and her crew further into the unexplored corners of the cosmos.
