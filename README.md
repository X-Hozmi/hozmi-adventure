
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the cryptic map promising riches – or ruin – in the distant, mythical city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  The adventure was perilous, yet the allure of legend propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy promising a new energy source for a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure trade rights with the enigmatic Kryll Hegemony.  This interstellar voyage wasn't just a quest for energy; it was a gamble for the future of humanity itself, a journey fraught with both cosmic wonders and interstellar intrigue.
