
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned – a few meager coins, a well-thumbed map promising a mythical healing spring, and the memory of her lost family.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the promise of healing, the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f.  The vast expanse of space, peppered with shimmering stars and lurking dangers like asteroid fields and rogue space pirates, was a far cry from the dusty roads of Elara's journey, but the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The call of the unknown, the challenge of the impossible, fueled her and her crew as they ventured into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
