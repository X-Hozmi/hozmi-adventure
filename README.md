
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of a rogue Baron, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease formed a tapestry of hardship woven into the very fabric of his adventure. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each nightfall a precarious rest in a strange and often hostile land.  His only companions were his loyal squire and the unwavering hope for success.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Navigation through asteroid fields, encounters with unknown spacefaring civilizations, and the constant threat of engine failure tested her skills and her courage to the limit.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, became her constant companion,  a stark contrast to the vibrant and diverse worlds she hoped to discover.
