
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret of eternal life.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, fueled by ancient maps and whispered tales, pushed him relentlessly forward, a lone speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship believed to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself and the potential encounters with unknown alien species.  Each jump across the galaxy brought both peril and the thrill of discovery, driving Eva and her crew ever closer to their potentially life-altering objective.
