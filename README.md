
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag, mirroring the grime on her face.  Ahead, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretches under a brutal sun, promising both peril and possibility.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep in the Pyrenees, said to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her aging steed, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present shadow of the plague. Yet, with every mile, her resolve strengthens, fueled by the unwavering hope for a brighter future.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, cuts through the inky black of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity's desperate expansion.  The journey is a relentless dance with hyperspace, fraught with the risk of cosmic anomalies and pirate raids.  But Ryla's crew, a diverse band bound by shared hope and the weight of their mission, pushes onward.  The vastness of space is a daunting challenge, but the promise of a new beginning, a new home, propels them towards the unknown.
