
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend promising untold riches and a path to forgotten magic.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the very ground seemed to whisper tales of ancient curses. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill, transforming the simple journey into a desperate race against time and the myriad dangers of the medieval world.  Survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in years, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the quiet camaraderie of her crew.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions lurking in the black between stars, and the ever-present threat of system failures – these were the perils of interstellar travel. The promise of a new beginning, however, fuelled their relentless drive across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
