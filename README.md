
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the endless expanse of desert tested their endurance to the breaking point.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in desolate villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of both friend and foe.  The whispered legends of Zerzura fueled their resolve, but the harsh reality of the road continually threatened to extinguish their hope.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', her ship a speck of defiance against the colossal canvas of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a harrowing odyssey.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic spatial distortions, pirate raids were a constant threat, and the vastness of space itself instilled a profound sense of isolation.  Elara, however, was undeterred.  The potential reward – unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel – outweighed the unimaginable risks, propelling her and her crew ever further into the cosmic unknown.
