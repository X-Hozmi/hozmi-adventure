
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery holding the lost scroll of Aerilon, pushed her onward despite the treacherous terrain and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The vastness of the unknown land, speckled with crumbling castles and hidden villages, fueled her spirit of adventure, a stark contrast to the comfort of her noble upbringing.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored nebula known as the Crimson Veil.  The ship shuddered slightly as it exited warp, revealing a breathtaking vista of swirling gas and nascent star systems.   While the dangers weren't bandits or starvation,  the risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms or navigational errors in the uncharted territory presented a formidable challenge – one that spurred Ryla's insatiable thirst for exploration among the cosmos.
