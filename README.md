
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creaking cart wheel and distant hawk cry marked another mile on her perilous journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, a quest for a cure her ailing brother desperately needed.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the unwavering glint in her eye betrayed the fierce determination burning within.  Every sunrise brought renewed purpose to her epic adventure, fueled by familial love and unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding in time with the ship's hyperdrive.  A seasoned explorer charting unmapped galaxies, she wasn't driven by a desperate need, but by an insatiable thirst for discovery.  Each jump to warp speed brought her closer to the legendary Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbour life unlike any seen before.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all in a day's work for Nova; the endless expanse of space, teeming with wonders and dangers alike, was her playground.
