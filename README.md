
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the rugged terrain of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered promise of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague-ravaged lands, spurred her onward, each hardship a step closer to her goal.  The road stretched before her, an endless tapestry of hope and fear woven together.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the hyperdrive sputtering as they emerged from a wormhole near the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth. Navigating the treacherous currents of spacetime, dodging asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravity wells of neutron stars, was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth.  But the fate of millions rested on his shoulders, a far greater burden than any galactic storm.
