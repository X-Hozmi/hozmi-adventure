His journey across the ravaged lands of France had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease.

The vast, unforgiving cosmos held its own unique dangers, yet the promise of interstellar cooperation fueled her unwavering determination.
