
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her chapped lips.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed her journey.  Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, a burning ember in her heart stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held its own brand of adventure, a far cry from the medieval trails but equally perilous.  The promise of discovering new life, new civilizations, and charting uncharted territories fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
