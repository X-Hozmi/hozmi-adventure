
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Each craggy peak held the promise of both breathtaking vista and deadly ambush.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey from the bustling port city of Marseille to the fabled silk roads of the East.  The weight of her satchel, containing the family's last remaining heirlooms, felt as heavy as the burden of her quest: to reach her betrothed before winter sealed the passes.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet with signs of nascent civilization, was risky, even with the advanced warp drive.  Cosmic radiation, pirate attacks from the Kryll Syndicate, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel were just a few of the hazards he faced.  The successful delivery of the vital terraforming equipment hinged not just on his piloting skills, but on outsmarting the dangers that lurked in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
