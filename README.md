
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a seed – a rumored cure for the creeping blight that threatened her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse. Yet, the desperate hope in her heart fueled her onward, a burning ember against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of salvation pushed her ever closer to her destination, a distant monastery whispered to hold the key to her people's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, his starship a tiny speck against the swirling nebula of Xylos.  He wasn't searching for a cure, but for a lost colony, swallowed by the unforgiving expanse of the galactic void.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  Asteroids the size of moons lurked in the darkness, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders added another layer of peril to his already hazardous mission. But Rexx, driven by the dwindling hope of finding survivors, pressed on, a lone beacon against the inky blackness of space.
