
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traverse the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead, the promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast, unforgiving desert, fuels my weary limbs.  Each creak of my packhorse's saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, holds the potential for both bounty and peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant shadows.  The journey is arduous, but the whispers of lost treasures and ancient knowledge drive me onward.

Centuries hence, the hum of the hyperdrive is my lullaby as my starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravity wells of rogue planets is a daily challenge, but the breathtaking views of nebulae painted across the inky blackness are a reward in themselves.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace. The cosmos holds its breath, awaiting my arrival.
