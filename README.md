
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a daunting barrier between her and the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and dwindling supplies are constant threats, yet the whispers of Eldoria's lost magic fuel her onward.  Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of hope, mixed with the chilling uncertainty of what dangers the day may hold.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerian pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f.  The journey is fraught with peril - pirate attacks are commonplace, and navigating the unstable wormholes between galaxies demands nerves of steel and precise calculations.  The vast, alien landscapes glimpsed through the cockpit window, teeming with unimaginable lifeforms, are a constant reminder of the boundless wonders – and terrors – of the cosmos.
