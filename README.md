
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its faded ink promising riches in the distant city of Samarkand – silks, spices, and perhaps even a glimpse of the mythical Sunstone. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the price for adventure, a price Thomas was willing to pay for the glory and fortune that awaited him beyond the horizon. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, transforming the journey from simple travel into a thrilling pursuit of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a stark contrast to the medieval traveler's landscape, but the thrill of discovery remained the same.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien technology were the modern-day equivalent of bandits and treacherous mountains, each challenge adding to the epic scale of her interstellar voyage.
