
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone Monastery, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or disaster.  Survival depended on her wit, her courage, and the kindness of strangers encountered along the unforgiving road.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien life – some friendly, some decidedly not.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became commonplace as he jumped between solar systems, the vast expanse of the galaxy stretching endlessly before him. The thrill of discovery mingled with the ever-present danger of encountering the unknown, a constant reminder that even amongst the stars, adventure carries a hefty price.
