
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary horse as he traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Ys, and the desperate hope it represents, drives him onward, a lone knight against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, crucial to the survival of her dying colony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable forces of hyperspace are all part of her routine. The vastness of the cosmos, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly dangerous, is a constant companion on her perilous journey across the galaxy.
