
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, beckon her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, speaks of unseen dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of discovery, the whisper of adventure, fuels her journey across this unforgiving landscape.  She is not merely traveling; she is chasing a legend, a dream etched in the very fabric of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rourke pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula swirling with cosmic dust and the ghosts of dying suns.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across a thousand galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Hegemony, Rexx and his crew face perils far exceeding any medieval knight's nightmare.  The vastness of space, filled with both wonder and unimaginable danger, tests their courage and skill with every jump across the light-years, as they chase a future forged in the heart of the cosmos.
