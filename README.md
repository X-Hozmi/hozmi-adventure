Her worn leather satchel holds a king's ransom – not in gold, but in seeds of rare spices, vital to her family's survival.  Bandits, scorching sun, and treacherous terrain are constant threats, but the promise of a new life in the distant markets of Constantinople fuels her onward.  Each sunset paints the sky in hues reflecting both her hope and the ever-present danger lurking just beyond the flickering campfire.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured in light years and fraught with the perils of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unknown.  The vastness of space is a lonely, beautiful expanse, but the thought of reuniting with the lost colonists—or perhaps discovering a new civilization—keeps her engines humming, a beacon against the infinite darkness.
