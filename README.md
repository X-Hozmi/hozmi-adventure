
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but a scroll promising a hidden monastery said to hold ancient healing secrets.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the hope of finding the monastery, the promise of fulfilling her dying mother's wish, spurs her onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the crimson nebula, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a lullaby against the backdrop of cosmic silence.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp storm.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  They face not just the dangers of hostile alien lifeforms and crumbling space stations, but the psychological toll of isolation and the constant threat of equipment failure in the vast emptiness between worlds.  The weight of their mission, the fate of a lost civilization, rests heavily on his shoulders.
