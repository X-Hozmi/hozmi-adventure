
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a map, its creases mirroring the wrinkles etched onto her face – a map promising a lost city rumored to hold untold riches, but also whispering of treacherous bandits and unforgiving terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for adventure, for peril, and for the discovery of something truly extraordinary.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her cockpit.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets lurking in the shadows.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of adventure, one measured not in miles but in light-years, where the greatest treasures weren't gold and jewels, but knowledge and the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos itself.
