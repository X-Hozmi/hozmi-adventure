
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a half-eaten loaf.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death were less frightening than the unknown that lay ahead: the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, fueled her determination – a perilous adventure woven into the tapestry of a desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold steel of his starship.  His mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey requiring months of hyperspace travel and navigation through treacherous asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, though breathtaking, held its own terrors – pirates, cosmic anomalies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, all part of the galactic frontier's relentless allure.
