
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of York, a knapsack heavy with meager supplies slung across my shoulders. The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clings to my clothes as I join a meandering caravan heading south.  Each sunrise paints the vast English countryside in different hues, revealing rolling hills, dense forests guarded by ancient oaks, and the occasional flash of a river winding its way towards an unknown destination.  We face bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the spirit of adventure, the thirst for the unknown, fuels our weary steps.  The promise of distant lands and perhaps, a fortune, keeps us moving.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness, propelled by a fusion drive that hums a lullaby of interstellar travel.  Each jump takes us across light years, revealing nebulae painted across the cosmos in breathtaking colours and alien planets bathed in the light of suns both familiar and bizarre.  We trade stories with spacefaring nomads, barter exotic minerals, and explore worlds that teem with strange and wonderful life. The risk of encountering hostile alien life or system malfunctions is ever-present, but the endless wonder of the galaxy far outweighs any peril.
