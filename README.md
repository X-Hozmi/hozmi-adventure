
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  He carried a king's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, a journey fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of a new hardship, but also the unwavering hope of reaching his destination and fulfilling his sworn duty.  The road stretched ahead, a ribbon of uncertainty across the vast, unpredictable face of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with cosmic hazards.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue black holes, and repairing vital systems in zero-gravity were all part of a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space, the hypnotic pull of distant galaxies, and the constant hum of the ship's engines filled her with a sense of awe and the pressing urgency of her task – to find a lost civilization and bring them home.
