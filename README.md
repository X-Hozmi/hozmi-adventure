
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his weary steed onward, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the encroaching famine.  Days blurred into weeks, filled with perilous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant threat of wild beasts. Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure and the unforgiving vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital enzyme from the Kepler-186f colony, a life-saving substance for a ravaged Earth.  Warp jumps flung her across galaxies, each a gamble against unforeseen celestial anomalies and the lurking threat of pirate vessels.  The endless expanse of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also a terrifying solitude, a reminder of the immense distances and the fragile nature of life in the vast, unforgiving cosmos.
