
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The journey across the unforgiving French countryside was proving more treacherous than any battlefield.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing their courage and resolve as they pressed towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold unimaginable riches and power.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with dangers unseen by human eyes.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling fuel were all in a day’s work.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragile nature of life against the backdrop of cosmic indifference.
