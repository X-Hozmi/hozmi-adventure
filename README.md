
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across Europe, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a new vista unfolded, each hardship faced strengthened her resolve, fueling the adventure that had become her life.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigation charts pulsed with nebulae and wormhole signatures, a far cry from medieval maps.  Her crew, a polyglot of human and alien species, prepared for a perilous landing on Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar unity.  The risks were different – hostile alien life, malfunctioning hyperdrives, the crushing loneliness of space – but the thirst for discovery burned just as bright, echoing the adventurous spirit of those who had traversed medieval lands centuries before.
