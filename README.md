
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, disease stalked the travelers, and the very landscape, treacherous and unforgiving, threatened to swallow him whole.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and courage, forging him in the crucible of the medieval world.  The shimmering promise of the East fueled his tireless steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and lurking black holes, presented a far different, yet equally daunting, challenge than Thomas faced.  The danger wasn't just physical; it was the loneliness of infinite space, the constant threat of system failures, and the unknown lurking just beyond the reach of her sensors.  The hope of a new beginning drove her across the cosmic sea.
