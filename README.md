
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secret to a potent healing balm for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely inconveniences in his desperate journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast distance still ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, the *Hope's End*, believed to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies were all in a day's work for Elara.  The vast emptiness of interstellar space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable potential, a thrilling and perilous gamble for a future free from the limitations of Earth.
