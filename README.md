
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered rumors, guides her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step forward is a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  The biting wind carries the scent of pine and fear, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead, yet the hope of salvation fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter'. His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hyperspace jump was turbulent, leaving his crew shaken but undeterred.  Before them lies the unknown, a tapestry of uncharted planets and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Despite the advanced technology at their fingertips, the vastness of space remains a daunting and unpredictable frontier, testing their courage and ingenuity with each passing light-year.
