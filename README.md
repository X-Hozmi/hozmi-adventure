
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with the weight of her quest – a legendary healing herb rumored to grow only on the windswept peaks.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness.  Wolves howled in the distance, bandits were whispered to infest the lower valleys, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of her determination.  But the hope of success fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula, her destination a newly discovered planet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vista of cosmic dust and distant galaxies.  This wasn't a journey for herbs or glory, but for the survival of humanity itself.  The alien world held the promise of new resources, vital to a dwindling Earth, but also an unknown and potentially lethal environment.  Eva gripped the controls, her knuckles white, her gaze fixed on the navigation console – the fate of her crew, and perhaps humanity, rested on her shoulders.
