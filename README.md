Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, and a new breathtaking vista to reward her perseverance. The rough-hewn path was her lifeline, leading her through vibrant marketplaces and desolate wastelands, a testament to the unpredictable beauty and unforgiving nature of medieval travel.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vast distances between galaxies still demanded meticulous planning and unwavering courage.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for navigational errors, pirate attacks, or encounters with the uncharted wonders – and horrors – of the cosmos.  Her mission, a diplomatic voyage to the Andromeda galaxy, was as much a test of technological prowess as it was a testament to humanity's relentless curiosity and thirst for exploration across the unimaginable expanse of the universe.
