
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the scarred plains of France as Jean, a young cartographer fleeing the Black Death, sets out on his perilous journey east.  His worn map, a patchwork of rumour and half-remembered tales, guides him towards the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of disease, yet the lure of salvation keeps his weary feet moving across the dusty tracks and through dense, unfamiliar forests.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from our own.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare element vital to sustaining life on a dying Kepler-186f. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Elara and her crew face their own kind of plague - the relentless decay of their ship's systems and the ever-present threat of interdimensional rifts that could tear their vessel apart.  The journey is not just across space, but a test of courage, ingenuity, and the strength of the human spirit against overwhelming odds.
