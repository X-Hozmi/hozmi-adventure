
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the relentless journey across the rugged Breton countryside.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered around crackling fires – tales of daring knights, plundered castles, and the mythical lands beyond the western sea.  Every creak of the saddle, every flash of steel from a passing mercenary band, fueled the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder that survival, and perhaps fortune, lay hidden just beyond the next crest.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we hurtled across the Andromeda galaxy.  Unlike the familiar uncertainties of medieval travel, the vastness of interstellar space held a different kind of fear, the cold, indifferent expanse punctuated only by the shimmering constellations and the faint, distant glow of nebulae.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to humanity's survival.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, the potential rewards - or catastrophic failures - equally immense.
