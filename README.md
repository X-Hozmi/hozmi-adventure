
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her small caravan, laden with silks and spices destined for the far-off kingdom of Eldoria, is a fragile thread against the vast, untamed landscape.  Bandits lurk in the shadows, storms threaten to unleash their fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts echo through the valleys.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset the desperate hope of survival and the tantalizing promise of riches beyond imagining.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes pilots the starship *Stardust* through a nebula painted in hues of amethyst and emerald. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, is a lonely expanse, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present threat of unforeseen celestial events.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and battling the monotony of interstellar travel are daily hurdles in Ava's quest for discovery, a quest fueled by the hope of finding a new home among the stars, a new chapter for humanity.
