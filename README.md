
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance.  They’d skirted bandit encampments, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and braved the wrath of sudden storms.  Each sunrise brought new challenges:  the constant threat of starvation, the ever-present risk of ambush, and the gnawing uncertainty of their destination. Yet, the whispered promise of divine healing fueled their weary steps, pushing them further into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, offered both exhilarating freedom and the crushing weight of isolation.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, each star a potential beacon of hope or a harbinger of disaster. The fate of a colony rested on her shoulders, a weight far heavier than any earthly burden.
