
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his weary mule.  Ahead lies the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse.  His quest, to reach the distant city of Prague to deliver a vital message to the King, is fraught with peril.  Bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalk him, but the weight of his responsibility and the glint of promised reward keep him moving forward, one precarious step at a time.  He dreams of the cobbled streets and warm hearths of the city, a stark contrast to the harsh reality of his journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet within the swirling nebula of Xylos.   The journey is a lonely one, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the occasional burst of static from distant, unknown signals.   Navigation through asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps are routine, but the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life or encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies keeps her alert and ever vigilant. The promise of discovery, and perhaps even a new home for humanity, fuels her tireless exploration.
