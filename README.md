Sir Kaelan, his armor dulled with dust and sweat, squinted at the horizon.  Months he had journeyed, following whispers of a lost city rumored to hold unimaginable power.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and scorching deserts had tested his mettle and his men, but the lure of adventure, the chance to etch his name in legend, pushed them onward.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset a deeper understanding of the vastness and peril of the world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', her knuckles white.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport was a breathtaking spectacle, yet a stark reminder of the immense distances separating humanity from its new home among the stars.  Faster-than-light travel had opened galaxies to exploration, but the journey was never without risk; rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each voyage a gamble. Yet, for Eva, the thrill of charting unknown systems, of discovering new worlds and alien civilizations, outweighed every danger.
