
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a precarious mission that required her to deliver a vital message to the distant monastery of San Juan de la Peña nestled high in the Pyrenees. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions on this perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  The allure of the unknown, however, fueled her onward, a heady mix of fear and purpose pushing her deeper into the heart of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the isolation and the sheer scale of the cosmos were a constant reminder of the perilous nature of her quest, a quest driven by the insatiable human desire to explore the universe and uncover its mysteries.
