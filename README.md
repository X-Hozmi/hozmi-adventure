
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the sun-baked plains, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered of in hushed tones at taverns and around crackling campfires.  He'd braved bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and scorching deserts, all fueled by a desperate hope to find the legendary healing waters said to restore his ailing brother.  Each creak of his saddle, each beat of his horse's tired hooves, was a step closer to either salvation or a grim, nameless grave.

Centuries hence, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver tear against the backdrop of a swirling nebula.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region teeming with unmapped planets and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a rhythmic pulse against the vast, silent expanse of space. Each jump to a new star system was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown – a quest for knowledge and discovery far beyond the reach of any medieval knight, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.
