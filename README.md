
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zamora, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the slow, agonizing death she was desperately trying to outrun.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unmapped wormholes and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of countless stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Success meant unlocking intergalactic trade and exploration; failure meant oblivion.  The vastness of the cosmos, however, was a far cry from the limited world Elara had known.
