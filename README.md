
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange. His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, forging a path not just across the land, but through the very fabric of his own spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  The shimmering tapestry of galaxies stretched before her, each a potential destination, each holding both wonder and peril.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos Prime, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Faster-than-light travel meant bridging vast distances in the blink of an eye, but navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient star charts proved to be equally challenging.  The galaxy itself was a vast, unforgiving wilderness, demanding bravery, skill, and unwavering hope.
