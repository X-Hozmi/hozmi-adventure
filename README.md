
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land were ever present.  Her adventure was a race against time and fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to possess a singularity capable of altering the very fabric of spacetime.  The journey, measured not in days but in years, was a constant vigil against meteor showers, hyper-jumps gone awry, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – beings as alien and unpredictable as the cosmos themselves.  The prize, however, was a gamble worth taking – the potential to rewrite the future of humanity.
