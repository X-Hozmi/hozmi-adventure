
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains did little to deter her. She was bound for the fabled city of Compostela, a pilgrimage fueled not by piety but by a desperate search for a lost family heirloom – a jeweled dagger said to hold the key to untold riches. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the promise of adventure, danger, and perhaps, ultimate reward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigation through the swirling nebulae was perilous, a constant dance with gravity wells and rogue asteroids.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from a planet orbiting a binary sun, a resource crucial to sustaining life on her overcrowded home world.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the same intoxicating allure as any medieval battlefield – the thrill of exploration tempered by the ever-present risk of the unknown.
