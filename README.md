
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small company pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the possibility of salvation, spurred them on, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by ancient alien glyphs and a gut feeling honed by years of galactic exploration. The mission: to locate a missing colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps took them across unimaginable distances, the ship buffeted by cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of rediscovering lost kin fueled their journey, a testament to humanity's boundless reach amongst the cosmos.
