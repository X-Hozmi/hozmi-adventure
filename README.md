
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, each nightfall a gamble with survival against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Yet, the whispered tales of Jerusalem, the yearning for redemption, fueled his relentless journey across a continent teeming with both beauty and brutality.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though far faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less fraught with danger.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space tested her and her crew to their limits.  Yet, the promise of a new beginning, the hope of forging a future among the stars, drove them across the vast expanse of the galaxy, their ship a tiny speck of defiance against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.
