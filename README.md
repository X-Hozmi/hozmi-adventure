
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions crossed the unforgiving plains of Aragon.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled unpredictably, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, a struggle against the elements and the uncertainties of a world largely unknown beyond their village.  But the promise of the holy city, and the shared camaraderie forged in hardship, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst swirling cosmic dust and the potential hazards of unmapped wormholes.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, Rexx faced a different kind of peril: the isolation of deep space, the constant threat of equipment failure, and the ever-present mystery of the unknown, waiting in the dark expanse beyond their ship's lights.
