
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a warning of impending war.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild animals, or worse.  The vast, unpredictable landscape stretched before her, a tapestry woven with danger and the faint glimmer of hope that her journey would make a difference.  The sun beat down mercilessly, a constant companion to the gnawing hunger in her belly and the ever-present fear that shadowed her steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr space pirates was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape back on Earth.  Yet, the breathtaking panorama of galaxies unfolding around her, the sheer scale of the cosmos, fueled her determination.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, promising both untold peril and unimaginable wonders.
