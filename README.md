
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and wonder.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, while whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten cities fueled her journey.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offered the lure of respite, but the lure of the unknown, of the fabled Silk Road's distant end, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields between Kepler-186f and its moon, Ryla piloted with nerves of steel, her crew reliant on her expertise to reach the fabled Xylos system.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the breathtaking nebulae swirling past their viewport, were a far cry from the medieval landscape, yet the thrill of exploration, the facing of unknown dangers, remained a constant, a timeless echo resonating through the ages.
