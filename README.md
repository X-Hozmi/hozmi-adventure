
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – yet the fierce determination in her heart burned brighter than any threat.  The road ahead was long and perilous, but the hope of salvation fueled her every step.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets capable of sustaining humanity's expanding population.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of distant stars, instilled a profound sense of awe and isolation.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human understanding, outweighed any fear.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a mystery waiting to be unveiled.
