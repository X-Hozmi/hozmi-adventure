
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of salvation, whispered on the wind, propelled them forward, a testament to the enduring human spirit facing the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, *Stardust*, through a nebula of incandescent gases, the swirling colors a hypnotic distraction from the immense challenge ahead.  Their mission: to colonize Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, a gamble for humanity’s future.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the potential for alien encounters – these were the new perils, as daunting as any faced by medieval knights. But the promise of a new dawn, a new world, fueled their daring expedition.
