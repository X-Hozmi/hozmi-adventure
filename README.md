Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked their every step.  Each sunrise brought the promise of breathtaking vistas – rolling hills bathed in golden sunlight, towering castles silhouetted against a bruised twilight sky – but also the constant threat of the unknown, a stark reminder of their vulnerability in a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of encountering rogue space pirates added an edge of thrilling danger to the intergalactic voyage, a far cry from the simpler perils of medieval travel but no less compelling in its challenge.
