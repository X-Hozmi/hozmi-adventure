
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of the Mongol Empire in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold ancient healing secrets, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and the biting wind threatened to steal the warmth from her bones.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the monastery’s power a beacon in the harsh reality of her arduous trek.


Millennia later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony ship believed to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of space pirates, Ava and her crew faced unimaginable challenges.  The vastness of space, a beautiful tapestry of celestial wonders, was also a lonely and unforgiving expanse.  But the hope of discovering a new era of interstellar exploration, and perhaps finding the lost colonists, pushed them ever closer to their destination, a distant glimmer of light years away.
