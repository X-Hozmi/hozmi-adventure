
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only respite the occasional shade offered by gnarled olive trees.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of eternal life.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the perilous journey, propelled him forward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite canvas of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant battle against the elements, but the promise of discovery, of unveiling the secrets of a new world, spurred her on.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a beauty and mystery that ignited her soul, a stark contrast to the familiar confines of Earth.
