
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  The whispers of a lost city, shimmering with forgotten magic, had lured her from her village, a siren song promising untold riches and adventure.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small prices to pay for the chance to uncover the secrets of the ancients, secrets hidden for centuries beneath the unforgiving earth.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to press onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his ship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian flora to the galactic capital, a journey fraught with peril.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadows, temporal anomalies threatened to unravel the very fabric of spacetime, and the ever-present threat of fuel depletion loomed large.  Yet, for Razor, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos and the thrill of navigating its treacherous currents far outweighed the risks, making each hyperspace jump a gamble he was more than willing to take.
