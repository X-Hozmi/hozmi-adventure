
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunken City of Ys, had already claimed two men to sickness and exhaustion.  Each creak of their worn wagons, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the promise of bandits or worse.  The map, a faded parchment promising untold riches and ancient secrets, was their only guide through the treacherous, ever-shifting landscape, a constant reminder of the perils and the allure of the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the guide. Captain Elara, at the helm of the 'Stardust Drifter', navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, a shimmering kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars. Their mission: to retrieve a rare element vital for sustaining life on New Eden, a colony teetering on the brink of collapse.  The dangers were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels – but the thrill of exploration, the yearning for discovery, remained a timeless human constant, echoing across the centuries from medieval plains to interstellar void.
