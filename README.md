
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the weather threatened to turn foul, and the very ground beneath their horses' hooves seemed to whisper tales of ancient evils. Yet, the glint of distant spires, the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, and the unwavering faith in their hearts fueled their onward progress.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new chapter in their adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen reserves, Eva faced challenges far removed from the medieval knight's, yet equally perilous. The vast expanse of space, teeming with wonder and danger, was her canvas, and the cosmos itself, her stage.
