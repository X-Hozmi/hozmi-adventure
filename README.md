
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey to the Holy Land felt endless; each day a battle against fatigue, hunger, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  He’d traded tales with grizzled pilgrims and boisterous merchants along the way, each encounter a fleeting glimpse into a world far larger than his small village. The promise of Jerusalem, however distant, fuelled his determination to push on, despite the hardships of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of the galaxy never ceased to awe her.  This mission, a survey of newly-discovered planets, meant months away from home, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and charting unknown systems.  The thrill of discovery outweighed the loneliness of deep space, a stark contrast to the medieval traveler's struggles, yet both shared a profound sense of adventure in pushing beyond known horizons.
