
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, pressed onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to leave him stranded and starving. Yet, with each creak of his saddle and each sunrise painting the rolling hills gold, the thrill of the unknown fueled his weary steps.  The vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval England held its own unique magic; a tapestry woven with danger and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The cosmos was a breathtaking, terrifying expanse;  the risk of encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien life was ever-present.  But the promise of discovery, of mapping uncharted territories among the stars, was a siren song that drew her ever deeper into the inky black.  The vastness of space offered a freedom unlike any terrestrial adventure, a chance to unravel the greatest mysteries of the universe.
