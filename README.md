
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger in her belly. Yet, the promise of Zerzura, and the unwavering love for her brother, spurred her onward, a tiny speck against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet struggling to survive against the harsh elements.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and managing the delicate balance of her ship's life support were mere inconveniences compared to the immense loneliness of interstellar travel, the endless expanse of space a constant reminder of humanity's fragile grip on the galaxy.
