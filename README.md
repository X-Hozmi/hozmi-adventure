
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, each hardship forging her into a tougher, more resolute woman.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of adventure, danger, and perhaps, glory.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a perilous task fraught with the dangers of space pirates and unpredictable gravitational fields.  The vast, alien landscapes that unfolded before her – swirling crimson storms on Kepler-186f, the bioluminescent oceans of Gliese 581g – were breathtaking yet unforgiving.  Each jump to hyperspace represented a leap into the unknown, a gamble with fate in the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
