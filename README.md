
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows, wolves howled in the distance, and the whispered rumors of a monstrous beast guarding a hidden pass sent shivers down her spine.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous rivers, bartering for supplies in questionable villages, and constantly being vigilant against those who would exploit a lone traveler. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold ancient magic, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her home. Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula were all in a day's work for a seasoned intergalactic freighter captain. The thought of the hefty reward, and the knowledge she was pushing the boundaries of known space, fueled her resolve amidst the vast, unforgiving emptiness of the cosmos.
