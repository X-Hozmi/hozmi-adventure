
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered rumors, guides her towards the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day is a gamble – bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threaten to swallow her whole, and the biting wind whispers tales of mythical beasts guarding ancient secrets.  Survival itself is an adventure, a constant test of wit, courage, and endurance against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across uncharted star systems filled with gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Advanced technology mitigates some of the dangers, but the vast, unknowable expanse of space remains a formidable opponent. Each jump through hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos, and the thrill of discovery and the weight of responsibility intertwine to make every moment an unforgettable adventure.
