
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried bread, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  She journeyed to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with peril; bandits roamed freely, and the whispers of the Black Death followed her like a shadow. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpened her senses, transforming every mile into a test of courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been brutal, pushing the ship's aging engines to their limits.  His mission: to locate a rumored colony of lost terraformers.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent hum of the ship's engines and the occasional crackle of static, offered a different kind of danger – the unknown, the unpredictable, a loneliness that chilled more deeply than any medieval winter.
