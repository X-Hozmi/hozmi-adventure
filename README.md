
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like the teeth of some monstrous beast.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh surge of adrenaline – the thrill of the unknown a potent antidote to the gnawing fear of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of the plague.  She journeyed not for riches, but for knowledge, seeking the lost monastery whispered to hold the secrets of ancient healing.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* pierced the veil of a nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking distraction from the critical jump calculations.  Navigating the treacherous wormhole to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a gamble, but the potential reward – interstellar peace – outweighed the risks.  Her crew, a motley band from across the galaxy, relied on her unwavering resolve as the ship bucked against the gravitational tides, their collective breath held until the destination shimmered into view, a jewel in the inky black.
