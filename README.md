
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour clanking, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had become a desperate race against the encroaching Black Death.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs claiming unwary travelers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, Reginald pressed on, driven by faith and the hope of reaching sanctuary before the plague claimed him too.  The open road was a tapestry woven with hardship, beauty, and the raw, unpredictable force of nature.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking panorama of nebulas and distant galaxies, held both wonder and peril.  Warp jumps were unpredictable, pirate attacks a constant threat, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel tested the crew’s resolve.  But the promise of finding the lost colonists, and perhaps uncovering a new source of vital energy, fuelled their journey across the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
