Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to harbor brigands and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, seeking a cure for his ailing sister.

Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and battling the ever-present threat of solar flares were all in a day's work for a galactic explorer, a testament to human ambition in the far-flung reaches of the cosmos.
