
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispering sands held secrets best left undisturbed.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fueled her relentless pursuit.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the spectacle of a thousand dying stars.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp jump centuries ago.  Each jump across the void was a gamble, the risk of encountering space pirates or encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies ever-present.  But the hope of finding her ancestors, the thrill of charting unexplored space, and the chance to unravel the mysteries of Aethel's disappearance were rewards worth risking everything for.
