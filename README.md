
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her homespun tunic. Her journey to Avignon was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each creak of her saddle and rise of the sun, a fierce determination burned within her – to reach the papal court and plead her family's case, a quest as perilous as any knight's crusade.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of a dying star painting the viewport in vibrant hues.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were all in a day's work for Rexa.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held the promise of discovery, or perhaps, utter annihilation.
