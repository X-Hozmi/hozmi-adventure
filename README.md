
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted with delivering a rare healing herb to a distant monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – and danger. Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of the cosmic dust clouds painted a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of unknown space anomalies and potentially hostile alien life.  The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of challenge – the isolation, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the weight of responsibility for the crew under her command.
