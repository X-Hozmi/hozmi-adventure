
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Each creak of her saddle leather was a counterpoint to the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves, a soundtrack to her perilous journey.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease clung to the air like a shroud, and the endless expanse of rolling hills held both the promise of a distant kingdom and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  Her quest, a sacred relic hidden within a crumbling monastery, propelled her onward, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and fading hope.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump drive hummed, a low thrum vibrating through the ship's hull as they traversed the vast gulf between galaxies.  Ahead lay the unexplored Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced not marauding knights, but the chilling emptiness of space, the unpredictable anomalies of hyperspace, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on unsuspecting vessels venturing into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
