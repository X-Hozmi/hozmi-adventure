
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her meager pack held little more than dried bread, a waterskin, and the worn map promising a hidden monastery said to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger, but the hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a tiny ember against the vast, indifferent night.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure the rare Xylos crystals needed to power her aging vessel.  The journey was fraught with danger – pirate raids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of void storms – but the promise of untold riches, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories, spurred her crew onward, a band of intrepid explorers against the infinite, glittering darkness.
