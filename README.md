
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the crisp autumn air.  Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions – a map stained with rain, a worn compass, and the letter from her brother, urging her return to the family estate.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were daily companions on her journey across the splintered kingdoms, a perilous adventure fueled by familial love and stubborn determination.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raiders was a commonplace hazard, but the vast distances and unpredictable cosmic phenomena always presented a thrilling – and terrifying – gamble.   The thrill of exploration burned brighter than any fear, however, the promise of discovering new worlds and forging a new future for humanity a powerful motivator in the endless expanse of the cosmos.
