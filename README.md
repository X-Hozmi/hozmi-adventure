
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  But the whispers of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving terrain of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum as it leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route with the Xylos system, a perilous undertaking involving navigating treacherous asteroid fields, avoiding the predatory K'tharr warships, and negotiating with the enigmatic Xylossian civilization.  The cosmos offered breathtaking beauty, but also held dangers beyond human comprehension, a testament to the daunting, yet exhilarating, nature of interstellar travel.
