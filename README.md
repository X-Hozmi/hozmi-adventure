
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley collection of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-caked tracks of the Rhineland.  Each creak of our packhorses was a symphony of hardship and hope, the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria spurring us onward despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits. We navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and traded whispered stories around flickering campfires under the vast, indifferent gaze of the stars.  The path was arduous, but the quest, the unknown, fueled our every step.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova, her face grim with the responsibility of a thousand souls, guided her vessel through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The mission: to retrieve the lost colony ship, the *Hope*.  Each jump across hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown expanse where rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes lurked.  But the potential of discovering new life, of charting a course into unmapped territories of the cosmos, outweighed the dangers – a similar fire, though fueled by technology instead of legend, driving them relentlessly onward.
