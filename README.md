Her journey from Canterbury to Rome was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder – the camaraderie of fellow pilgrims huddled around crackling fires, the chilling beauty of the Alps under a star-dusted sky, the hushed awe of ancient ruins whispering tales of empires long gone.

Yet, for Jax, the vastness of space held a siren's call, promising untold mysteries and the heady excitement of pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
