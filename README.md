
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing a perilous route to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the sky, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of something beyond the mundane, fueled his relentless journey eastward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were just a few of the hardships she faced.  But the thought of connecting with a lost human civilization, of charting unknown territories amongst a tapestry of stars, spurred her onward, a descendant of countless adventurers who dared to reach for the beyond.
