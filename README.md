
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to have joined a mercenary company heading east.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrubland, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the unwavering desire to reunite with her kin spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint but persistent in the cosmic hum.   Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was commonplace,  yet the true adventure lay in the unknown. The potential for discovering new life, lost civilizations, or even encountering unexplored celestial phenomena, fueled her journey across the vast, glittering expanse of space.
