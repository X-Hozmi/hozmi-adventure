
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees mountains were less daunting than the reason for her journey: to find her brother, lost in the crusades years past. Each creaking wagon wheel, each fleeting glimpse of a distant castle, held the promise—or the threat—of her quest's fulfillment. The rough terrain tested her resilience, but the hope of reunion fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby as she navigated asteroid fields and charted unmapped nebulae, her mission to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a powerful, ancient technology.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril, the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of interstellar travel.  Yet, the thrill of discovery and the potential for salvation overshadowed all fear.
