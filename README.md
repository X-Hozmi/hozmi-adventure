
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the Ardennes forest, was treacherous.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a reminder of the brigands and wild beasts that lurked in the shadows.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the love for his sister fueled his relentless pursuit across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue plasma bursts was routine for her, but the loneliness of interstellar travel weighed heavily.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars, was a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of life she'd left behind.  Yet, the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning for humanity, propelled her forward across the cosmic ocean.
