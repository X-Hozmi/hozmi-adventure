
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map – her only guide to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and promise, the journey a constant dance between hope and the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Ahead lay the possibility of new life, of undiscovered resources, but also the very real danger of unforeseen cosmic phenomena, hostile alien life, and the ever-present risk of catastrophic system failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.
