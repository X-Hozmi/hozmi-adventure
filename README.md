
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the darkening forest, fueled both his fear and his determination.  Robbers, bandits, and the unforgiving terrain itself posed constant threats, but the thought of his sister spurred him onwards, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of the medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the gas giant Kepler-186f, a resource crucial to saving her dying home planet.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, pirate attacks a constant threat, and the alien fauna of Kepler-186f both beautiful and terrifying.  But the weight of her people's survival fueled her courage, making her a fearless explorer in the vast, uncharted ocean of the cosmos.
