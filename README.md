
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance.  Days bled into weeks, marked by encounters with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of having survived another day closer to their sacred destination, fueled by faith and the unwavering hope of finding solace and healing.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted towards the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies and unknown alien life.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time, but the journey, though measured in light years, was fueled by the same human spirit of exploration and the insatiable curiosity that had driven travelers for millennia – only now, the destinations were galaxies away.
