
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown fueled her onward, each hardship forging a resilience only the road could bestow.  The camaraderie of fellow travelers, the kindness of strangers, and the breathtaking beauty of the landscape were rewards as potent as the spiritual solace she sought.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task demanding both unparalleled skill and unwavering courage.  Facing the unpredictable hazards of warp storms, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction, Nova and her crew pressed on, their dedication fueled by the boundless curiosity of humankind and the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, and untold wonders beyond the pale blue dot they left behind.
