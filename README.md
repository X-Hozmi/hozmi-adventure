
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held more hope than coin, her destination a fabled monastery rumored to possess ancient healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, but the whispered tales of the monastery's power spurred her onward.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable weather were constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown pushed her deeper into the heart of the Iberian peninsula.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to be teeming with both untold riches and lethal dangers.  Warp jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, but the thought of powering the galactic federation with this new energy was a fire in her belly, a thrill far surpassing any terrestrial fear.  The journey was fraught with peril, but for Ryla, the vast expanse of space held a freedom and exhilaration that dwarfed even the wildest medieval dreams.
