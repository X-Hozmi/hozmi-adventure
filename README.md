
Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of sun-baked earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and recover the stolen Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and past brooding forests rumored to be haunted by ancient evils. Each day was a gamble against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of his mission.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a marathon of hyperspace jumps, each a calculated risk against cosmic radiation and the unpredictable currents of the void.  Her mission, far more ambitious than Gareth's, was to locate and secure a potential new source of energy for a dying Earth, a journey fraught with peril from uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from any rescue.
