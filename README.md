
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each sunrise brought the chilling prospect of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies. Yet, the lure of the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, propelled her onward.  The rhythmic clop of hooves and the distant cry of a hawk were the soundtrack to her perilous journey, a stark contrast to the comfortable life she'd left behind in a quest for both fortune and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored haven for advanced technology lost to time.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr cruisers was a daily challenge, a far cry from the meticulously planned voyages of the Galactic Federation.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, but the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, fueled his relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
