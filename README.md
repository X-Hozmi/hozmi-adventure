
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant battle hangs heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next crest. Her journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria is fraught with peril; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease test her resilience at every turn.  Each sunrise brings a fresh challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory, fueling her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, is fraught with its own anxieties:  uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Advanced technology offers a different kind of challenge;  navigating complex astrogation charts, managing life support systems, and dealing with the psychological pressures of interstellar travel test the crew's mettle.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the hope of a new beginning, keeps their engines running toward the unknown.
