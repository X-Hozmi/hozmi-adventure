
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under a bruised sky, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest, to recover the stolen relic of Saint Elara, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests haunted by brigands, and across rivers swollen with the spring thaw. Each sunrise brought new dangers, from skirmishes with rival knights to the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the holy symbol in his dreams spurred him onward, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the cosmic distances remained daunting.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing vital systems after a near-miss with a rogue planet kept her crew on edge. But the faint hope of finding survivors, and the allure of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled their relentless journey across the vast expanse of space.
