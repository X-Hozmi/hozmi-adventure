
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of anxiety through him.  He carried a king's ransom in gold, entrusted to him for a desperate bid to secure a powerful alliance – a journey fraught with peril, bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His adventure was a gamble, a test of his loyalty and endurance, played out against the backdrop of a war-torn Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant lullaby against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a prize coveted by several warring interstellar factions.  The risks were astronomical –  pirates, malfunctioning equipment, and the unpredictable nature of alien environments were just some of the hazards. But the allure of exploration, the thrill of pushing the boundaries of known space, fueled her courage, driving her across the galaxy on a quest far more dangerous than any medieval knight could ever imagine.
