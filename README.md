
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  The journey was perilous, fraught with bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unfamiliar terrains, bartering for supplies in hostile villages, and outwitting opportunistic lords eager to exploit their desperation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their relentless progress.

Centuries later, in the year 2742, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to contain a planet brimming with a life-sustaining energy source crucial to humanity's survival.  Navigating treacherous nebulae, dodging asteroid fields, and evading the hostile K'tharr warships, Eva faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the promise of discovery, but also the terrifying possibility of encountering the unknown, a vast and unforgiving cosmos teeming with both wonder and peril.
