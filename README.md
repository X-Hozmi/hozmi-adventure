
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had already tested their mettle.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and weeks of meager rations had thinned their supplies and frayed their nerves. Yet, the unwavering faith of Reginald, and the youthful, burgeoning hope of Thomas, spurred them across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a renewed promise of reaching their sacred destination.  The weight of their worn pack, filled with meager belongings and fervent prayer, was nothing compared to the weight of their devotion.

Alternatively, in 2742, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory space krakens of the Xylos system,  Elara and her crew battled malfunctioning hyperdrives and dwindling fuel reserves, their determination fueled by the hope of finding survivors. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across vast, uncharted territories in the hope of finding a distant beacon of life.
