
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in a tavern tale.  Yet, the urgency in her heart spurred her onward, a flicker of defiance against the vast, indifferent wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of preventing a devastating solar flare.  Navigation was a symphony of complex calculations and the hushed whispers of the AI.  The emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of nebulae and the occasional asteroid field, was a different kind of fear than Elara's; a cold, isolating vastness that tested the courage of even the most seasoned explorer.  Yet, the promise of salvation for her people drove her forward, across unimaginable distances.
