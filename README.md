
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a faint comfort against the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger.  Her worn map, a testament to countless tear-stained revisions, guides her towards the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold riches – or perhaps only death in the unforgiving desert.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, holds its breath in anticipation of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey measured not in leagues but light-years.  The vast, inky blackness holds both the promise of alien life and the chilling reality of the unpredictable cosmic storms that threaten to tear her ship apart.  Yet, the allure of exploration, the yearning to push humanity's boundaries, drives her onward, a lone voyager in the uncharted seas of space.
