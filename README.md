
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Ys, a city of shimmering spires and healing waters, fueled her onward, a beacon in the harsh landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver splinter against the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Vast distances stretched before them, light-years separating star systems, and the dangers were far more insidious than bandits – rogue asteroids, cosmic radiation, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life. But the promise of a new beginning, a future beyond Earth’s dying sun, spurred them across the unimaginable gulf of space.
