
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her leather jerkin chafed, her water skin nearly empty, but the thrill of the unknown spurred her on.  She carried a whispered map, a promise of a lost city rumored to hold unimaginable riches – a gamble against bandits, harsh weather, and the gnawing fear of the endless horizon.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a breathtaking contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of engine failure, was a far cry from the medieval treks of her ancestors. Yet, the same spirit of intrepid exploration burned within her, the allure of the unknown a siren song echoing across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
