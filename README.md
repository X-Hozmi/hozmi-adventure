
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each pass held the promise of discovery, but also the threat of bandits, blizzards, and starvation.  My meager supplies dwindled with each day, yet the lure of the fabled city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, pushed me onward. The vast, unforgiving landscape tested my endurance, shaping me as much as the journey itself.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae painted the viewport in breathtaking colours, a stark contrast to the sterile perfection of the bridge. Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization scattered across the stars. The challenges were different now – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering ancient alien signals, and facing the unknown dangers lurking in the vast emptiness of space. But the thrill of discovery, the push towards the uncharted, remained the same.
