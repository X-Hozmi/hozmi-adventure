
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promises riches in the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous rivers swollen with spring thaw, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions.  But the glint of gold in her dreams, and the whispered tales of a lost civilization, fuel her relentless trek eastward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, she races against time to reach the Xylos system, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch of specialists from across the colonized planets, face alien threats, engine malfunctions, and the chilling uncertainty of the unknown.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, a canvas of shimmering nebulae and distant suns, holds both unimaginable beauty and deadly dangers as they strive for a future beyond the reach of their failing homeworld.
