
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the lost artifact of Saint Ursula, rumored to be hidden within a crumbling monastery nestled high in the Carpathian Mountains.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the biting winds offered little respite from the gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought new perils, from treacherous mountain passes to the ever-present threat of disease, yet the glint of the rumored relic spurred him onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, but the true challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic distress signal – a fragmented song of pure energy that hinted at something far more unsettling than a simple mechanical failure.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to the colonists' fate, and Eva, a seasoned explorer, was determined to find it.
