
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the elements and the malice of men. Yet, with every mile swallowed by the endless road, her determination hardened, fueled by a faith that transcended the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace still held a thrill, a constant reminder of the vast, uncharted territories that lay beyond known galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with risks ranging from rogue asteroids to hostile alien encounters.  The cosmos, despite its breathtaking beauty, held a brutal indifference, making each successful jump a hard-won victory.
