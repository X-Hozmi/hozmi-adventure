
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of pack animals and weathered faces, creeps across the sun-baked plains toward the rumored city of Zerzura.  Whispers of untold riches and a lost oasis fuel our journey, a perilous trek through bandit-infested passes and unforgiving deserts. Each sunrise brings the threat of starvation or ambush, each sunset the quiet hope of reaching our destination before succumbing to the harshness of the land.  The stars, our only constant guide, offer little comfort against the gnawing fear and the ever-present dust.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its navigation systems charting a course to the uncharted Kepler-186f.  The thrill of exploration burns brighter than any sun, but the vastness of space holds its own dangers: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling possibility of encountering alien lifeforms beyond our comprehension.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by the relentless pursuit of discovery.
