
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices – a dangerous cargo, but the only way to save her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the freedom of the open road, fueled her onward, a stark contrast to the stifling confines of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the iridescent colours a breathtaking distraction from the perilous jump to Kepler-186f.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hummed with the energy of warp drive, a fragile bubble against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  The mission: to locate a lost colony, a gamble fraught with the potential for alien encounters, hostile environments, and the ever-present threat of navigational error that could strand them light-years from home.  But the allure of exploration, of pushing humanity's boundaries, burned brighter than any fear.
