
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar perfume of the long road. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Each sunrise revealed a tapestry of rolling hills, dark forests whispering secrets, and bustling market towns teeming with colorful characters – some helpful, some treacherous. His journey was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature, but the lure of Ys burned bright within him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The ship hummed with the quiet efficiency of advanced technology, a stark contrast to the creaking wagons and unpredictable beasts of Thomas's era.  Eva's journey was a calculated risk, navigating asteroid fields, hostile alien territories, and the ever-present threat of engine failure. But the promise of new beginnings, the chance to forge a path for humanity amongst the stars, fueled her determination across the vast, uncharted ocean of space.
