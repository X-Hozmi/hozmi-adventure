
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, his destination the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown propelled him forward, a thirst for adventure burning brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of incandescent gas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across the Andromeda galaxy millennia ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were commonplace dangers, but the vast, unknowable expanse of space held a different kind of thrill.  The sheer scale of the journey, the possibility of discovering new life forms and ancient civilizations, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic sea.
