
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the peaks jagged teeth against a bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her exiled brother, a whispered rumour of his location fueling her perilous journey across the war-torn kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure and danger, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Bandit ambushes, crumbling bridges, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the challenges she faced.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Razor' Rourke piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for intergalactic travel.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to a faster-than-light drive.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But unlike the limited horizons of the medieval world, Razor's adventure stretched across the unimaginable vastness of space, a voyage into the unknown promising unimaginable rewards, or equally unimaginable destruction.
