
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her small band, a motley collection of knights, mercenaries, and a surprisingly agile monk, pressed onward, their destination the rumored hidden monastery of Saint Gildas, whispered to hold the secret to a potent healing balm.  Every league was a gamble; bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any mythical cure, but the promise of adventure, of proving her worth beyond the confines of her noble birth, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light years to the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The thrill wasn't just the discovery of potential new life, but the inherent risk of traversing uncharted space.  Wormhole instability, pirate raids from the Kryll Confederacy, and the sheer isolation of deep space travel were constant companions. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to expand human knowledge and claim her place amongst the galaxy's intrepid explorers, overshadowed every danger.  The cosmos, vast and terrifying, held a siren song she couldn't resist.
