
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispers of mythical creatures kept her ever vigilant.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of Zerzura, a city rumored to hold unimaginable riches and knowledge, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable space weather, the vastness of the cosmos both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of the storm, spurred her crew onward, across the immeasurable distances between worlds.
