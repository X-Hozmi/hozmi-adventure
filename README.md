
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as he traversed the rugged English countryside, bound for the distant monastery of St. Jude.  His quest: to retrieve a sacred relic, a journey fraught with peril, not only from bandits and treacherous terrain, but from the whispers of magic and the looming shadow of a vengeful sorcerer. Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and outsmarting cunning highwaymen – a constant test of courage and resilience.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the Kepler-186f system.  Her mission: to establish first contact with a newly discovered sentient species. The vastness of space held its own terrors;  uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels prowling the interstellar lanes.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery beyond the human realm, propelled her forward, fueled by the same intrepid spirit that had driven countless adventurers before her, across continents and cosmos alike.
