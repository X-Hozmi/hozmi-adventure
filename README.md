
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking cart wheel and barking dog were potential threats, bandits a constant shadow in the lawless countryside.  The journey was grueling, a test of endurance, but the hope of salvation fueled her every step, transforming the seemingly endless road into a path towards destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Theron piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated efficiency of her ship's navigation system.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a journey across light-years and through treacherous asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet unforgiving, demanded precision and courage, a far cry from the medieval treks of her ancestors, but the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly within her.
