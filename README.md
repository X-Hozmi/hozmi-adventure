
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was far from over; bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Zerzura, a place said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward, a beacon against the encroaching despair. Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the landscape, was a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Navigating hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances, but the potential rewards – a fabled planet rich in Xylium crystals – were worth the risk.  The hum of the engines, the vast emptiness of space surrounding them, and the constant vigilance required to avoid celestial debris all served as a reminder of the immense dangers inherent in interstellar travel.  But for Ryla, the thrill of discovery, the chance to chart unknown territories, outweighed every fear.
