
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Seraphin, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barked command to the mule, each treacherous mountain pass was a step closer to either salvation or despair, a constant gamble against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the Galactic Federation's experimental warp drive from the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the insidious effects of prolonged hyperspace travel were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like Eva.  The vast, uncharted reaches of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers, a constant push against the boundaries of human exploration.
