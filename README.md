
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the next hill, the harsh sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest – to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys – had taken him across treacherous mountain passes, through fetid swamps teeming with bandits, and past villages ravaged by plague.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for supplies with suspicious locals, and constantly fending off the ever-present threat of highwaymen.  His hope, fuelled by ancient maps and whispered legends, pushed him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of the bridge.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, held both the promise of discovery and the constant threat of annihilation.
