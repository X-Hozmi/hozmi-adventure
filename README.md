
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her family, clinging to a slim chance of reaching the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease stalk her every step, but the promise of a better life fuels her onward, each sunrise a new test of courage and endurance in this unforgiving medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, is fraught with peril: unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive straining against the fabric of spacetime.  But the allure of a new world, untouched and brimming with possibility, pushes Rexx and his crew to brave the infinite distances between stars, each jump a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
