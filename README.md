
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in silks and spices, a desperate gamble to pay off his family's debts.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent shivers down his spine – bandits, disease, and the unforgiving landscape all threatened his journey from Constantinople to Prague.  The thrill of adventure, however, outweighed the fear; the promise of riches and the sheer challenge of traversing the vast unknown spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, peppered with the glittering jewels of distant galaxies, both inspired awe and instilled a healthy respect for the unpredictable dangers of asteroid fields and rogue solar flares.  Unlike Thomas, Eva faced a technologically advanced, but equally perilous journey, relying on sophisticated navigation and a crew's skill to reach her goal, a new frontier for humankind.
