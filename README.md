The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the sorcerer Malkor, rumored to reside in a hidden valley beyond the treacherous pass.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush, a constant reminder of the perils facing him on this arduous journey across the blighted lands.  Survival, let alone success, demanded courage, cunning, and an unwavering resolve.
