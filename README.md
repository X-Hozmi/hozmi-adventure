
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the grey sky, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, pushed him ever closer to his perilous goal, a testament to the bravery and resilience of medieval adventurers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  Advanced technology provided comfort and speed, but the vast emptiness of space held its own perils – unpredictable wormholes, pirate fleets, and the chilling silence of interstellar travel.  Yet, the promise of discovery, and the relentless human drive to explore, propelled her starship forward, mirroring the intrepid spirit of her medieval predecessors.
