His journey across the fractured kingdom had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

The vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of planets and star clusters, all potential dangers or destinations in a seemingly endless expanse.
