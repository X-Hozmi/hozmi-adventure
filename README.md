
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the Provençal countryside.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests,  villages whispered of monstrous beasts in the mountains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing her courage and resilience as she traversed the vast, unforgiving landscape, her hope as stubborn as the mule she rode.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers. Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of alien races a constant battle.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a unique set of challenges, demanding split-second decisions and unwavering trust in her crew.  The prize was immense, but the risks were even greater, a gamble on the very survival of her people.
