
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance and courage, but the whispered promises of Zerzura’s hidden oasis fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic map of the Andromeda galaxy shimmering before him.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, was ready for its next jump.  The voyage to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable nebulae, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms were just a few of the dangers that lay ahead. But for Rexx, the thrill of exploration, the chance to rewrite the history of interstellar travel, outweighed all fear.
