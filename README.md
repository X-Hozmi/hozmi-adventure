
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held the last of her family's meager belongings, a testament to their desperate flight from the encroaching war.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the distant, hazy silhouette of the mountains – her destination and a hope for a new life – spurred her onward, fueled by a fierce determination that outweighed the gnawing hunger and crippling fatigue.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to galactic peace.  The journey, a harrowing six-month voyage through uncharted space, had already claimed two crew members and tested the ship's hull to its limits.  But Rexx, hardened by years of interstellar skirmishes and fuelled by a burning belief in his mission, remained steadfast, his gaze fixed on the distant emerald glow of his target – a new beginning for a fractured galaxy.
