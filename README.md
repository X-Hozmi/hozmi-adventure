
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, trudged onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s magnificence, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the ever-present threat of death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, the *Hope*, presumed lost in the uncharted nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, a constant vigilance against cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, tested her crew's resilience, forging bonds of friendship and courage in the face of the unimaginable distances and perils of interstellar travel.
