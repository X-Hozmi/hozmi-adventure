
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the cliff face, and the constant gnawing hunger threatening to break their resolve.  But the lure of the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred them onward, their hope a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek starship capable of folding space, jumping between galaxies in a breathtaking ballet of light and energy. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking interstellar travel's ultimate potential.  Nebulae painted breathtaking canvases across the void, but the constant threat of pirate raids and unpredictable wormhole instabilities kept the crew on high alert.  The vast expanse of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that dwarfed any medieval peril.
