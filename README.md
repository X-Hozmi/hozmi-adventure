
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of nervous energy through him.  He carried a king's ransom in gold, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, and a heart heavy with the knowledge that his journey was a race against time and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Success meant salvation for thousands, failure… oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst colossal, incandescent clouds.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had already taken generations, the crew living and dying in cryo-sleep, a constant cycle of hope and resignation. Elara, however, felt the thrill of exploration pulse through her veins. The unknown beckoned, a symphony of celestial bodies and untold wonders, promising both unimaginable riches and terrifying dangers lurking in the vast, unexplored darkness of space.  The fate of her people rested on her ability to reach the fabled Xylos system, a cradle of advanced technology and a potential lifeline for a dying civilization.
