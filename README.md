
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort but plenty of challenge.  Each bend held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unpredictable whims of nature itself.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King across the treacherous mountain pass, was fraught with peril, but the thrill of the unknown, the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles, spurred him on. The glint of the distant sun through the trees promised not just the end of his journey, but the hope of a reward – and perhaps a well-deserved ale.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation through the treacherous Kepler-186f nebula was a constant battle against cosmic radiation and unpredictable asteroid fields.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, a desperate gamble with time and resources.  While lacking the immediate, visceral dangers of Reginald’s journey, Eva faced a different kind of adversity; the isolating vastness of space, the constant threat of equipment malfunction, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown that stretched for light-years in every direction.
