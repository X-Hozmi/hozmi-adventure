
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I journeyed across the snow-covered Alps.  Each pass was a gamble, a test of endurance against the elements and the ever-present threat of bandits.  My meager supplies dwindled with each day, the distant promise of the Italian plains a faint beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape. The thrill of the unknown, the challenge of survival, fueled my steps towards a destination that held both riches and peril.


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as our ship warped through the Andromeda galaxy.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant colour as we navigated the treacherous asteroid fields, our course charted by the ancient whispers of long-dead civilizations.  The alien landscapes of Xylos, with its bioluminescent flora and gravity-defying creatures, were a stark contrast to the familiar Earth, a testament to the boundless wonders and terrifying unknowns that lie beyond our solar system. Each jump was a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.
