
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Bordeaux, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a treacherous path across the Pyrenees mountains, then the dusty plains of Castile, each step a gamble against bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Our meager supplies – dried meats, hardtack, and a worn map – were all that stood between us and the unknown lands of the East, where whispered legends spoke of silks, spices, and unimaginable wealth.  Every sunrise brought fresh challenges, every sunset a testament to our resilience.

Fast forward centuries to 2742. The Althea, a starship honed to perfection by generations of interstellar engineers, cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos. Our mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, venturing into star systems yet unnamed, and to seek out habitable planets for humanity's expansion.  The vastness of space, peppered with celestial wonders and the potential for unimaginable discoveries, dwarfed the petty concerns of Earth.  Every jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling plunge into the cosmic ocean of existence.
