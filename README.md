
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing hunger of a long journey. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his every step, turning the hardship into a thrilling, if perilous, adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a constant challenge.  But the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the cosmos – made the risks worthwhile, transforming a dangerous journey into an exploration of the unimaginable.
