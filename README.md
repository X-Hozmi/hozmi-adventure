
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather jerkin testament to the months spent journeying.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, the whispered tales of exotic spices and opulent cities, pushed her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape. Her quest for a legendary healer across the known world fuelled her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Navigation charts pulsed with holographic constellations, guiding her across unimaginable distances between planets teeming with alien life – some welcoming, others fiercely hostile.  Her mission: to deliver a vital cargo across the galaxy, a race against time and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, her courage a match for the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
