
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their strength and endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, they pushed further, their resolve hardened by the shared hardship and the unwavering faith that guided their steps. The promise of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled their arduous trek across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror.  Unpredictable solar flares threatened to fry their systems, rogue asteroids danced a deadly ballet, and the chilling silence between the stars was broken only by the hum of the ship's engines. Yet, the pursuit of knowledge and the boundless potential of the cosmos spurred her onward, each jump to warp speed a leap into the breathtaking, perilous unknown.
