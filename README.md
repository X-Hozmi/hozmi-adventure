
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the endless expanse of the desert threatened to swallow him whole. Yet, the glint of gold rumored to be within Zerzura's walls spurred him on, each day a gamble against starvation, exhaustion, and the unpredictable whims of fate.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart, but for the foolhardy and fiercely determined.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigation was treacherous, fraught with asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of spacetime anomalies.  The weight of responsibility for her crew rested heavily on her shoulders, yet the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, fueled her unwavering resolve.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, and Eva embraced them both.
