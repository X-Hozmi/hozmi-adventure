
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his mount across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and recover the stolen Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy forests where bandits lurked and whispers of mythical beasts echoed through the ancient trees.  Each sunrise brought new perils, but the promise of glory and the weight of his king's trust spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and return with vital genetic samples.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble against spatial distortions and rogue asteroids, and communication lags with Earth were agonizing.  Yet, the vastness of space, shimmering with nebulae and distant galaxies, held a certain majestic terror, and the hope of discovery fueled her brave journey across the interstellar void.
