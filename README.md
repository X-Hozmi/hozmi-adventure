
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward. The trail was treacherous, a ribbon of mud snaking through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and rumors of a monstrous beast haunting the Black Mire fueled the campfire whispers each night.  Yet, Reginald pressed on, driven by the promise of the fabled Sunstone, said to grant its possessor untold power, a prize worth risking life and limb to claim. The journey tested his mettle, his loyalty, and his very faith, each day bringing new perils and unexpected allies.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a perilous dance amongst asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, the vastness of space both breathtaking and terrifying.  Her mission: to retrieve a crucial data-core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense - hostile alien lifeforms, malfunctioning equipment, and the ever-present threat of getting hopelessly lost amongst the stars.  But the potential rewards were even greater, a leap for humanity into a new era of interstellar exploration.
