
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his armor caked in dust, guides his weary steed through the dense Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the lost scroll of King Arthur.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey across the fractured landscape of medieval Europe.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a fragile hope of reaching his destination before winter's grip tightens its icy hold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust'.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hum, hyper-jumps fracture spacetime, and the constant threat of pirate raids and unforeseen celestial anomalies demand unwavering vigilance.  Vast distances and alien landscapes stretch before her, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, demanding both courage and cutting-edge technology to overcome.
