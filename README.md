
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each sunset a chilling reminder of the vast, unforgiving distance that still lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home.  Warp jumps were treacherous, pirate attacks a constant threat, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel a relentless pressure.  But the promise of success, the potential to save countless lives, fueled her every decision, driving her through the cold, indifferent expanse of space.
