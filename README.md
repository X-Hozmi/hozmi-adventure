
Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the pre-dawn light, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, snaked towards the unknown.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with forgotten magic, fueled his journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of discovery, punctuated by the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  He traveled with only his loyal squire, their supplies dwindling with each passing league, their resolve hardening with every challenge overcome.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony light-years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in leagues but in light-years, the dangers not lurking bandits but cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  The vast emptiness of space held a unique kind of adventure, a thrilling solitude broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling comms from distant bases.  Each successful jump through hyperspace was a victory in a vast, unforgiving expanse.
