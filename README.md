
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward, the muddy track barely visible beneath the relentless downpour.  Each step was a battle against the elements, the biting wind a constant companion to the gnawing hunger in our bellies.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place of untold riches and even more perilous secrets.  We pressed on, driven by hope and a desperate need for something more than the endless gray skies and the ever-present threat of bandits and worse.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Our mission: to recover the lost artifact of the Kryll, a relic said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across entire galaxies.  The dangers were not just of distance and time, but of the Kryll themselves, a race rumored to be both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly powerful, jealous guardians of their ancient technology.
