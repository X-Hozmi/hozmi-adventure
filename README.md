
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel contains not just meager rations, but also a cryptic map promising the location of a lost monastery rumored to hold untold riches – or perhaps, a terrifying secret.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each rustle in the dry brush, is a potential threat in this unforgiving land, demanding vigilance and courage from her at every turn. Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions on this perilous journey to the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Wanderer* across the inky expanse between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace are just part of the daily routine.  The vast, beautiful, and terrifying scope of the cosmos presents a challenge far grander than any medieval quest, demanding not just physical bravery but also scientific ingenuity and unwavering mental fortitude to achieve her ambitious goal.
