
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-covered plains of Russia, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards I’d left behind in France.  My quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Kitezh, felt as far-fetched as the tales spun by wandering bards, yet the glint of gold in a dying monk's eye, the whisper of ancient prophecies, fueled my journey.  Each day brought fresh peril – bandits, blizzards, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones, a far cry from the rhythmic thud of my medieval boots.  Stars blurred past the viewport as we jumped between galaxies, the sheer scale of the cosmos dwarfed even the vastness of the Eurasian steppe.  My mission – a diplomatic expedition to the Xylos system – held its own set of dangers; alien customs, interstellar pirates, and the ever-present threat of technological failure. Yet, the thrill of charting unmapped nebulae and encountering civilizations beyond human comprehension eclipsed any fear, echoing the adventurous spirit of those medieval pilgrims, though my mode of travel had evolved beyond all recognition.
