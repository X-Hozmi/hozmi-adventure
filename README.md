
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she trudges along the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth thick in the air.  Her destination: the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold secrets beyond imagining.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her journey, but the promise of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown spur her onward.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The hum of the hyperdrive thrums beneath her feet as she charts a course for the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage across unmapped star systems teeming with alien life, both friendly and hostile.  The vastness of space dwarfs her vessel, yet the camaraderie of her crew and the allure of discovering new worlds fuel her unwavering determination.  Her journey is a leap of faith into the cosmos, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity.
