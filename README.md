
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Sir Gareth's saddle as his destrier plodded across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality, before the encroaching Black Death consumed his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of legend, propelled him onward, a solitary knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets and stars, but the journey was far from effortless.  Dangerous asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids kept her crew on edge.  But the hope of reuniting with her ancestors, of uncovering the secrets of their lost civilization, fueled her unwavering determination to reach the far edge of the known universe.
