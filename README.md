
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her safekeeping on this perilous journey to the distant monastery.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the promise of salvation spurred her onward through sun-drenched fields and shadowed forests, each sunrise a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, the sheer vastness of the cosmos both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, fueled her crew, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a testament to humanity's insatiable hunger for the beyond.
