
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of salvation, the thrill of the unknown, pushed them relentlessly forward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering hope of finding a miracle.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a dangerous gamble, fraught with the possibility of spatial distortions and encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien lifeforms. But the promise of rediscovering humanity's lost kin, the chance to unravel the mysteries of a forgotten past, fuelled her unwavering determination, making each jump across the cosmic void a leap into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the future.
