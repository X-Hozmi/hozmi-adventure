
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the gnawing hunger of the endless journey.  Yet, the lure of legend, the promise of untold riches and knowledge, fueled his weary limbs, driving him further into the unknown heart of the world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the human colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates became commonplace, the vastness of space a constant reminder of humanity’s fragility. Yet, the view of distant galaxies, the thrill of exploration across the cosmic sea, and the hope of connecting distant worlds outweighed the risks, making every journey a testament to human resilience and the insatiable need to venture beyond the known.
