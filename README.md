
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – rare, potent seeds vital to her village's survival.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her perilous journey, testing her resolve at every turn. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new ford to cross, a new mountain pass to navigate, but the promise of sustenance for her people fuels her onward, a flickering ember of hope in the vast darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids is a daily routine, far removed from the earthy dangers Elara faced. Yet, the isolation, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the constant threat of unknown cosmic phenomena create a tension as profound as any medieval hardship.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, presents its own unique brand of adventure.
