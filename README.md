
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's worn leather boots as he pushes his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each winding trail presents a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders fuel his determination, pushing him further into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey is a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the crackling static of long-range communications.  Vast distances and unpredictable wormholes present constant peril, but the hope of reuniting with a lost civilization, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars, makes the unimaginable risks worthwhile.
