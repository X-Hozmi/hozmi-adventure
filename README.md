
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her journey to Florence, a pilgrimage of sorts to learn the secrets of the master glassmakers, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the promise of discovery a powerful antidote to fear.  Each hardship, each breathtaking vista, etched itself into her memory, forging an indomitable spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity's expanding reach.  The vastness of space, peppered with nebulae of vibrant colour and the distant shimmer of uncharted planets, instilled a profound sense of awe and responsibility.  Though the journey was punctuated by asteroid fields, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien life,  the potential rewards – the discovery of new worlds, new knowledge – far outweighed the dangers. The cosmos beckoned, and Ryla, at the helm, answered its call.
