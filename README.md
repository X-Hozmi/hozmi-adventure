
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for both peril and promise – bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope for his sister fueled his journey across the rugged landscapes of medieval Europe, a tapestry of breathtaking beauty and deadly danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the unpredictable effects of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, stretched before them, a constant reminder of the immense risks and potentially unimaginable rewards of interstellar travel.
