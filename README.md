
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, blizzards threatened to bury her alive, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, the whispered tales of the lost city of Zerzura, a city of gold said to lie beyond the peaks, fueled her relentless pursuit, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.  Each creak of saddle leather and each labored breath were milestones on her arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense challenges of interstellar travel.  Warp-core fluctuations, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks kept her crew on edge, but the potential discovery of a new world, a new beginning for humanity, overshadowed every risk.  The cosmos held endless wonders, but also endless dangers.
