
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched earth, the relentless sun beating down on her and her mule.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, had been arduous.  Bandits had tested her mettle, treacherous terrain had challenged her strength, and the gnawing hunger had pushed her to her limits. Yet, the glint of adventure, the promise of uncovering the unknown, burned brighter than any hardship, driving her onward toward the horizon's shimmering mirage.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lurked in the unexplored sectors, where alien lifeforms, both benevolent and malevolent, awaited.  The vastness of space, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknown, held the promise of discovery, but also the ever-present threat of annihilation.
