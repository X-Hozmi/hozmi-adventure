
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to overtake her.  Yet, the whisper of hope, fueled by tales of Zerzura's miraculous healing springs, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rendar piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a breathtaking distraction from the perilous jump into the Xylos system.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the remote mining colony on Xylos Prime, a planet notorious for its unpredictable gravitational anomalies and aggressive native lifeforms.  With his loyal crew beside him, Razor navigated asteroid fields and dodged pirate ambushes, their journey a thrilling dance between courage, skill, and sheer luck amidst the vast, unknowable expanse of space.
