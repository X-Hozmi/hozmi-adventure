
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of Francia, a stark contrast to the tales of vibrant cities and rich harvests whispered in the taverns he’d left behind.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for his brother's mysterious illness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of the Black Death itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, but the hope for his brother fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring expedition to the uncharted galaxy of Cygnus X-1, searching for a mythical energy source known only as "Aetherium."  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was child's play compared to the political intrigue and rivalries that threatened to derail her mission.  Eva, however, was undeterred.  The vast emptiness of space was no match for her courage and the burning desire to uncover the secrets of Aetherium, a discovery that could alter the fate of humanity itself.
