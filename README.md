
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Yet, the whispered tales of shimmering spires and healing waters fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unmapped stellar currents and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the cold brilliance of distant suns, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of charting new worlds and expanding human understanding, kept the engines humming and her heart pounding with the thrilling rhythm of interstellar exploration.
