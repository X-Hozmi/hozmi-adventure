
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed forests of Arden, rumored to hold both untold riches and terrifying beasts.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to possess a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience as she navigated treacherous paths and skirted suspicious settlements, her journey a tapestry woven from danger and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space, however, held its own perils.  Unstable wormholes threatened to tear her ship apart, and alien encounters ranged from the curious to the aggressively hostile.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration and the promise of a new beginning amongst the stars.
