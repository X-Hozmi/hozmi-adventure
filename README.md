
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, was their only guide through the unforgiving landscape, a testament to their unwavering determination against seemingly insurmountable odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a jarring experience, a blinding flash followed by the eerie stillness of traversing the fabric of spacetime.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirate fleets that preyed on interstellar trade were commonplace dangers on her perilous voyage across the galaxy, a far cry from the medieval knight's simpler, yet no less harrowing, struggles.
