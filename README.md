
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, inched its way across the unforgiving plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Whispers of its opulence and hidden dangers fueled their journey, a tapestry woven with the threads of scorching sun, sudden sandstorms, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, and a renewed hope for the legendary riches that awaited.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace lever, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent light. His ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with perils – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – but the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, spurred them onward towards the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
