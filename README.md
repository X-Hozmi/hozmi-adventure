
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, guided his destrier through the mud-choked track.  Each creak of the saddle, each splash of water, was a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of hooves.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the hazards he faced on his perilous journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him only his sword, his shield, and an unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was a different kind of wilderness, filled with gravitational anomalies, radiation storms, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, possibly hostile, alien civilizations.  Yet, with the hum of the hyperdrive and the comforting glow of the navigation console, Eva pressed onward, driven by the hope of discovery and the thrill of charting the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
