
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's writ, a crumpled scroll clutched in his sweaty hand, promised riches and glory in the far east – enough to erase the memory of his impoverished childhood.  But the road was a treacherous beast, filled with bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in his arduous journey across the continent.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant light-years from her home planet.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, held as much danger as the medieval roads – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates prowling the black.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to unlock the universe's secrets, pushed her ever onward.
