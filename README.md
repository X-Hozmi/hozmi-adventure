
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Each creak of the wooden wheels was a challenge, each sun-baked mile a victory.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages.  But the lure of the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves, spurred her onward.  She carried with her not just meager supplies, but a fierce spirit and a map older than any king.  This journey was not merely about reaching a destination; it was a battle against the elements, against hardship, and against the very limits of human endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f was risky, a gamble on uncharted hyperspace lanes.  Alien storms raged outside, and the threat of pirates—human and otherwise—was ever-present.  But the promise of a new world, teeming with undiscovered life and resources, fueled her engines and her unwavering resolve.  The universe was a vast and perilous ocean, but for Ryla, the endless expanse held far greater allure than any earthly kingdom.
