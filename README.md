
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the chill wind biting at her cheeks.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast, unforgiving Sahara.  Each day was a gamble – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, scorching sun threatened dehydration, and the endless dunes held secrets both beautiful and terrifying.  Her journey, a quest for a lost scroll containing ancient wisdom, tested her resilience and pushed her to the edge of endurance, forging a strength born not of muscle but unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through a nebula of incandescent gas, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a desperate search for a new home for a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the bureaucratic politics of intergalactic travel proved just as challenging as facing the harsh realities of deep space.  The vast expanse of the cosmos offered breathtaking beauty, but also held terrifying unknowns, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
