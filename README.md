
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of London, the stench of unwashed bodies and rotting refuse clinging to our clothes.  Ahead lies a perilous trek across Europe, a tapestry woven with the threads of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  We seek the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a legend fueling our weary steps across sun-baked plains and frost-bitten forests. Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar dialects to bartering for meager supplies in hostile villages.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive as we leap across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in myth, rumored to possess a singularity capable of rewriting the fabric of spacetime.  The crew, a ragtag band of explorers from a dozen worlds, braces for the unpredictable anomalies of intergalactic travel – rogue asteroids, gravitational distortions, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien life.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos, fueled by the lure of discovery and the intoxicating promise of the impossible.
