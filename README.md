
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the growing darkness.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing an ancient text rumored to cure the Black Death, fueled her perilous journey across the treacherous terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadowed valleys and dense forests.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of swirling cosmic dust.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a technological leap humanity desperately needed to survive the encroaching Xy'lar Hegemony.  The shimmering expanse of the cosmos, breathtaking in its beauty, held a different kind of danger – pirate fleets, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies –  a journey demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.
