
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Each step was a gamble against the elements and the unseen dangers lurking in the shadowed valleys.  My meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, but the promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred me onward. The journey was grueling, a test of endurance and will, but the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of discovery, eclipsed every hardship.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, a far cry from the wind's howl.  Stars blurred past the viewport as we jumped across the vast gulf between galaxies, a journey measured not in days, but in light years.  The risks were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate factions – but the allure remained the same: the uncharted reaches of space, planets teeming with life yet to be discovered, and the exhilarating gamble of pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
