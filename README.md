
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague – drove her across treacherous mountain passes and through shadowed forests teeming with bandits and wild beasts. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a test of her courage and resilience, a constant reminder of the perilous beauty of the medieval world and the uncertainty that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and aggressive alien patrols. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, pressed in on her, but the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding human knowledge, fuelled her unwavering determination to reach their destination.
