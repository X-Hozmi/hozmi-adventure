
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tightly in her calloused hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly. Each creaking cart wheel, each flash of a hawk overhead, was a potential omen, a reminder of the unpredictable nature of the journey and the perilous beauty of the unknown lands ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  The hum of the engines, the crisp crackle of the comms, were his constant companions as he hurtled through the cosmic void, driven by a thirst for discovery that echoed the adventurous spirit of those medieval travelers long before him.
