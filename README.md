
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her cheeks.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a chance to escape the famine ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the dangers that lurked – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself.  Yet, the promise of the fertile lands beyond the mountains spurred her onward, a flicker of defiance in her weary eyes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, its luminescent colours a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of a thousand distant suns.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a journey fraught with the perils of unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of fuel depletion.  But for Eva and her crew, the vast emptiness of space held not fear, but the exhilarating thrill of discovery, the siren call of the unknown echoing across the galaxies.
