
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory against the elements and the dangers of a world untamed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp core failure.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of hostile alien life were commonplace hazards.  Yet, the vast expanse of space, the alien wonders they encountered, and the potential for discovery fueled her unwavering determination to find the lost colonists and bring them home, across light years of daunting and breathtaking adventure.
