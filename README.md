
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, spurred me onward.  The promise of silks, spices, and untold riches fueled my weary body and hardened my resolve against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we jumped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from our own.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Eden promised by the terraforming reports.  Unlike the medieval adventurers, I faced dangers of a different kind:  the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the possibility of hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any rescue. Yet, the hope of discovering a new world, a new beginning, pushed us onward, towards the shimmering nebula on the horizon.
