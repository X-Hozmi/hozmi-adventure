
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s cart as she and her grizzled companion, Thomas, traverse the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a desperate pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of St. Fiacre, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient oaks, while the ever-present threat of starvation and disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – a treacherous river crossing, a hostile village, or the relentless, unforgiving sun beating down on their weary backs.  Yet, the lure of hope, a whisper of salvation, pushes them onward.

Conversely, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Faster-than-light travel strains the ship and crew, the endless expanse of space a constant reminder of their isolation.  But the possibility of uniting warring alien civilizations, of bringing an era of unprecedented harmony, fuels their determination.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory grasp of space pirates are merely obstacles on their ambitious, galaxy-spanning mission.
