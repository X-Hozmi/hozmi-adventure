
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wagon wheels a mournful counterpoint to the cries of hawks circling overhead.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had already claimed several pack animals and tested the resolve of even the hardiest men.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any imagined dragon, turning each sunrise into a precarious gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Every mile was a victory, every sunset a prayer for survival.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the K'tharr Hegemony's territory.  The quest for the legendary Xylos artifact, a source of unimaginable power, was fraught with danger, not from alien beasts, but from rival explorers and the ever-present threat of technological failure light-years from any friendly port.  The vast emptiness of space, paradoxically, felt more claustrophobic than any earthly wilderness.
