
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices – enough to make him a wealthy man – but the road to Damascus was long and perilous.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of every ruined castle, and the plague whispered on the wind.  Each sunrise was a gamble, each sunset a testament to his enduring resilience.  He dreamt not of riches, but of home, a warm hearth, and the sweet face of his wife.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in months of hyperspace travel, was a test of both ship and crew.  Cosmic rays threatened their fragile shields, and the vast emptiness pressed in, a stark contrast to the crowded decks of the vessel.  But the promise of a new beginning, of charting unmapped worlds, fueled her, driving her further into the infinite darkness.
