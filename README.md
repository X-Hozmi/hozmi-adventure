
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's small band crested the hill, the sun beating down on their worn leather armor.  Before them stretched the seemingly endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of green fields and dark forests concealing unknown dangers.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Carcassonne, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the weather threatened unpredictable storms, and the very ground seemed to whisper of ancient curses.  Each day was a gamble, each mile a victory against the elements and the enemies that stalked them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of the ship. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  While the dangers were less tangible than bandits or storms, they were no less perilous.  Uncharted spatial anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure tested her crew’s resilience. The vast emptiness of space, while beautiful, was also terrifyingly lonely, a constant reminder of the immense distance separating them from home.
