
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city of gold, said to be guarded by mythical beasts.  He carried with him only a chipped sword, a worn map, and the burning hope of finding fortune, or perhaps, just survival, in the unforgiving wilderness.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, fueled his anxiety and exhilaration in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast, inky blackness of space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant nebulae swirling around them.  Unlike Thomas's journey, hers was measured in lightyears, not miles, the challenges not wild beasts and bandits, but treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows between stars.  The allure of discovery, however, burned just as brightly in her heart.
