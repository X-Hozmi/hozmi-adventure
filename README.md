
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown desert stretching before us.  Yet, the promise of Zerzura, a city of untold riches and forgotten magic, fuels our relentless journey, pushing us onward despite the hardships.  The journey is brutal, but the allure of adventure trumps all.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cuts through the inky void, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, face perils far removed from bandits and desert storms – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the vast emptiness of space. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, charting uncharted territories among the cosmos, eclipses every risk, drawing us towards the edge of known existence.
