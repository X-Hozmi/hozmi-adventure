
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of York, a seemingly endless procession of creaking wagons and weary travelers.  We traversed the treacherous Yorkshire Moors, the wind a constant companion whipping at our cloaks, and forded rivers swollen with spring rains.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the constant threat of disease, and the ever-present fear of losing our way in the vast, unfamiliar landscape. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the hope of reaching the distant shores of the Mediterranean, fueled our onward march.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The crimson dust of Mars swirled beneath our boots as we prepared for the jump to Proxima Centauri b.  This wasn't a journey measured in weeks or months, but generations.  Cryosleep cocooned us while the Althea, our generation ship, traversed the unimaginable distances between star systems.  The vastness of space, a constant companion, instilled a different kind of awe than the medieval wilderness, yet the primal human desire for exploration, for pushing the boundaries of what's known, remained a constant thread binding both eras.
