
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous, rutted track.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, unforgiving mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the gleam of Zerzura's rumored gold towers, and the hope of saving her brother, fueled her onward, through sun-baked plains and windswept valleys.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, transforming a simple journey into a perilous dance with fate.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and pirate threats that shadowed her journey.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown expanse of the cosmos, but the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel – made the risk worthwhile.
