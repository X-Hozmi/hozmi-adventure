The map, a faded parchment clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches in the faraway kingdom of Eldoria – riches and perhaps, escape from the shadow of the Black Death clinging to his village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sparked a fresh wave of apprehension, yet the lure of adventure, the promise of a new life, spurred him relentlessly towards the unknown.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere obstacles on the path to his destiny.


Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colours and distant galaxies, stretched endlessly before them. Their mission: to locate a habitable planet within the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with dangers unseen.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems under the relentless pressure of interstellar travel pushed their crew to their limits.  Yet, the vastness of space held an undeniable allure, a promise of discovery that outweighed the risks a thousand times over.
