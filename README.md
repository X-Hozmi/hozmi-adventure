
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags as my mule picks its way across the parched landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a daunting but necessary pass on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Whispers of its untold riches and ancient secrets fuel my weary legs, pushing me onward despite the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers, and each sunset, a renewed hope that the legends are true.


Centuries hence, the stars are my highway.  My sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky void, hurtling towards the Andromeda galaxy.  The swirling nebulae are breathtaking, a cosmic tapestry woven with light and gas, but the true adventure lies in the unknown.  Will I find the fabled Xylos civilization, masters of interdimensional travel?  Will I uncover the secrets of the Great Void anomaly?  The risks are immense, the distances unimaginable, but the promise of discovery, of unlocking the universe's most profound mysteries, is a siren song that I cannot resist.
