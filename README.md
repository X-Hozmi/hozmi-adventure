Weeks of relentless travel across the treacherous, bandit-ridden lands had taken their toll, but the thrill of the quest – to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria – still burned bright.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both danger and the possibility of untold riches and glory.  He pushed his weary steed onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The journey between galaxies had been arduous, a test of both ship and crew, pushing the boundaries of known technology.  But the potential discovery – a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – made the risks worthwhile.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held its breath as they approached their destination.
