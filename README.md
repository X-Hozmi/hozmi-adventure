
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the king's decree, a promise of riches and land for whoever delivered it to the besieged city of Aethelburg.  His journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of the Black Forest, and the whispers of plague stalked every village.  But Thomas pressed on, driven by ambition and the faint hope of a better life, navigating treacherous mountain passes and muddy river crossings, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace.  Facing radiation storms and navigating asteroid fields, she relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology, a stark contrast to Thomas’s reliance on grit and instinct.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness, a profound isolation far removed from the bustling medieval world.
