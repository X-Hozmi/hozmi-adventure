
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred him onward, a solitary knight against the vast and unforgiving medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and battling the relentless decay of interstellar travel were but a few of the challenges.  But the hope of finding the lost colonists, and the scientific discoveries that awaited, fueled her crew's unwavering determination as they pushed the boundaries of human exploration across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
