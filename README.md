
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem felt endless, a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of windswept plains, the shadowed menace of dense forests teeming with bandits, and the bustling, vibrant chaos of medieval towns. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager provisions in strange and sometimes hostile villages.  His quest, a holy pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate hope for salvation, pushed him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets and galaxies, transforming the vast expanse of space into a navigable ocean.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of explored space, a perilous journey fraught with the dangers of uncharted star systems, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, yet the promise of discovery and the thrill of exploration propelled her forward.
