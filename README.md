
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, urged his mule onward.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the already indistinct line of the horizon, promising nothing but more endless plains before reaching the rumored city of Zerzura.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrubland, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of the desert itself held terrors more potent than any human foe.  His meager supplies dwindling, Thomas pressed on, driven by a thirst for the unknown, for the fabled riches and perhaps, redemption.

Centuries later, Elara piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from her home world.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic vista outside.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy, a testament to humanity’s insatiable desire to explore.  Yet, the vastness of space, with its unpredictable celestial bodies and lurking dangers, felt as daunting and unpredictable as any medieval wilderness.
