
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were common,  food scarce, and the whispers of plague stalked him like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of breathtaking landscapes – rolling hills giving way to dense forests, then soaring mountains capped with snow – but also the chilling uncertainty of the next nightfall and the potential for treachery at every roadside inn.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored holy relic, was a test of his faith and his endurance, a testament to the relentless spirit of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, was far from simple.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the constant threat of equipment malfunction were all part of the everyday challenges.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a stark reminder of the human fragility in the face of cosmic wonder.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding new life, fueled her and her crew on this interstellar voyage.
