
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags as I ride across the sun-baked plains of France, heading towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Each creak of the saddle, each snort of my weary horse, is a testament to the arduous journey.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispered tales of monstrous beasts in the untamed lands ahead fuel my apprehension, but the lure of discovery, the hope of uncovering forgotten secrets, keeps me pressing onward. The unknown stretches before me, a tapestry woven with peril and possibility.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we navigate the swirling nebula of Xylos. My mission: to secure a rare mineral crucial for sustaining life on Kepler-186f. The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the alien landscapes of each planet we encounter a stark reminder of humanity's fragile position in the cosmos.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable heart of the galaxy, a constant tension between exploration and survival in a universe teeming with wonders and dangers beyond human comprehension.
