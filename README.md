
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant sultan.  Each creak of the saddle, each harsh cry of a hawk overhead, was a heartbeat in the symphony of her perilous journey.  Bandits, disease, and the sheer vastness of the unknown threatened to swallow her whole, yet the fire of purpose burned brighter than any fear.  The sun beat down, painting the sky in hues of blood orange as she pushed onward, her destiny a shimmering mirage on the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic vistas.   Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were but minor inconveniences compared to the potential dangers awaiting on the planet below—uncharted alien ecosystems and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile lifeforms. Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to forge a new future amongst the stars, fuelled her unwavering resolve.
