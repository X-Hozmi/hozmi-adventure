
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the afternoon sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Ardennes forest, promised both peril and untold riches.  Rumors of a lost monastery, overflowing with ancient texts and gold, had drawn him from his manor, leaving behind the mundane duties of knighthood for the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the wild beckoned, a potent mix of danger and the intoxicating allure of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting rival corporations'  privateers, and facing the potential hostility of a new alien civilization, Eva knew the risks were immense. Yet, the thrill of charting the unmapped expanse of the cosmos far outweighed the fear, promising a reward not just for humankind but for her own thirst for the unknown.
