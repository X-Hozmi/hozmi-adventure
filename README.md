
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage for healing, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested her strength and resilience, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every sunrise, a fierce determination burned brighter than the morning star, fueling her onward through the harsh beauty of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst colossal cosmic wonders.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, was risky, a treacherous leap across light-years of unpredictable space.  Nebula storms threatened to shred her ship, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept her crew on high alert.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to build a life beyond the confines of a dying Earth, made the unimaginable journey worthwhile.
