
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Elara’s worn leather boots crunched on frozen mud.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered of in hushed tones, had taken her through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked plains. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets kept her spurred onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and discovery.  The creak of her pack mule was a comforting sound in the vast, echoing loneliness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony was a daily struggle, but the potential reward – a breakthrough that could change the fate of humanity – outweighed the risks.  The vast, inky blackness of space was a breathtaking yet terrifying canvas, each star a potential destination, each jump into hyperspace a gamble with fate.
