
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small band of travelers pressed onward. Their journey from Canterbury to Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager provisions in dusty villages, and relying on the goodwill (or fear) of strangers for shelter.  Their quest for the mythical Sunstone fueled their determination, pushing them further despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, his starship leaping across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Navigating through asteroid fields and nebulae was child's play compared to the political minefield of intergalactic trade.  The precious Xylos crystals, their cargo, were worth a king's ransom – but attracting unwanted attention from space pirates was an ever-present risk.  Rexx, however, had a reputation as a skilled pilot and even better negotiator, ready to face any challenge the vastness of space threw at him.
