
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whisper of legend fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain wilderness.  The journey demanded resilience, cunning, and a heart unafraid of the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through the swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of hyperspace were ever-present – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling whispers of void-born entities. Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the immense, unexplored darkness. Yet, the hope of finding her lost compatriots pushed her to explore the unimaginable vastness of space, embracing the adventure that stretched beyond the stars.
