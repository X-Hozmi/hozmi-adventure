
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Avignon, led him through treacherous forests haunted by bandits and across unforgiving mountain passes where the air thinned and the wind howled like a banshee. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager rations in hostile villages, and constantly watching for the telltale glint of enemy armor.  The journey was as much a test of faith as it was of endurance.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  Navigating through asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and repairing warp drive malfunctions were daily occurrences. The vast emptiness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a chilling solitude, a constant reminder of the fragile nature of their ship and the immense distances separating them from home.  The universe was a breathtaking, deadly playground, and Eva was determined to conquer it.
