
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains of Castile in fiery hues.  Her journey to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a tapestry woven from the camaraderie of fellow pilgrims, the breathtaking beauty of untamed landscapes, and the unwavering hope of reaching her sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task demanding not only unparalleled piloting skill but also nerves of steel to navigate asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes. The vast, star-dusted canvas of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to hyperspace a gamble, each new planet a breathtaking revelation teeming with alien life and the promise of untold discoveries.
