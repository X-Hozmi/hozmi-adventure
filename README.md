
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both beast and rider tumbling, and the ever-present gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, fueling her with a thirst for the unknown that outweighed every hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The shimmering gas clouds hid countless dangers – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space.  The vast emptiness of interstellar travel was a different kind of hardship, a lonely battle against the suffocating immensity of the cosmos, but the potential reward – a lifeline to a distant world – spurred her on across the uncharted expanse.
