
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains were less daunting than the rumour of a lost city, a fabled place said to hold the secrets of alchemists.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the adventure, a constant dance between hope and the very real danger of the medieval world.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were everyday occurrences in the vast expanse of the galaxy. The thrill wasn't just the exploration of uncharted planets, but the camaraderie forged amongst her crew, the breathtaking vistas of alien landscapes, and the constant challenge of pushing the boundaries of human exploration in the face of the unknown.
