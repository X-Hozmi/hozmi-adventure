
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for adventure – or disaster – in this unforgiving land.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate hope against the backdrop of a brutal but breathtaking world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the perils of uncharted space.  Nebula storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were just a few of the challenges facing her crew. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery in the vast, uncaring beauty of the universe, fueled their daring expedition.
