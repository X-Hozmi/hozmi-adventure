
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the long grass, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of salvation spurred her onward, her resolve hardening with each mile closer to the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking vista of cosmic dust and vibrant gases. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Sol Federation.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble – unpredictable wormholes and the constant threat of pirate attacks were occupational hazards. But the potential rewards – rare minerals, lucrative contracts, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories – fueled her intrepid spirit and that of her crew as they navigated the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
