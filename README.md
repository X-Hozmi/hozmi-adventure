
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged along the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients, had already claimed two pack mules and tested the limits of her endurance.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely obstacles on a path paved with unwavering determination.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each sunset a grim reminder of the vastness of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor"  Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Serpent's Kiss*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, had been harrowing, a near-miss with a rogue asteroid field leaving the ship's shields flickering.  But the allure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories amongst the stars, outweighed the peril.  Ahead lay a planet teeming with possibilities – the chance to discover new life, unlock ancient secrets hidden across light-years, and etch his name into the annals of galactic exploration.
