
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery hidden deep within the Pyrenees, said to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles compared to the hope burning in her heart.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and the unwavering determination of a sister's love.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the existential dread of interstellar travel were commonplace.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, but Eva, driven by the faint hope of finding survivors, pressed onward, a lone star charting a course through the infinite darkness.
