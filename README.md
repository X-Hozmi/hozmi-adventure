
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Provence, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, holds the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her arduous journey, pushing her to the limits of her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust', hurtling through the nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a daring intergalactic rescue mission to retrieve a vital scientist stranded on Kepler-186f.  Warp speed jumps punctuate the endless expanse of space, each one a gamble against unforeseen cosmic anomalies.  Alien encounters, both hostile and benevolent, test her crew's mettle as they navigate the treacherous currents of galactic politics and the unknown wonders of unexplored planets, all for the sake of a mission that could save countless lives.
