
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to find a rumored haven from the creeping plague. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and promise – bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on this perilous pilgrimage.  The journey was a tapestry woven with fear and determination, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from her home.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was routine, but the loneliness of interstellar travel pressed heavily.  Yet, the thought of establishing a new human foothold among the stars, of discovering new life and expanding the boundaries of knowledge, fueled her onward.  This was not merely travel; it was a voyage into the very heart of the unknown, a grand adventure amongst the breathtaking vastness of space.
