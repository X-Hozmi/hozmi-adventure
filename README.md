
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the hill, their worn leather boots already heavy with mud from weeks of relentless travel.  Ahead stretched the unforgiving expanse of the Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the plague ravaging their homeland. Every creak of their saddles, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both danger and the hope of salvation.  The path was perilous, but the reward might just be worth the risk.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, flung across a vast gulf of space from their homeworld.  Warp drives hummed, the ship a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of the cosmos.  Alien landscapes, strange and beautiful, flashed across their sensors – nebulae painted across the darkness, planets glittering like jewels. The journey was long and fraught with the unpredictable hazards of hyperspace, but the hope of finding a lost civilization fuelled her crew’s determination.
