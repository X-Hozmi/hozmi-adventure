
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's weary band crested the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering distantly across the sun-baked Provençal plains. Their journey from the frozen north had been arduous, a tapestry woven with skirmishes against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each day brought new challenges:  fording icy rivers, bartering for meager supplies in desolate villages, and navigating by the unreliable guidance of a tattered map.  Yet, the lure of the Pope's court, and the whispered promise of fortune and glory, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous currents of spacetime, dodging asteroid fields larger than entire planets, and battling unpredictable gravitational forces were all in a day's work.   Communication was spotty, supplies dwindling, and the ever-present threat of pirates and cosmic anomalies loomed large. But the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance, fueled her unwavering determination.
