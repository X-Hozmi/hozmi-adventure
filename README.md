
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Her worn leather satchel holds a precious map, a guide to a rumored monastery holding the lost texts of Hildegard.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise bringing new challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of whether she will ever reach her destination. The thrill of the unknown, however, fuels her onward, a potent elixir stronger than fear itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is a daily routine, but the true danger lies in the uncharted nebulae, where unknown celestial phenomena and potentially hostile alien species lurk.  The breathtaking beauty of nebulae painted across the cosmos provides a stark contrast to the ever-present tension of interstellar travel, a captivating mix of awe and apprehension driving Ryla and her crew towards the promise of new discoveries and unimaginable worlds.
