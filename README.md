
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her frostbitten hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving expanse of the medieval world.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of the cosmos holds both wonder and danger – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failures.  Yet, with each jump to hyperspace, Jax pushes the boundaries of human exploration, driven by an insatiable thirst for discovery and the hope of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
