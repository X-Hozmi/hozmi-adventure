
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a brutal, beautiful backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, blizzards, and treacherous terrain were but minor inconveniences in her quest; the whispers of magic and forgotten empires fueled her every step across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new brush with fate in this land teeming with both peril and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating nebulae and avoiding rogue asteroid fields was a daily routine, punctuated by the thrill of discovering uncharted planets.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, sought not gold, but knowledge—the secrets of alien civilizations, the mysteries of dark matter, and the very origins of the universe.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, yet the allure of the unexplored beckoned them further into the cosmic expanse.
