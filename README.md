
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their worn leather boots crunching on frozen mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost artifact of the Sun King.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless gnawing of hunger, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, tempered by the grim reality of their perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the Kepler-186f colony, a perilous journey across uncharted sectors teeming with space pirates and unpredictable celestial phenomena.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and danger, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.
