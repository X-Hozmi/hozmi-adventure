
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the pale sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a forest primeval, promising peril and adventure in equal measure.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were all part of the journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, a quest fuelled by whispers of lost magic and untold riches.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of excitement, or perhaps, a swift and brutal end.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of hyperspace anomalies, pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space.  But the allure of discovery, of charting unknown worlds and finding new life, propelled her forward, a lone voyager in a cosmic sea of stars.
