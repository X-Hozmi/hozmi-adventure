
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust along the rutted track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new landscape – treacherous mountain passes, whispering forests teeming with unseen dangers, and unforgiving deserts that tested their endurance to the limit.  Every mile brought them closer to their goal, but also closer to the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations for slower vessels.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders and hidden dangers.  Nebulae painted vibrant canvases across the black void, while rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies posed constant threats to their fragile vessel.  The journey was a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of the engines and the ever-present hum of the comms system, connecting her to a vast network of explorers pushing the boundaries of known space.
