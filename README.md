
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope for salvation spurred him on, making even the most arduous journey worthwhile.  The road ahead remained long and uncertain, but the knight's spirit was unbroken.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive engaged, leaping across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, potentially harboring survivors of a long-forgotten war.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding hostile alien patrols tested her skill and courage, demanding split-second decisions under unimaginable pressure. The sheer scale of the cosmos, both breathtaking and terrifying, emphasized the isolation and profound risk of her solitary journey. But the faint hope of finding life, even amidst the cold expanse of space, ignited a fire in her heart, propelling her forward into the uncharted darkness.
