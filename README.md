
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a miraculous healing balm.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unpredictable whims of nature.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of a cure for her ailing brother, fueled her onward, even as fear gnawed at her courage.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the vastness of the cosmos remained terrifyingly immense.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, alien leviathans lurked in the void, and the loneliness of interstellar space pressed heavily on her crew.  But the thrill of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, ignited an unwavering fire within her.
