
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking slightly into the muddied track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost key to a powerful ancient magic.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the glory that awaited its discoverer, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The journey spanned light-years, a perilous voyage fraught with asteroid fields, unpredictable space anomalies, and the ever-present danger of pirate attacks.  But the promise of a new life for the colonists, and the vast, unexplored wonders of the galaxy, fueled her determination to complete this interstellar odyssey.
