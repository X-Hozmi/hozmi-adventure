
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the fetid air of the besieged castle he'd just left.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Whisperwind Mountains, where a relic of immense power was said to be hidden.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the sense of peril and unknown wonders that lay ahead on this perilous journey across a land riddled with bandit trails and untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast distances between civilizations – and the incredible technology bridging those gaps.  The cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colors and distant galaxies, a stark contrast to the cramped confines of her ship.  Her journey was a race against rival explorers and the unpredictable dangers of interstellar space.
