
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, a testament to countless revisions and hastily drawn additions, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of untold power.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the allure of the unknown, of pushing past the known world's edges, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years instead of leagues.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with dying stars and nascent planets, held both wonder and peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and the constant hum of the warp drive were the trials of a different age, yet the spirit of adventure remained unchanged.  The search for new worlds, new technologies, and the promise of discovery fueled her voyage across the galaxy, a journey as perilous and exhilarating as any undertaken by her medieval ancestors.
