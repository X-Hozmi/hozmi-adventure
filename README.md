
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, push onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, has tested their endurance.  Days melt into weeks, marked by the rhythmic clop of horses' hooves, the shared bread and meager stew, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowy forests.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the constant gnawing hunger, all tempered by the camaraderie forged in hardship and the unwavering faith that fuels their quest.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-abandoned research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.   Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of solar flares demand unwavering focus and skill, a stark contrast to the quiet heroism of medieval journeys, yet fueled by the same spirit of exploration and the pursuit of the unknown.
