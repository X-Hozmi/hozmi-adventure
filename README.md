
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel, heavy with herbs and meager supplies, swung with each labored step.  Ahead lay the rumored monastery of Saint Jude, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Robbers, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the unwavering hope for her brother's life fueled her onward, each sunrise a new chapter in her perilous journey across the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, offered breathtaking beauty, but also harbored unknown dangers.  Cosmic storms, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyage. Yet, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, a chance to build a future amongst the stars, drove her and her crew ever forward.
