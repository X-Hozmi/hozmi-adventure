
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots crunching on frozen mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation were their constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a renewed hope, a fragile flame against the backdrop of a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the breathtaking spectacle unfolded before her. The mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps across light-years, navigating asteroid fields, and the constant hum of the ship's engine were the realities of her interstellar voyage. The ultimate challenge, however, wasn't the vast distances, but the unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted sectors of space.
