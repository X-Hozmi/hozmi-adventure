
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his destrier onward.  The setting sun painted the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple, a fitting backdrop to his perilous journey.  He carried a king's ransom – and a king's secret – sewn into the lining of his saddlebag, pursued by ruthless mercenaries and shadowed by the ever-present threat of bandits and forest wolves.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for death or glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had already claimed weeks, months even, blurring into a timeless odyssey punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the occasional blip on her navigation console, signalling potential threats lurking in the void – rogue asteroids, space pirates, or the terrifying unknown.  The reward for her daring voyage? A legendary artifact said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize worth risking everything to obtain.
