
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of pack mules and weary men, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as we navigated treacherous mountain passes and forded raging rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits a chilling companion.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes, but also the potential for ambushes, disease, and the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead.  Our quest: to reach the legendary city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril but rich with the allure of the unknown.


Millennia later, the *Stardust Drifter* sliced through the inky black, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her crew across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy, charting unexplored nebulae and dodging rogue asteroid fields.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, a legendary source of energy said to hold the key to galactic peace – a prize worth the unimaginable risks of traversing the unforgiving void.
