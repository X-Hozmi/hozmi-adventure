
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes, the threat of bandits a constant companion.  Each sunrise brings new challenges:  fording icy rivers, bartering with suspicious villagers, and constantly scanning the landscape for signs of danger.  The promise of Constantinople, a city of glittering spires and untold riches, fuels our weary steps, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, the stars are our wilderness.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hums softly as I navigate the nebula of Cygnus X-1, the vibrant colours a breathtaking contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the navigation console.  Each jump across hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  We chase whispers of ancient civilizations and long-lost technologies, traversing galaxies far beyond human comprehension. The thrill of discovery, however, outweighs the inherent risks; the universe holds mysteries far more captivating than any medieval kingdom.
