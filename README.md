
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her worn map clutched tightly in her calloused hand.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and wonder.  Robbers, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  The relentless sun beat down, but the lure of adventure burned brighter.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids was a constant test of skill and courage. The vast, inky expanse of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation, a stark contrast to the earthy challenges of the medieval traveler, yet the allure of discovery remained the same, a driving force that pushed her onward into the unknown.
