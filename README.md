
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a battered map, its parchment brittle with age, promising riches beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, but the lure of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, pushed him relentlessly across the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril or unexpected fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, though safer than Thomas’s, held its own brand of adventure.  Navigation through asteroid fields, skirmishes with pirate fleets, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive were all part of the routine. But the possibility of discovering new life, new civilizations, fueled her crew's relentless pursuit of the unknown, echoing the spirit of medieval adventurers who dared to explore their own world.
