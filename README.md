
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel containing little more than dried meat and a chipped map.  The whispers of the Black Death follow her like a phantom, but the lure of the legendary lost city of Ys pulls her onward.  Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog, each flicker of movement in the long grass holds the promise of danger or discovery, making this arduous journey a desperate gamble against fate itself.  The shimmering heat haze blurs the horizon, mirroring the uncertain path ahead.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexa "Ryker" Vance pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across lightyears, she navigates treacherous asteroid fields and dodges the predatory warships of the Kryll Hegemony. The vast, inky canvas of space is both breathtaking and terrifying, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown. The quest for these crystals is a race against time and powerful enemies, a cosmic adventure fueled by both ambition and a thirst for the uncharted.
