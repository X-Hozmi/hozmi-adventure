
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, the gnawing hunger in his belly.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the unpredictable, pushed him forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the distant colony on Kepler-186f.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies, held a different kind of peril.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  But the vastness of the galaxy, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fuelled her determination, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the cosmos.
