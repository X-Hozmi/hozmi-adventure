The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, a map clutched tightly in his sweat-stained hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled his perilous journey across the kingdom. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were small price to pay for the glory – and perhaps the fortune – that awaited him at journey's end.  Each creak of saddle leather and rumble of his horse's hooves was a beat in the symphony of his grand adventure.


Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, light years beyond charted space.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.  Ahead lay the unknown, the thrill of discovery tempered by the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering unforeseen technological failures.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even her intrepid spirit.
