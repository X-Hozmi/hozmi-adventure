
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a tattered map, its lines smudged with sweat and rain, leading him towards the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in taverns and sung by wandering minstrels.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of untold riches and legendary artifacts said to lie within its walls.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the stark reminder of the vast and unforgiving landscape still stretching before him.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. The journey was a symphony of stars, a breathtaking ballet of celestial bodies.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging cosmic radiation bursts, and repairing warp drive malfunctions were all part of a typical day’s work for a galactic explorer.  The potential discovery of new life, however, outweighed every risk, fueling her insatiable thirst for the unknown and promising a reward far greater than any medieval treasure.
