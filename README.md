
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creaking cart and passing knight represented a potential ally or enemy in her quest to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the relentless sun threatened to sap her strength, but the unwavering image of her brother fueled her onward. The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward outweighed the risk.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the iridescent nebulae outside blurring into streaks of impossible color.  His freighter, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled across the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way, bound for a distant planet rumored to harbor a rare energy source capable of powering the dying Sol system.  Pirates were a constant threat in these uncharted territories, and navigating treacherous wormholes demanded nerves of steel.  The riches promised by this perilous journey, however, were a gamble worth taking for Rexx and his crew.
