
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule train as it snaked across the sun-baked plains of Iberia.  Her worn leather map, crisscrossed with faded ink, was her only guide to the rumored city of gold hidden beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant companions on this arduous journey, testing her courage and resourcefulness at every turn.  The whispers of ancient magic and forgotten empires fueled her onward, a potent elixir against the ever-present weariness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust Drifter* hurtled through the void, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a swirling nebula.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the glittering dust of a million dying stars.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms were commonplace hazards, yet the thrill of discovery, the potential for first contact, overshadowed the risks.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, fueled her insatiable thirst for exploration, a legacy inherited from the medieval adventurers who had dared to dream of distant shores.
