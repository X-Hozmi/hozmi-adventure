
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried figs and a map, its edges frayed from countless folds.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a fabled haven said to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, a destination promising both glory and peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the challenges that lay between her and her goal, a testament to the bravery and resilience needed to survive a medieval journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the crimson nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates was a daily struggle.  Yet, the potential discovery of new life, the thrill of charting unmapped territories across the cosmos, fueled her and her crew, showcasing the audacious spirit of interstellar exploration in a future where the universe itself was the ultimate frontier.
