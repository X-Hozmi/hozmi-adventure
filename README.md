
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the sacred city a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.  Every ford crossed, every mountain pass conquered, was a testament to her resilience and unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre, alien lifeforms were merely routine hazards.  The true challenge lay in the isolation, the crushing weight of the vastness of space, and the persistent gnawing doubt that the colony even survived. Yet, the hope of finding her lost family – and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration – propelled her forward, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
