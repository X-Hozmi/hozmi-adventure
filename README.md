
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her tired horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled her nostrils, a stark contrast to the rumors of bandit raids and plague-ridden villages that whispered along her route.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, fueling her onward despite the daunting journey ahead across treacherous mountains and unforgiving rivers.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vastness of the cosmos, the alien landscapes glimpsed through her viewport, filled her with a sense of awe and dread.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, every unexplored system a potential graveyard. But the faintest hope of finding survivors, of answering the silent plea of a lost civilization, drove her across unimaginable distances.
