
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for a vital trade with the distant city of Porthaven.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the unknown dangers lurking in the shadow of the peaks – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown spurred her onward, fueled by the promise of a better life for her people.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far-flung planet of Aethelred, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by sentient energy beings.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of exploration, the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars, overshadowed any fear, making the vast, unforgiving expanse of space his ultimate playground.
