
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's pardon, a forged letter of safe conduct, and a desperate hope.  His journey from the shadowed forests of Bavaria to the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in every wood, feuding lords controlled every pass, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a prayer for survival, as he pursued a mythical cure for his ailing sister across the treacherous tapestry of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light years away across the treacherous void.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering alien languages were just some of the challenges.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies contrasting with the ever-present risk of engine failure or hostile encounters. The fate of her crew, and perhaps even the galaxy, rested on her ability to complete this perilous interstellar voyage.
