
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, a stark contrast to the verdant forests left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled him forward, a single knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate incursions were commonplace hazards, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held untold wonders and unimaginable dangers.  Eva, however, was driven by humanity's thirst for discovery, ready to face any cosmic storm to reach the new frontier.
