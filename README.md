
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating unfamiliar terrain, bartering for supplies in strange villages, and facing the constant weariness of the road.  Yet, the glint of distant castles and the camaraderie forged on shared hardship fueled their onward push.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The journey was a tapestry woven from the hum of the Alcubierre drive, the crackle of subspace comms, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue solar flares.  But the vastness of space held a beauty unmatched by any earthly landscape, and the thought of bringing life and hope to a new world spurred her onward.
