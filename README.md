
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the weight of his mission heavy on his shoulders.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, and the desperate hope for his people, fueled his relentless journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, but they'd made it – on the edge of the uncharted Andromeda galaxy, hunting for the legendary Xylos crystals rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was a terrifying beauty, a constant reminder of the fragility of their ship and the immense challenges ahead in their search for this potentially galaxy-altering treasure.
