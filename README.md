
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, famished wolves, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, a quest whispered in hushed tones by wandering merchants.  The rough-hewn roads, barely more than trails, tested her resilience, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Galaxies spiraled past like cosmic brushstrokes, each a potential destination in her vast, ever-expanding cartography. This wasn't a quest for gold or glory, but for knowledge – the secrets held within the newly-discovered Xylos system.  Despite the sophisticated technology, the dangers were real; rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors could mean the difference between discovery and oblivion.  The journey was perilous, but the potential rewards immeasurable.
