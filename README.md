
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track snaked through the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down mercilessly on his already parched throat.  His quest: to reach the legendary City of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the allure of the unknown pushed him relentlessly forward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and troubleshooting the ship’s temperamental hyperdrive were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space held both incredible beauty and terrifying dangers, but the hope of finding a new home for humanity, and the thrill of charting uncharted territories among the stars, fueled her unwavering spirit.
