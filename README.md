
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his plague-stricken village.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fueled his journey, transforming each hardship into a step closer to his desperate goal. The whispered tales of Eldoria, of shimmering towers and healing waters, spurred him onward through the unforgiving landscape of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates were daily occurrences, the vast, inky blackness of space a constant reminder of the sheer scale of her undertaking.  The galaxy stretched before her, a tapestry of wonders and dangers, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting humanity to a wider cosmos, drove her across the light-years.
