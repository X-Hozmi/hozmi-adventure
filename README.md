
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  The road was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring rains, and whispers of the Black Death chilled her more than the evening air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of healing fueled her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f colony.  The jump to hyperspace had been brutal, the G-forces pressing her into her command chair, but the breathtaking sight of the nebula was a worthy reward.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony, a journey fraught with its own dangers – pirate incursions, unpredictable space weather, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness between stars.  Each jump was a gamble, but the lives of the colonists were worth the risk.
