
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits lurking in shadowy forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope, fuelled by sibling devotion, kept her spurred onward, each sunrise a promise of drawing closer to her life's desperate gamble.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The vibrant colours of nebulous clouds painted her viewscreen as she charted a course to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony for humanity.  Unlike the medieval treks of her ancestors, her journey was measured in light-years, the dangers cosmic rather than terrestrial.  Asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters were just some of the perils she faced in her quest to expand human civilization into the uncharted vastness of space.
