The sun beat down on the dusty track, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a distant memory as he ventured deeper into the untamed wilds.

Facing the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the ever-present danger of asteroid fields, and the possibility of encountering unknown alien life, Eva's journey was a testament to human courage and the relentless pursuit of knowledge across the cosmic ocean.
