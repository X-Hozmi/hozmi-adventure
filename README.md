
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious seeds destined for a monastery nestled high in the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure: bandits lurking in shadowed passes, the sudden storm that could sweep her from the path, or the unexpected kindness of a humble villager offering meager sustenance.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to human resilience in a time when travel itself was an act of daring.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing the ship's failing hyperdrive were all in a day's work. The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered thrills and perils unlike any Elara could have imagined, a testament to human ambition pushing beyond the limitations of a single world, venturing into the endless cosmic frontier.
