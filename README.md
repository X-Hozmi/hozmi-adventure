Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier on his journey to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Rumors of untold riches and powerful magic fueled his quest, outweighing the very real dangers of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or death.

The challenges were not bandits or mountains, but radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of system failure. Yet, the promise of discovery and the potential for a new beginning fueled her relentless journey across the cosmos.
