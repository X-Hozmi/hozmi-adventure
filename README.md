
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I crested the hill, the biting wind whipping at my cloak. Before me stretched the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Carpathian Mountains, a formidable barrier between me and my destination: Constantinople.  Each step was a gamble; bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, and the unforgiving terrain threatened broken bones and worse.  Yet, the lure of the East, of exotic spices and untold riches, spurred me onward, fueled by a thirst for adventure that dwarfed the gnawing hunger in my belly.  This journey, fraught with peril, was a pilgrimage to the unknown, a testament to the human spirit’s relentless pursuit of the extraordinary.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones.  Gazing out at the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking tapestry of colours unimaginable on Earth, I felt a thrill almost identical to that medieval ancestor of mine.  Instead of bandits, I faced the unpredictable whims of warp currents; instead of treacherous mountains, the vast, empty gulf between galaxies.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the answers to humanity’s deepest questions about life beyond our solar system. This interstellar voyage, while technologically advanced, carried the same weight of uncertainty, the same potent mix of fear and exhilaration that has driven explorers through the ages.
