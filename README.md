
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and even more unimaginable dangers.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, starvation gnawed at the edges of his resolve, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the glint of gold in his dreams fueled his weary legs, promising adventure far beyond the confines of his humble village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a heartbeat of a journey filled with both terror and thrilling anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising new resources for a dwindling Earth.  The vast expanse of space held its own perils; rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids on interstellar trade routes.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of a new world, outweighed the risks.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby to the vast unknown, a soundtrack to a journey stretching across the unimaginable distances between stars, a quest for survival and expansion among the cosmos.
