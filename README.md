
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each strained breath of her weary mount, echoed the perilous journey ahead.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient healing arts, fueled her relentless trek.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both her and her faithful beast.  Yet, the whispered promise of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the vast, dark wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Corvus piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the unknown – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving expanse of space.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding life beyond humanity's reach, burned brighter than any star in the vast, inky cosmos.
