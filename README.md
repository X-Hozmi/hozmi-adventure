
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, fueled her apprehension and excitement in equal measure.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant threats, yet the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, her heart pounding a rhythm as wild and untamed as the landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of celestial fire painting the cockpit windows.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold scientific breakthroughs and possibly, new forms of life.  Faster-than-light travel masked the immense distances, but the constant threat of pirate attacks and unpredictable spatial anomalies kept the crew on edge.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the perils and potential rewards of their interstellar voyage.
