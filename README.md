
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the fading light, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey across the treacherous highlands, a pilgrimage to a rumored holy shrine, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested their mettle.  But the whispers of miraculous healing, the promise of a glimpse of the divine, fueled their relentless pursuit across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the ship's controls.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps were risky, the unknown a constant companion, but the potential discovery of new life forms and advanced technology overshadowed the inherent danger.  The vast emptiness of space held both terror and untold wonders, pushing Eva and her crew to the very limits of human endurance and ingenuity.
