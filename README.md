
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the muddy track, the biting wind a constant companion. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging Reginald's village.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are their constant foes, but the unwavering hope for a cure, and the thrill of the unknown, spurs them onward. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a testament to their resilience in this perilous medieval journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess vital technological advancements capable of saving her dying planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging hostile pirate ships, and facing the terrifying unknowns of uncharted nebulae are all in a day’s work.  The infinite possibilities of space, the weight of her responsibility, and the ever-present hum of the hyperdrive engine fuel her journey across the cosmos, a journey far removed from the muddy tracks of Reginald's time, yet equally perilous and breathtaking.
