
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary steps across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos. Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  Hyperspace jumps brought them across unimaginable distances, but the dangers were equally cosmic: rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of navigational errors that could strand them in the cold emptiness of space.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding new homes amongst the stars, propelled them forward.
