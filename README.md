
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, and the hope it offered, spurred her onward through the perilous landscapes of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* cut a swathe through the nebula, its engines humming a lullaby of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human civilization.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic anomalies and rogue asteroids; instead of starvation, the ever-present risk of system failure. But the vast, unexplored cosmos, brimming with the promise of new worlds and unimaginable wonders, beckoned her across the light years.
