
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering forests of Ardennes.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on his perilous journey across the vast and unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  Ahead lay the Andromeda Galaxy, a swirling nebula of untold wonders and unimaginable dangers.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the newly discovered Xylos system.  The vast distances between star systems, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders presented challenges far exceeding any faced by medieval travelers, demanding courage, skill, and a deep understanding of the cosmos to navigate the treacherous pathways of interstellar space.
