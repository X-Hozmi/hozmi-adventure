
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône valley, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the crisp air.  Her journey to Avignon, to plead her brother's case before the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Bandit lords lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of the Black Death followed her like a shroud. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against starvation, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  The road itself was her only constant companion, a ribbon of hope stretching towards an uncertain future.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engine.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with undiscovered life forms and equally perilous alien fauna.  Warp jumps across galaxies were commonplace, yet the existential dread of navigating uncharted space, facing unknown threats, and the ever-present chance of catastrophic engine failure remained a constant.  His journey was a race against time, a daring gamble against the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.
