
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, to find a lost brother rumored to be serving in the Papal court, had been fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the roads treacherous, and the nights spent shivering under a meager cloak, the only company the mournful howl of wolves. Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the hope of reunion and the chilling tales of the Black Death spreading across the land – a fate she prayed to outrun.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos reflecting in the viewport of his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a treacherous dance with gravity wells and rogue asteroids, a constant battle against the wear and tear of interstellar travel.  But Jaxx, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and the weight of his duty, pressed onward, the cold vastness of space a thrilling and terrifying testament to humanity's unending quest for the unknown.
