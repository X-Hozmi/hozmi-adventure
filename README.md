
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and maps.  The scent of woodsmoke and impending storm hung in the air, a fitting accompaniment to her perilous journey to the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of untold riches and forgotten knowledge that beckoned from the western horizon. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant song.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's burgeoning interstellar empire.  The vastness of space, speckled with swirling gas clouds and the distant light of uncountable stars, dwarfed even the grandest medieval expeditions. Yet, the same primal human thirst for discovery pulsed within her, a shared legacy driving both Elara and Ryla across the boundaries of their worlds.
