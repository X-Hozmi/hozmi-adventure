
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the sense of peril and adventure.  Bandits, disease, and the sheer unpredictability of the landscape are constant companions on her journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and the thrill of the unknown, a journey where every sunrise brings a new challenge and every sunset a breathtaking vista.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of space remains both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from a long-lost alien civilization on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous quest fraught with the dangers of hostile alien lifeforms and the ever-present threat of mechanical failure in the inky black.
