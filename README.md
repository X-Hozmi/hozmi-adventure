
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings and unimaginable riches.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of adventure beyond the confines of his tiny village, spurred him on, a single flickering candle against the vast, dark landscape of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The journey was a constant dance with cosmic hazards – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien life. But the breathtaking beauty of nebulae painted across the void, the thrill of discovering new worlds, and the boundless potential of the cosmos fueled her intrepid spirit, a tiny ship against the vast, glittering ocean of space.
