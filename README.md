
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the packhorse behind him.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – this journey was far more dangerous than any tournament.  Survival meant navigating treacherous terrain, outsmarting cunning thieves, and perhaps even facing down the supernatural.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out the viewport of her starship, the crimson nebula of Xylos swirling around them. The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy was a risky one, pushing the boundaries of known space.  Her mission: to recover a lost artifact of immeasurable power before the Kryll Hegemony could get their hands on it.  The cosmos, while breathtaking, was a vast and unforgiving expanse;  navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all just part of the day's work for a galactic adventurer.
