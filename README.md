
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret of eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, spurred him on, pushing him deeper into the heart of a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unimaginable distances.  Warp drives hummed, alien landscapes flashed past the viewport, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept her crew on high alert.  But the vastness of space, the mysteries of uncharted planets, and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries fueled her unwavering determination, pushing the boundaries of human exploration to the very edge of the known universe.
