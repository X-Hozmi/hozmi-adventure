
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of pine and the ever-present threat of bandits. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, before the encroaching winter sealed the mountain passes. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the tension, transforming the journey from mere travel into a constant struggle for survival against the harsh elements and unseen dangers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant cosmic dust painted the viewport in breathtaking hues, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering unknown alien life forms, she pressed onward, driven by a sense of duty and the hope of finding survivors amidst the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
