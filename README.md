
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both salvation and peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly-established colony on Kepler-186f.  The vast distances between star systems were a constant challenge, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes. But the real danger wasn't the cosmos itself, but the pirates who preyed on interstellar trade routes, ever watchful for a vulnerable freighter laden with valuable cargo.  The galaxy was a breathtaking expanse, yet every light-year felt like a gamble.
