
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glimmer of hope, the promise of salvation, spurred them onward, their journey a desperate gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the relentless march of death.


Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet said to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Navigation was a constant challenge amidst nebulae and unstable wormholes, and the threat of pirate raids a persistent danger.  But the allure of a new home, a chance to rebuild a shattered civilization, fueled her unwavering determination to complete her perilous, interstellar voyage.
