
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the tattered map guiding her towards the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold the secret to her family's lost fortune.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the ever-present threat of the plague that stalked the land.  The adventure was perilous, but the promise of Eldoria burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a sentient, crystalline lifeform.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with the risk of encountering hostile pirate fleets, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and the constant threat of warp-core malfunctions.  But the scientific potential, the chance to make first contact with an entirely new civilization, outweighed every danger.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held a different kind of peril, but the thrill of discovery was just as intoxicating.
