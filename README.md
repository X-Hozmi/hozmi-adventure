
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, urged his weary mount onward.  Ahead, the treacherous Black Mire promised death by swamp fever or worse – the rumored lair of a monstrous wyvern guarding a hidden monastery said to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the reeds, sent shivers down his spine, a mixture of fear and the exhilarating thrill of the unknown.  His journey, a pilgrimage of atonement and desperate hope, was a tapestry woven with danger and the tantalizing promise of redemption.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a perilous undertaking with a 70% failure rate.  The shimmering, alien landscapes flashing by her viewport were a stark contrast to the sterile hum of her ship, a testament to the vast and awe-inspiring unknown that lay beyond Earth's cradle.  The galaxy was her playground, and every jump into hyperspace was a roll of the cosmic dice.
