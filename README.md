
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a meager supply of dried figs and hardtack, insufficient for the treacherous journey ahead.  Rumors of a hidden monastery nestled in the shadow of the Dragon's Teeth mountains spurred her onward, a pilgrimage fueled by both faith and a desperate need to escape a life of forced servitude.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine – a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through a nebula of iridescent gas, the crimson and gold swirling around her ship like a cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The jump through hyperspace had been brutal, the G-forces a near-fatal squeeze, but the thrill of exploration overshadowed the risks.  Ahead lay the unknown, a galaxy teeming with possibilities, but also with the potential for unforeseen dangers – hostile alien life forms, treacherous gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  The fate of Xylos, and possibly the future of humanity, rested on her shoulders.
