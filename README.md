
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both wonder and peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and whispers of mythical creatures haunted the travelers' tales shared around crackling campfires.  Yet, the promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis rumored to hold untold riches, spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos Cluster was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of intergalactic customs.  The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the tedium.  Each new planet offered a kaleidoscope of alien landscapes, from crimson deserts to methane oceans, each inhabited by life forms stranger and more wondrous than any medieval legend.  The universe, vast and mysterious, beckoned with a promise of endless adventure.
