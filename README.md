
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its creases testament to countless journeys.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the tall grasses, hinted at the dangers that lurked – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispering promises of silks and spices, spurred her onward, a flicker of adventure burning bright against the encroaching night.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship *Stardust* through the nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the controls.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new dawn for humanity, but the journey was fraught with peril.  Asteroid fields threatened to rip her vessel apart, and the unknown dangers of hyperspace travel always loomed.  But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, held firm, her gaze fixed on the distant glimmer of a potential new home, a beacon in the vast, uncaring darkness of space.
