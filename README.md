
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering mass of oxen and weary men, trudges across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies.  Yet, the lure of silks, spices, and whispered tales of unimaginable riches drives us onward, a tapestry of hope woven against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Every creak of the wagon wheel, every rustle in the tall grass, is a potential adventure, a test of our mettle and resolve.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  Nebulae swirl like cosmic paintstrokes, and alien planets, vibrant and hostile, beckon from afar.  The thrill is not just in the journey but in the discovery—uncharted worlds teeming with strange life, forgotten technologies, and the ever-present danger of encountering civilizations far more advanced (or far more primitive) than our own.  The universe is our oyster, brimming with adventure and peril in equal measure.
