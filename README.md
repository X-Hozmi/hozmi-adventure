
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the already hazy horizon.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the far reaches of the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own set of dangers – unpredictable spatial anomalies, pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the constant gnawing loneliness of interstellar space.  But the hope of reuniting with her lost kin, a beacon of familiar warmth in the vast cosmic cold, drove her ever further into the uncharted depths.
