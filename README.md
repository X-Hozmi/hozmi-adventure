
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn map, barely legible after years of use, guides her towards the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the unforgiving landscape tests her resilience at every turn.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager supplies in desolate villages.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the lure of Zerzura, and the thrill of the unknown, pushes her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  He’s on a mission to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey through asteroid fields and unexplored systems teeming with bizarre and potentially hostile alien life.  Faster-than-light travel takes its toll, the warp drive straining against the fabric of spacetime.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, fuels his spirit, making the risks – radiation exposure, potential engine failure, and encounters with unknown entities – worthwhile.  The cosmos stretches before him, a vast and daunting, yet breathtakingly beautiful, playground of adventure.
