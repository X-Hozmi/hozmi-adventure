
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun bleaching the already parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across scorching deserts where mirages mocked her thirst, and over treacherous mountain passes where the wind howled like a banshee. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies, and evading the suspicious eyes of those who saw her, a lone woman, as an easy target. Yet, the whisper of Zerzura's riches and the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals across three galaxies, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying; the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion against the absolute silence.  Navigation relied on complex astrogation charts and gut instinct, dodging rogue asteroids and the ever-present threat of space pirates. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of exploration in the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
