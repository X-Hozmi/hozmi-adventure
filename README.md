
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, yet the glint of Ys's rumored gold spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each sunset a testament to her resilience.  The weight of her pack felt lighter than the weight of her ambition.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and contending with the unpredictable effects of hyperspace travel were child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting him on the other side.  The vastness of space amplified the stakes, making each jump a gamble and each discovery a potential turning point in galactic history.
