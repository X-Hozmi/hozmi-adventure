
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, menacing forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred him on, each hardship forging him into a more resilient, determined traveler.  The whispered legends of Zerzura, along with the longing for adventure, were a compass more reliable than any star.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and new trade routes.  The vastness of space dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, yet the challenges remained the same: navigating treacherous cosmic storms, repairing vital systems under pressure, and battling the loneliness of interstellar travel.  But unlike Thomas, Eva had the power of advanced technology at her disposal – warp drives, automated systems, and a crew of skilled specialists. Still, the thrill of discovery, the irresistible pull of the unknown, burned as brightly in her heart as it had in the heart of the medieval adventurer.
