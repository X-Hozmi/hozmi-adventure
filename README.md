
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravages his homeland. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on his perilous journey, testing not only his physical endurance but also the resilience of his spirit. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps demand unwavering focus and precise skill.  Eva's journey, while technologically advanced, shares a common thread with Sir Reginald's: the unwavering pursuit of a vital goal across vast and dangerous territories, fueled by a courage born of necessity and a deep sense of purpose.
