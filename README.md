
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought fresh peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them on, forging an unbreakable bond between these weary travelers.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unexplored galaxy of Andromeda. Their mission: to locate a new habitable world for a humanity teetering on the brink of extinction.  The vast distances, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms made each jump through hyperspace a gamble. But the survival of their species rested on their success, and the courage to explore the uncharted cosmos burned bright within them.
