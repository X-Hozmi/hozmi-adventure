
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the rumored City of Gold had taken her through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains where bandits lurked, and through dense forests whispering with ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating swirling fog, bartering for scarce supplies in ramshackle villages, and constantly guarding against the ever-present threat of wild animals and thievery.  The allure of untold riches, however, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of cryo-preserved flora to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling temporal distortions, and outwitting rival corporations were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of humanity's audacious reach into the unknown, a journey far more perilous, yet no less thrilling, than any medieval pilgrimage.
