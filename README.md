
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the challenges facing her as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and determination. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, heightened her senses, transforming the ordinary journey into a desperate race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing vital systems during hyperspace jumps were all part of a typical voyage. But this trip held a unique tension; whispers of a powerful, unknown energy source emanating from Kepler-186f fuelled both excitement and apprehension. Eva, along with her diverse crew, braced themselves for the unknown, their journey a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery amidst the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
