
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a few precious coins, and a map – a lifeline in this unpredictable world.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown. But the lure of the fabled city of Alexandria, whispered about in hushed tones, propelled her onward, the promise of adventure and discovery a beacon against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The journey to Kepler-186f had taken months, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the stark beauty of distant galaxies.  Her mission: to establish first contact.  Unlike the medieval adventurers who relied on instinct and luck, Eva possessed advanced technology, yet the unknown remained a formidable adversary. The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of alien life, these presented a unique kind of peril, a cosmic test of courage and ingenuity far removed from the earthly dangers of Elara's era.
