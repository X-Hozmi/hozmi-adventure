
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their packhorse laden with meager supplies,  forged a path through the rain-soaked forests of northern France.  Their quest: to reach the distant abbey of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the secret to curing the Black Death’s grip on their village. Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy copses, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred them onward, their journey a testament to the human spirit's resilience in the face of medieval adversity.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel were just some of the dangers she faced.  Yet, the potential reward – a future where different galactic civilizations could coexist – fueled her drive, making her journey a thrilling exploration of the cosmos and human potential in a far-off future.
