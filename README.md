
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Prague, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease stalk him. Yet, the glint of steel in his eyes and the unwavering set of his jaw speak to a resilience forged in the fires of countless adventures. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed resolve to reach his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of alien worlds are commonplace. The breathtaking vistas of nebulas painted across the inky blackness and the thrill of discovering new, alien lifeforms are the rewards of her perilous voyage.  But the greatest adventure lies in the uncharted territories of space, a realm where the limits of human exploration are constantly pushed.
