
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Each creak of the wooden wheels was a testament to the journey's hardship; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the relentless sun beat down mercilessly.  Their quest, to deliver a sacred relic to a faraway monastery, demanded resilience and unwavering courage.  Every sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the constant threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown spurred them onward, their shared purpose a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with cosmic dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of K'tharr raiders, Eva relied on her wits and the advanced technology of her ship. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the shimmering beauty of distant stars and nebulas, was as breathtaking as it was terrifying.  The potential discovery, however, fuelled her unwavering determination, making the unimaginable distances a worthwhile sacrifice.
