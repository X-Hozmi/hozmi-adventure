
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  The quest for the lost city of Eldoria had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts teeming with bandits, and through dark forests whispering with ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – hungry wolves, swift rivers, and the ever-present threat of rival knights seeking the same legendary treasure. His only companions were the ghosts of his fallen comrades and the unwavering hope of finding Eldoria's fabled riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna and guarded by a hostile alien civilization.  Faster-than-light travel was taxing, the jump from galaxy to galaxy a harrowing leap of faith.  But the galaxy needed that energy, and Eva, ever the seasoned explorer, trusted her crew, her ship, and her instincts to bring them safely home – hopefully, with the energy source intact.
