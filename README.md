
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plateau.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered rumors, guided her towards the legendary City of Brass.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the brutal indifference of nature, but the lure of untold riches and forgotten magic spurred her onward.  The creak of her saddle, the rhythmic thud of her horse's hooves, were the only constants in a world brimming with danger and opportunity.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational clutches of black holes was commonplace.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Arm of Xylos, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast, silent expanse of space was both breathtaking and terrifying; the potential for discovery exhilarating, the risk of annihilation ever-present.  Each jump represented a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
