The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort, but the thrill of reaching the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred him on.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow stretching long and menacing in the fading light, fueled the adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers and untold rewards awaiting him across the unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield but also the hope of glory, a hope that burned brighter than any flickering torch in the encroaching twilight.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light-years from Earth. The journey, fraught with the perils of solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels, was a far cry from the medieval knight's struggles, but the same spirit of adventure pulsed through her veins.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, filled with wonder and potential catastrophe in equal measure, offered a challenge as thrilling, and arguably more perilous, than any medieval quest.  The stars were her guide, and the future, her prize.
