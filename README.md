
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wheel, each raven's cry, promises both peril and wonder. We've faced bandits, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and bartered with nomadic tribes for meager supplies.  The legend of Zerzura, a city of gold and untold riches, fuels our journey, a shimmering beacon in a world of hardship.

Centuries later, the Althea, a starship forged of starlight and dreams, cuts through the inky blackness of interstellar space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life beyond our own.  The hum of the engines is a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast silence punctuated only by the crackling of subspace comms.  We navigate asteroid fields, dodge solar flares, and grapple with the ever-present threat of hull breaches.  The journey is fraught with technological challenges and the lonely vastness of space, but the promise of discovery, of encountering another civilization, keeps us pushing forward.
