
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that swirled around them like phantom spirits.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic capable of ending a devastating plague.  Each day brought new challenges; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it offered, spurred them on through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  Instead of bandits, she faced the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel. Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. Yet, the responsibility to her people, the chance to forge a future among the stars, propelled her forward, her ship a tiny vessel against the infinite backdrop of the cosmos.
