
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across the treacherous mountain pass was far from over; bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any mountain. Yet, the whispered legends of a hidden monastery, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother, fueled her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rocky step, was a step closer to hope, a testament to the unyielding spirit of a medieval adventurer.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts were unreliable, and the vastness of space, peppered with rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes, presented a constant challenge. But Eva, hardened by years traversing the galaxy's treacherous routes, felt a thrill coursing through her veins – the exhilaration of exploration that drove her and her crew across the infinite canvas of the cosmos, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
