
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death were less frightening than the allure of Constantinople, a city shimmering with exotic promise on the far horizon. Each creaking wagon wheel, each shared campfire story with weary travelers, fueled her intrepid spirit.  She sought not gold, but knowledge – the lost scrolls of a forgotten alchemist rumored to be hidden within the city's ancient walls.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a rumored paradise planet teeming with unknown life forms, was a risky one,  but the potential discovery of a new energy source – the Xylos Crystals – far outweighed the danger.  Her crew, a motley bunch of seasoned explorers and thrill-seeking scientists, held their breath as the ship lurched through hyperspace, their destination a tantalizing beacon in the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
