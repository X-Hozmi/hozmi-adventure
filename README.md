
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin, patched countless times, offered little protection from the biting wind.  This journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage fueled by both faith and desperation, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, starvation gnawed at the edges of her hope, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a precarious rest.  Yet, the unwavering gleam of the distant mountain peaks spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with swirling gas giants and glittering constellations, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, cosmic radiation, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps – the thrill of exploration, the unyielding pull of the unknown, remained the same.  Eva felt the same surge of exhilaration as Elara, a shared human spirit daring to push beyond the boundaries of the known.
