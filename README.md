
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just dried meats and meager coin; it holds a map, rumored to lead to a lost monastery said to possess untold healing powers.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unpredictable wilderness and the unknown dangers that lurk around every bend in the trail.  The promise of healing, however, fuels her relentless spirit, pushing her forward despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius charts a course through the Orion Arm, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to contain a planet brimming with a resource capable of solving the Galactic Federation's energy crisis.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of void storms are commonplace hazards. The vast distances and the unforgiving nature of interstellar travel demand unwavering courage, precision, and a healthy dose of luck, but the potential reward eclipses even the most daunting of obstacles.
