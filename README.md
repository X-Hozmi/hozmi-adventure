
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the whispers of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, with every aching muscle and each daunting mountain pass conquered, her spirit soared.  The vast unknown, both terrifying and exhilarating, beckoned her onward, fuelled by a faith as unwavering as the stars above.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Warp drives hummed, bridging unimaginable distances between vibrant, alien worlds teeming with life both wondrous and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable expanse of the galaxy, but the lure of discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories and encountering civilizations beyond human comprehension, outweighed any risk. The universe was her oyster, and exploration, her destiny.
