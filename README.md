
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glint of Eldoria’s rumored golden spires spurred her onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy holding the last known colony of the Xantari people.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, far removed from the simple dangers Elara faced. Yet, the universal human need for exploration and the hope for a better future fueled her journey, mirroring the spirit of adventure that pushed medieval travelers like Elara across unknown lands.
