
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but the King's urgent missive, a perilous journey to deliver to the besieged city of Avignon.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and threatening, tested her courage as much as the miles themselves, the promise of safety and reward a distant shimmer on the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace anomalies was a daily test of skill and nerve, a far cry from the medieval dangers of her ancestors.  But the vastness of space, the silence punctuated only by the ship's hum, held a similar allure and peril. The unknown beckoned, a galaxy of possibilities and potential catastrophes awaiting her brave crew.
