
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Reginald's saddle as he guides his destrier across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests,  while treacherous mountain passes test both man and beast.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – a raging river to ford, a hostile baron to appease, the constant threat of starvation and disease.  The path to redemption is a winding one, paved with hardship and the unwavering hope of success.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  Warp drives hum, alien landscapes flash past the viewport, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks and unforeseen cosmic anomalies keeps her crew on edge.  The vastness of space offers both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of exploration across the uncharted cosmos.
