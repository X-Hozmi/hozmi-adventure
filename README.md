
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddlebag was a reminder of the long journey ahead – a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger were her constant companions, but the whisper of hope, the promise of a cure for her ailing brother, spurred her onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby as he navigated the treacherous currents between galaxies, his destination a distant planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, the ever-present danger of pirate attacks, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were small prices to pay for the chance to revolutionize galactic exploration and bring untold wealth to his crew.
