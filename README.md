
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's caravan lumbered across the sun-baked plains.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a heartbeat against the vast, indifferent landscape.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on their arduous journey from the bustling port city of Genoa to the fabled silk markets of the East.  The whispered tales of mythical beasts and enchanted forests fueled the travelers’ courage, but the reality of blistered feet, meager rations, and the endless horizon tested their resilience to the limit.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, every sunset a precarious hope for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was fraught with its own dangers - rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  Advanced technology replaced the caravan's oxen and creaking wheels, but the spirit of adventure remained the same: a thirst for the unknown, a willingness to brave the perils of the void for the sake of discovery and the promise of something extraordinary beyond the next star.
