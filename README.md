The dust kicked up by their hooves painted the landscape a hazy ochre as they traversed the unforgiving plains, the distant, jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a constant reminder of the journey's perilous nature.  Whispers of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, fueled his quest, pushing him ever closer to the unknown despite the lurking bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.
