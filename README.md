
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  He’d traded his blacksmith’s apron for a worn sword and a pouch full of denarii, seeking fortune and glory on the King's Highway.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to see lands beyond his village, fueled his weary steps towards the fabled city of Constantinople.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking celestial displays, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive were far removed from the dangers Thomas faced. Yet, the risks were no less real.  Asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids demanded constant vigilance.  Eva, with her crew of hardened spacefarers, navigated the cosmic ocean, driven by the same human spirit of exploration that had propelled Thomas across medieval Europe.
