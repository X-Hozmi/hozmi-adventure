
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey, but the lure of Eldoria, and the chance to escape his impoverished village, fueled his perseverance. Each sunrise brought new challenges and landscapes – from dense, shadowy forests to sun-baked plains stretching to the horizon – a testament to the wildness and untamed beauty of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents was commonplace on her interstellar voyages.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, held a stark contrast to the familiar terrestrial landscapes of her past. The thrill of exploration, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the profound wonder of discovering new worlds made each journey a gamble worth taking, a testament to humanity’s boundless curiosity and thirst for the unknown.
