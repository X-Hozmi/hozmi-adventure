
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals a new vista – the jagged peaks of the Taurus Mountains, the shimmering expanse of the Cilician plains, the ever-present threat of bandit raids lurking in the shadows of ancient ruins.  Our journey to Constantinople is fraught with peril, from scorching heat and treacherous terrain to the ever-present fear of disease and conflict. Yet, the lure of the fabled city, a beacon of culture and commerce, fuels our weary steps forward.  The untold riches and exotic spices whisper promises of fortune, making even the most arduous leg of the journey worthwhile.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship capable of faster-than-light travel, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human civilization.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where unforeseen celestial phenomena and hostile alien lifeforms could await.  The breathtaking nebulae and the sight of distant suns painting the blackness of space are a constant reward, but the weight of our responsibility – the future of humanity – hangs heavy in the pressurized air of our vessel.
