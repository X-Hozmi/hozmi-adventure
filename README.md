
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the wind whistling through the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his weary body and resolute spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy storms, and maintaining the ship's fragile life support system were constant concerns.  But the possibility of discovering new life, charting unknown galaxies, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweighed the risks.  The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, yet held the promise of breathtaking discovery.
