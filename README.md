
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of pine and woodsmoke from distant villages.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of the Ancients.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey across the untamed lands, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both excitement and death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  Navigating the cosmic currents, dodging asteroid fields the size of small moons, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness than the medieval wilds; a silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling of her comms, a constant reminder of her distance from home.
