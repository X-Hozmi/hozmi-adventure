
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a poor substitute for the warmth she craved.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint, and the tattered map promising riches in the fabled city of Zerzura – a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the chilling awareness of how far she still had to go.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Zerzura's opulence, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer, but the loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion.  Eva dreamt of lush alien landscapes, of discoveries that would rewrite the history books, but the cold vacuum of space reminded her of the vastness of her task and the fragile nature of her ship.  The journey, though technologically advanced, remained an adventure as perilous as any medieval quest.
