
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the very air seemed to whisper tales of disease and famine. Yet, the glint of the Crusader's cross on his chest spurred him on, the promise of adventure and redemption a beacon in the gathering gloom. Each sunrise brought new challenges, new landscapes, and the ever-present risk of death, a price he was willing to pay for his faith and the glory of his King.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the 'Starseeker,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate habitable planets for a rapidly expanding human civilization.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic failure, alien encounters ranged from peaceful trade to violent conflict, and the vastness of space itself presented an ever-present threat.  But Eva, fuelled by the boundless curiosity of humankind and the thrill of discovery, pressed forward, her gaze fixed on distant suns and the promise of new worlds.  Each jump was a gamble, each new system a breathtaking adventure into the unknown.
