
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the rumors of the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled the adventure, a constant gamble against the unknown wilderness and the perilous journey ahead.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance, but the thrill of discovery outweighed every hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigation was a dance with wormholes and nebulae, a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to contain a source of limitless energy, a prize coveted by empires across the known cosmos.  While the danger of rogue asteroids and hostile alien races was a constant companion, the vastness of space and the promise of discovery ignited a spirit of fearless exploration, propelling them onward in pursuit of the unknown.
