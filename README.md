
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the King's decree – a mission to retrieve a sacred relic from a remote monastery, rumored to be haunted by more than just mountain winds.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her fear and her fierce determination.  This journey, fraught with peril, held the promise of glory… or a grim end amidst the wild peaks.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a fleeing humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre, alien life forms was commonplace.  The vastness of space instilled both a profound loneliness and a thrilling sense of discovery. The ultimate prize, a new home for her people, lay somewhere amongst the glittering dust of a million suns.
