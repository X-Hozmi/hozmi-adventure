
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees. Her mule, laden with meager supplies and a half-finished tapestry, struggles uphill.  Each creak of its saddle is a reminder of the long journey ahead – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a perilous trek fraught with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every sunrise painting the mountains gold, her resolve strengthens, fueled by the whispers of miracles and the yearning for a journey's end that promises both solace and spiritual renewal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Vast distances separate her from her home planet, Aethel, and the alien civilization she's been dispatched to contact.  The hyperdrive hums a steady rhythm, a counterpoint to the crackling static from distant galaxies.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and hostile alien life – the thrill of exploration remains the same.  The unknown stretches before her, a vast canvas promising adventure and the discovery of worlds beyond imagining.
