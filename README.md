
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had already claimed two horses and tested their endurance to the breaking point.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation punctuated their days. Yet, the glint of unwavering faith in their eyes, fueled by whispered prayers and shared stories of miraculous healings, propelled them towards their holy goal, each sunrise a new chapter in their arduous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The crew faced dangers far beyond the medieval knight's: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failure.  But the lure of the unknown, the promise of scientific discovery, and the thrill of pushing human exploration to its limits outweighed the risks, forging a bond of camaraderie as strong as any medieval fellowship.
