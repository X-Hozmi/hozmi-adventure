The journey across the continent was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled dangerously with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from negotiating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

Yet, the potential discovery of a new habitable planet, a world teeming with life unlike anything encountered before, fueled her determination.  The galaxy held untold wonders, and she, along with her brave crew, were ready to face any cosmic storm to claim them.
