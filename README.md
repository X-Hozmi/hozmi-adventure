The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, snaked ahead, promising both peril and untold riches.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in his youthful imagination.

The dangers were different now – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms – but the thrill of discovery, the intoxicating allure of the unknown, remained a constant companion on her interstellar journey.
