
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey across the breadth of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled his relentless pursuit, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at her crew, but the hope of discovering new life, and charting unknown galaxies, spurred them onward, making their arduous journey a testament to human courage and the boundless thirst for exploration.
