
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Spanish plains stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contained more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to find work in a distant, rumored-to-be-prosperous city.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or the simple, relentless exhaustion of the road.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the distant horizon, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s crimson veil.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous political landscape of the intergalactic trade routes presented their own unique challenges, demanding quick thinking, precise piloting, and a healthy dose of courage.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life, but the promise of discovery and the hope of finding a new home fueled their ambitious voyage.
