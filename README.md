
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep with each labored step.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a relic capable of ending the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of legend and the hope of salvation fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  The journey was perilous, fraught with asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant gnawing fear of system failure in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance for humanity’s survival, propelled her forward, a lone adventurer in a cosmos teeming with both wonder and danger.
