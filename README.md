
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings swollen by relentless rain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the allure of the fabled spice markets of the East fuels our weary steps, promising fortunes and untold wonders beyond the horizon.  Every sunset reveals a star-dusted sky, a breathtaking testament to the vastness of the journey, mirroring the boundless ambition in our hearts.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of folding space, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to immortality.  The journey is fraught with peril: rogue asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies that threaten to tear our ship apart, and the ever-present threat of pirates who stalk the void. But the promise of eternal life, and the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and uncharted star systems, make the risks worthwhile.  The cosmos stretches before us, a breathtaking canvas of wonder and danger.
