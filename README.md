
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with salted meat and meager coin, pressed onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was as much a test of endurance as of faith. Each creaking step across the treacherous terrain brought him closer to his goal, but also closer to the dangers lurking in shadowed forests and the unpredictable hospitality of unfamiliar villages.  Bandits, disease, and the sheer brutality of the landscape were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace were commonplace.  Unlike Thomas, Elara’s journey wasn't fueled by faith, but by the insatiable human thirst for discovery, venturing where no starship had dared to go before.
