
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddle as I guide my destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each snort from my trusty steed, punctuates the vast silence broken only by the distant cry of a hawk.  My quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravages my homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are but small obstacles in the face of such a desperate need.  The road ahead is long and perilous, yet the hope of salvation fuels my onward journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out the silence of interstellar space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  We are pioneers, charting a course through unmapped nebulae and dodging asteroid fields that glitter like cosmic diamonds.  The crew, a diverse team of scientists and explorers, faces the unknown with courage, their collective expertise our only shield against the unforgiving vastness of space.  The future of humanity may depend on the success of this perilous expedition.
