
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cart groaning under the weight of salted meats and meager supplies.  Each creak of the wheel was a heartbeat against the backdrop of whispered rumors and uncertain paths ahead.  We crossed the Channel, a churning expanse of grey, then traversed the sun-baked plains of France, dodging bandits and sleeping under a sky thick with stars.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes, treacherous mountain passes, and bustling medieval towns that offered both respite and the risk of disease or intrigue. Our quest for the lost city of Eldoria demanded courage, resilience, and a faith in the stories etched on crumbling maps.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive is a constant companion as we traverse the Andromeda galaxy.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is routine, though the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and distant star clusters never cease to amaze.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known systems, share a common purpose fueled by ambition and the insatiable human need to discover.  The universe is vast and unforgiving, but the thrill of exploration, the promise of new worlds, propels us onward.
