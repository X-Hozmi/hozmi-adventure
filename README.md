
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the muddy track barely visible beneath the relentless downpour.  Each step was a battle against the elements and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  The destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a beacon in a sea of uncertainty.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the sting of hunger, the exhaustion of relentless travel, and the constant vigilance required to survive.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae, dodging asteroid fields the size of small planets, and bypassing hostile pirate fleets, the mission was perilous even by intergalactic standards.  Their prize?  The legendary Xylos crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a gamble with unimaginable rewards and catastrophic consequences.
