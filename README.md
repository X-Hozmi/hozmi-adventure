
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her trusty mare, Bess, picks her way across the parched landscape.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Saint Jude, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, the scorching sun beats down mercilessly, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's determination burns brighter, fueled by the hope of a cure for her ailing brother and the thrill of the unknown that lies ahead, beyond every sun-drenched hill and treacherous river crossing.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, Ryla and her crew face challenges that dwarf even the most daring medieval quests.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, is a lonely and unforgiving mistress, demanding courage, ingenuity, and a healthy dose of luck to survive the perils of interstellar exploration.
