
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the treacherous Black Forest, a place where magic and forgotten lore were said to thrive.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril –  as he traversed a world both beautiful and brutal, relying on his wits and his loyal blade to see him through.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and search for habitable planets, a journey spanning light-years and fueled by human curiosity and the insatiable desire to discover what lies beyond the known universe.  Each jump through hyperspace, each encounter with alien life, brought fresh challenges and wonder, reminding her of the boundless possibilities and terrifying unknowns that lay at the edge of infinity.
