
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys,  storms threatened to sweep her from the precarious mountain paths, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her belly.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, hidden in the icy peaks, fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each creak of the saddle, each gasp for breath, was a step closer to her destiny.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void, its hyperdrive a roaring symphony of controlled chaos.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  But the journey was far from peaceful.  Rogue asteroids threatened to shatter their hull,  unknown spatial anomalies warped reality around them, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders shadowed their path across the galaxy.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its breath as Ryla navigated her crew towards a future uncertain, yet brimming with the possibility of a new beginning.
