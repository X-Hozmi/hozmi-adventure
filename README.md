
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery at the edge of the known world, rumored to hold the secret to curing the Black Death that ravaged her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a stubborn ember against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Rex "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course plotted across light-years to the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship as they navigated asteroid fields and dodged the watchful eyes of the Kryll, a sentient species known for their hostility towards outsiders.  The bounty promised for the delivery of Xylossian crystals to the Galactic Consortium was a tempting reward, but the true thrill was the uncharted territory, the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and unexplored planets, pushing the boundaries of human space far beyond anything previously imagined.
