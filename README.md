
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each arduous mile, Elara's resolve hardened, spurred by the whispered legends of Zaragoza's untold riches and the chance to finally escape the stifling constraints of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson glare of the binary suns painting the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter* in an eerie glow.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of rediscovering lost human civilization, and perhaps uncovering the secrets of the wormhole itself, propelled Jax and her crew across the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
