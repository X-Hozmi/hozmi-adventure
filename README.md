
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – a sudden fever that could fell a man faster than a sword.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Samarkand and deliver a vital message, was a gamble against the elements, the warring factions that controlled the land, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  The journey was arduous, testing her resilience and pushing her to the limits of her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula NGC 7000, the North American Nebula, its celestial dust a breathtaking backdrop to her perilous voyage.  Navigating asteroid fields and negotiating the treacherous gravity wells of unexplored planets was commonplace. Her mission – a search for a lost colony on the fringes of known space – required not only impeccable piloting skills but also the courage to confront the unseen dangers that lurked within the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.  The galaxy was a vast and unforgiving frontier, but the thrill of discovery outweighed every risk.
