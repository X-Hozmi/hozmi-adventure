
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her weathered face.  Her journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches, fueled her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a testament to the unwavering spirit of adventure that drove her across the vast, unknown expanse.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, but the thrill of exploring uncharted galaxies never faded.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy, a prize worth the risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms and navigating wormholes that could tear his ship apart. The vastness of space, a tapestry of swirling colours and silent wonders, held far greater dangers than any medieval bandit, but the potential rewards mirrored the audacious spirit of the age of exploration, just in a different, breathtakingly vast arena.
