
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's chapped lips as she navigates the treacherous, winding path through the Black Forest.  Each creak of her saddle warns of potential bandits or worse – wild beasts lurking in the shadows. Her journey from Prague to Constantinople is fraught with peril, a tapestry woven with encounters of both kindness and cruelty.  She carries a vital message, a secret that could alter the course of a war, and the weight of her responsibility fuels her weary steps. The hope of reaching her destination alive, and making a difference, propels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across disparate planets following a catastrophic wormhole incident.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers is routine; the real challenge lies in deciphering the cryptic distress signals, each a faint whisper across the vast gulf of space.  The fate of thousands hangs in the balance, and Rexx, hardened by years of interstellar travel, knows that only courage and cunning will guide him to success.
