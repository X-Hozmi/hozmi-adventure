
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had already claimed several of their companions to disease and banditry.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of wolves howling in the distance.  Their meager supplies dwindled, but the hope of finding solace at the shrine, and the glory of their eventual return to the King, spurred them relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was fraught with peril; navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and maintaining the integrity of their hyperdrive were daily battles.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, remained focused, her gaze fixed on the distant glow of Kepler-186f, a beacon promising both scientific discovery and the lucrative reward that would finally allow her to settle down on a quiet, green world.
