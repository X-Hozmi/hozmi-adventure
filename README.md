
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains crimson.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland. Each creak of his worn saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse, the whispers of the supernatural that haunted these forgotten lands. His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering hope of a desperate man.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, its engines a low hum against the breathtaking spectacle of swirling cosmic dust. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across a thousand light-years to a galaxy unknown.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying, Ryla and her crew faced challenges far beyond the scope of any medieval knight. The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and unimaginable danger, tested their courage and their resolve at every turn.
