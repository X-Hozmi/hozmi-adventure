
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumours of spices and silks that fuelled his journey east.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his mount, marked another step toward the unknown, a tapestry woven with the threads of bandit encounters, treacherous mountain passes, and the tantalizing hope of unimaginable riches in the faraway Khan's court.  He carried little, but his spirit, fuelled by ambition and a thirst for adventure, was a boundless ocean.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of incandescent gas, the swirling colours a hypnotic dance against the backdrop of a million distant suns.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, a multi-generational odyssey spanning decades, was fraught with the perils of warp-core instability, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions preying on interstellar trade routes.  Yet, for Eva, the vastness of space was not a void, but a canvas upon which her dreams of discovery and expansion painted a future beyond human comprehension.
