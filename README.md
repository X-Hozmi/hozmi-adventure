
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery high in the Pyrenees, keepers of an ancient healing balm for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.  Yet, with every sunrise, the lure of the monastery, and the hope it held, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, CORA, calmly reporting gravitational shifts and charting a course through asteroid fields. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both promise and peril.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the chance to shape a new world, to leave her mark on the galaxy, fueled her unwavering determination.
