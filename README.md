
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travellers, inched its way across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the anxiety in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a heartbeat, each rise in the land a fresh challenge.  We were bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones, a place of untold riches and dangers, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our survival depended on our wits, our courage, and the unpredictable kindness of strangers.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant galaxies. We’re on a mission to Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harbouring life, a journey measured not in days, but in years of hyperspace travel.  The vast emptiness holds both wonder and terror; the silent hum of the engines is a constant companion, punctuated only by the occasional alert of approaching asteroids or the thrilling discovery of a previously uncharted system.  The ultimate prize –  contact with alien life –  justifies the immeasurable risks.
