
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Castilla a fiery orange.  Her journey to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the unforgiving terrain tested both beast and rider.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording rushing rivers, and bartering for meagre sustenance in isolated villages.  Yet, the allure of the sacred city, the whispers of miracles and the thrill of the unknown, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and countless uncharted systems.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to uncover the colony's fate, and the sheer audacity of interstellar travel propelled her forward, a lone star amongst a billion suns.
