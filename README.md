
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, offered little comfort against the biting wind and the gnawing fear of bandits.  Each creaking wagon wheel was a testament to the arduous journey ahead, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding the cure for her ailing brother.  The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple, a dramatic backdrop to the silent struggle against the elements and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints, but the reward – a newly discovered planet rumored to contain a rare mineral capable of powering faster-than-light travel – was worth the risk.  Across the vast gulf of interstellar space, they sought not just riches, but a future powered by possibilities beyond their wildest dreams, a future where the boundaries of the cosmos were merely a starting point.
