
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood – a grim reminder of the bandit raid they’d narrowly escaped days ago. His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King in the far-off capital, felt less like a noble duty and more a desperate race against the encroaching winter and the ever-present threat of violence.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-watchful eyes of those who would see him fail.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a breathtaking spectacle to most, were merely navigation markers to her.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony ship, 'Hope's End', and return its inhabitants to the galactic alliance.  The journey was perilous, demanding both her skill as a pilot and her fortitude in the face of uncharted space, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Yet, the vastness of the cosmos, the promise of new discoveries, and the hope of rescuing those lost, fuelled her onward.
