
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, was far from over.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present fear of disease.  Yet, the glint of the distant sun on their armor, the camaraderie amongst his men, and the unwavering faith in their quest spurred them onward, their adventure a tapestry woven with hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear the ship apart, while unknown alien entities lurked in the inky blackness between stars.  Elara's courage, and the advanced technology at her disposal, were her only shields against the vast and unforgiving expanse of space, a thrilling, perilous adventure among the stars.
