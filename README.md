
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise painting the sky in hues of hope, Thomas pressed on, driven by faith and the unwavering desire to reach his sacred destination, encountering diverse cultures and overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles along the way.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding the utmost skill and courage.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing the ship's battered hull under the constant threat of radiation, Eva and her crew faced challenges far beyond the wildest imaginings of medieval travelers.  Their destination, a beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space, promised a future worth fighting for.
