
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, blurring the horizon as he and his small band pressed on, their objective a rumored lost city whispered of in taverns and sung by wandering bards.  Each creak of saddle leather, each whinny of their exhausted mounts, was a testament to the grueling journey – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road their constant companions. The lure of untold riches and the glory of discovery, however, kept their spirits – and their weary limbs – moving.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova, her weathered face etched with the harsh beauty of deep space, guided her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of interstellar navigation were as real as any medieval bandit:  rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on unsuspecting travelers. Yet, the promise of new worlds, uncharted territories teeming with alien life and untold resources, fueled her unwavering determination. The cosmos was vast, but Rostova, like Reginald before her, was driven by an insatiable thirst for adventure.
