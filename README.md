
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun beating down, and nights spent huddled around meager fires, listening to the howling wolves.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown, but the allure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the desert of his ambition, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Facing treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her unwavering determination. The cosmos, a breathtaking yet unforgiving expanse, tested their limits, but the promise of discovery spurred them onward, a journey as perilous and captivating as any medieval pilgrimage.
