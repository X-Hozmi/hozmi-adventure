
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, bandit-infested forests, and across sun-baked plains where the only company was the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to outwitting cunning highwaymen, but the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of his ambition, kept him pressing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the constant pressure of dwindling oxygen reserves were daily occurrences.  But the promise of discovering a new home for humanity, and unraveling the mysteries of a forgotten civilization, spurred her onward through the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
