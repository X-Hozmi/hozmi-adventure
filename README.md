
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales of spices and silks whispered in the taverns of Rouen.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the travelers along the dusty roads, and the ever-present threat of famine loomed large. Yet, the promise of untold riches and adventure fueled his weary steps, pushing him ever closer to the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport painted a breathtaking panorama, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and potentially encountering civilizations both friendly and hostile. The vastness of space, while beautiful, held dangers both known and unimaginable.  But the lure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries, was a siren's song she couldn't resist.
