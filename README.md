
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than hope.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, a quest for a cure rumored to reside only in its hidden apothecaries.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals to the far-flung colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and potentially encountering pirate fleets and hostile alien lifeforms.  While the comfort of his starship was a far cry from Elara's mule, the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel held an equally thrilling, and far more technologically complex, challenge.
