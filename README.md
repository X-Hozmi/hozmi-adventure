
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a jostling mass of pack animals and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mimicking the swirling anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing threat of bandits, the unpredictable whims of the weather, and the ever-present fear of the unknown that stretches beyond the next ridge.  Our quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets – a journey fraught with peril, but one promising untold rewards for those brave enough to endure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cuts through the inky blackness, its engines a low hum against the cosmic symphony.  We are bound for Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, promising fertile lands and untold possibilities for humanity.  But the vast emptiness holds its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of the uncharted nebulae.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to forge a new beginning amongst the stars, fuels our courage and propels us forward into the great unknown.
