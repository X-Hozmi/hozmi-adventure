
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague.  The journey was arduous, a relentless test of endurance and courage against the unforgiving landscape, yet the promise of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent algae from the planet Kepler-186f, a vital component in a revolutionary terraforming project.  The jump to hyperspace was a breathtaking gamble, a dance with cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Elara's journey across familiar lands, Eva's was a voyage into the unknown, charting unmapped star systems and facing dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers. The cosmos held immense rewards, but at an equally immense cost.
