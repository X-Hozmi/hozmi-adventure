
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold untold riches and even magic.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the Black Forest, and the endless, unforgiving landscape tested his resilience daily.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – starvation, disease, or the wrath of a rival lord – but the lure of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel, kept him pushing ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Asteroids, rogue gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships made every jump a gamble. But the potential scientific breakthrough, the hope of curing a devastating galactic plague, fueled her determination. The vastness of space, while terrifying, held an allure far greater than any earthly kingdom.
