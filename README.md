
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône valley.  Her quest: to reach Avignon, bearing a vital message for the Pope, a secret whispered only to her by a dying knight.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges—crossing treacherous mountain passes, navigating swollen rivers, and constantly dodging the suspicious glances of those who saw a lone woman travelling so far, so alone.  Her only companions were her wits, her worn map, and the unwavering hope that her journey would save lives.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Petrova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the aggressive patrol ships of the Kryll Hegemony were just the start.  Alien encounters, both hostile and strangely beautiful, punctuated her journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy.  The weight of her crew's lives, the fate of humanity's expansion, and the promise of a new era rested on her shoulders and the reliability of her aging starship.
