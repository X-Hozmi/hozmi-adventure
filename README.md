
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a perilous route through the Black Forest to Prague.  Rumours of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient texts and untold riches, fuelled his journey, a dangerous gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or an untimely end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and hidden dangers, was both exhilarating and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all part of the intrepid journey, a quest for new knowledge and the expansion of humanity's reach across the galaxy.
