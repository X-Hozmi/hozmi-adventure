
Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the Breton countryside was arduous – muddy tracks swallowed his horse's legs, bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon. Yet, the lure of Camelot, and the whispered promise of King Arthur's favor, fueled his relentless advance.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the malice of men.

Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, the hyperdrive whining as it propelled her ship across the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way.

The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet rumored to hold ancient secrets.  The risks were astronomical – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating beyond the reach of galactic law.  But for Eva, the thrill of discovery far outweighed the peril.
