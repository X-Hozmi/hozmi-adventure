
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hurried scribbles, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the price of her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria. The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of Eldoria’s rumored healing springs spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Kepler-186f was risky, pushing the *Stardust's* hyperdrive to its limits.  Ahead lay the promise of a new colony, a chance to escape the overpopulated systems of the Old Republic, but also the uncertainties of an uncharted world and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone vessels.  The vast, inky expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amongst the stars.
