
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust devils in the fading light.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their determination hardening with each arduous mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids in the uncharted reaches of space were commonplace hazards.  But the true challenge lay in the vast distances and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  The weight of countless lives, the future of a fledgling colony, rested on her capable shoulders, a responsibility far heavier than any earthly burden.
