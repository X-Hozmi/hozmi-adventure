
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the secret to curing the Black Death that ravaged her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the chilling breath of the plague itself.  Survival, not comfort, was the only luxury she afforded herself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking a rumored source of Xylos, a rare element vital to sustaining life on her dying homeworld.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a different kind of perilous journey.  Alien encounters, equipment malfunctions, and the crushing weight of loneliness posed threats as real as any medieval bandit.  The survival of her crew, and her planet, depended on her reaching her destination.
