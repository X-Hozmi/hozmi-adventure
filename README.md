
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse, a necessary evil to reach the Sultan's lost city rumored to hold unimaginable riches.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a thrill of both fear and excitement through him; the journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward – and the glory of a successful quest – fueled his weary bones.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hyperdrive hummed a steady, reassuring song against the vast, silent emptiness of space, punctuated only by the crackle of the comms system and the occasional alert from the navigation console.  The journey was long and arduous, a test of both technology and human endurance, but the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, spurred her on, a modern-day explorer charting the uncharted cosmos.
