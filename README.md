
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life in the fabled lands beyond.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of potential peril – bandits, starvation, the unpredictable wrath of nature. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant cities and whispered legends, spurred her onward, a tiny speck against the vast, breathtaking landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next giant leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the ever-present threat of pirate vessels wasn't just a job; it was a dance with fate across the infinite canvas of space.  The vastness of the cosmos both terrified and exhilarated him, a constant reminder of the boundless possibilities and equally boundless dangers that lay beyond the reach of any known star.
