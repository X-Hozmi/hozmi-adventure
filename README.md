
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Her journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow her whole, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any human. Yet, with each step, her determination burned brighter than the fading light, fueled by the unwavering hope of reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star cruiser a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of a thousand swirling colours.  Her mission: to reach the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia, to retrieve a vital energy source for a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel offered little respite from the isolation; the weight of responsibility and the endless expanse of space pressed down on her crew.  But the promise of salvation, of a future for humanity, propelled them onward, each warp jump a leap of faith into the unimaginable vastness of the cosmos.
