
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand. Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, suspicious villagers, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Yet, the allure of Ys, and the desperate hope for her brother's survival, fuels her onward, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones that line her path.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter.'  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, holds both wonder and peril.  Warp drives malfunction, alien encounters are unpredictable, and the constant threat of pirate attacks keeps the crew on edge.  But the promise of finding Kepler-186f, and the hope for a united galaxy, keeps Rexx and his crew pressing forward, defying the seemingly endless void.
