
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – he was weeks overdue, chasing rumors of a lost monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled his apprehension, but the promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge spurred him on, through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving rivers, towards an uncertain destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the unknown dangers of uncharted space held a different kind of thrill.  The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas of swirling colors and unimaginable celestial bodies, both awed and terrified her, as she pushed the limits of human exploration in pursuit of a new beginning for humanity among the stars.
