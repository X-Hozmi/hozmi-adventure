
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them as they traversed the unforgiving landscape, the ancient stones of a forgotten kingdom looming in the distance.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that tested their resolve. But the lure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to hold unimaginable power, fueled their perilous journey across the kingdom, a quest that promised glory…or death.

The jump to Xylos had been smoother than anticipated, but the alien landscape awaiting them held mysteries far more potent than any medieval bandit.  With her crew relying on her every decision, and the fate of a fragile alliance hanging in the balance, Eva navigated not only the treacherous cosmic currents but also the complex political climate of a galaxy teeming with untold wonders and ancient threats.
