
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her meager supplies – a waterskin almost empty, a half-eaten loaf of bread, and a worn map promising riches in the distant city of Avignon – were all that stood between her and the unforgiving wilderness.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunset a testament to her resilience and a reminder of the unknown that lay ahead.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of a life beyond the confines of her village, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its hyperdrive spitting trails of ionized gas. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a routine one for a seasoned explorer like Ryla, yet the thrill of discovering new worlds, charting unmapped galaxies, and facing the unpredictable nature of space – from rogue asteroids to hostile alien life – never faded.  The vast emptiness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held an allure as potent as any medieval quest.
