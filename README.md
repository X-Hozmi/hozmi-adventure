
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the tales of bustling markets and fertile lands whispered in taverns months ago.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Michael, a journey fraught with peril through bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing uncertainty of survival in a world where the only map was the unreliable memory of a grizzled mercenary.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of her hyperdrive painting streaks across the star-strewn canvas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from her home in the Sol system.  The journey, though measured in light-years, was fraught with its own brand of danger – solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on vulnerable transports. Yet, unlike Sir Reginald, Eva possessed technology that shrunk the vastness of space, allowing her to dream of new beginnings among the stars while battling the harsh realities of interstellar travel.
