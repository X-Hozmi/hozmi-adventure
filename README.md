
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack laden with meager supplies and a heart full of hope.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, pull her onward despite the dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, wild beasts prowling the unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, as she pushes ever closer to her elusive prize.  The journey itself is the adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, vibrant colours swirling around her vessel like cosmic paint.  Their mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a galaxy potentially teeming with life.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the attention of hostile alien factions, and wrestling with the unpredictable nature of spacetime are all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, but the thrill of discovery and the promise of uncharted territories fuels their relentless pursuit across the light years.
