
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, each day a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unforgiving elements.  The promise of Samarkand's silks and spices, whispered in hushed tones around crackling campfires, fuels our weary steps, a potent elixir against the ever-present threat of starvation and death.  The journey is brutal, yet the thrill of the unknown, the shared hardship, and the sheer audacity of traversing such vast distances binds us together in a tenuous brotherhood.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship groaning under the weight of its interstellar journey, carries us towards Kepler-186f, a world promising life beyond our dying sun.  We are not pilgrims, but pioneers, navigating through asteroid fields and wormholes, our course charted by algorithms and the faintest whispers of radio waves from a long-dead civilization.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant galaxies, is both terrifying and awe-inspiring, a testament to human ambition and our insatiable curiosity to explore the infinite unknown.
