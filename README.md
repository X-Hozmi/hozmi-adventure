
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family,  a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands of the east, escaping the devastating famine that gripped their village.  Every creak of the saddle, every distant wolf howl, every unfamiliar town encountered was a step into the unknown, a gamble against starvation and banditry.  The road was fraught with peril, but the promise of survival fueled her relentless stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel, Eva felt a kinship with those medieval travelers, facing their own vast, dangerous landscapes. The challenges were different – cosmic radiation instead of bandits, hyperspace jumps instead of horse-drawn carts – but the spirit of adventure, the unwavering drive to reach a better tomorrow, remained the same, a timeless human trait.
