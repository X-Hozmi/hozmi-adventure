
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses weary and flanks sweating.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen by spring melt, and into the shadowy embrace of ancient, whispering forests teeming with bandits and wilder things.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril, yet also the unwavering hope of reaching their sacred destination, a hope fueled by whispered legends and the unwavering faith in their hearts.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the spectacle.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the sheer scale of the cosmos still held a humbling awe.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work for a seasoned starship captain, but the loneliness of interstellar space and the weight of her crew's fate pressed upon her with each passing lightyear.
