
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape to the Sultan's court was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, the lure of the Sultan's rumored hoard of ancient artifacts, and the chance to prove his valor, spurred him onward, each sunrise a fresh test of endurance and courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space held wonders beyond comprehension, but also threats far greater than any medieval knight could ever imagine.
