
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and shadowed forests concealing bandits, rival knights, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the unknown dangers and thrilling possibilities that lay ahead on her perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the nebula swirling outside her viewport a breathtaking canvas of cosmic colours.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raiders.  Navigation was a delicate dance between advanced technology and intuition, each jump a gamble with the vast, unknowable expanse of space, promising discovery and peril in equal measure.
