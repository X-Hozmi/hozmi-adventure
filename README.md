
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, the unwavering pursuit of a legendary salvation driving them across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant canvas of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her mission: to establish a vital hyperspace relay on the far side of the galaxy, a crucial link in the intergalactic trade network.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of subspace currents, Eva faced perils as vast and unyielding as any medieval knight. Yet, the vastness of space offered a different kind of thrill, the potential for discovery a powerful counterpoint to the constant dangers.
