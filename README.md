
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a chipped map, a few meager coins, and the hope of finding her brother, lost amidst the chaos of the Hundred Years' War. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger, but also the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of war were but small prices to pay for the chance of reunion.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across galaxies by a catastrophic wormhole event.  The journey was perilous, fraught with the dangers of uncharted space – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure. Yet, the vastness of space held an irresistible allure, a promise of discovery that outweighed any risk.  The search for Xylos was a quest for survival, but also for the knowledge that lay hidden amongst the stars.
