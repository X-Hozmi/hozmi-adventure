
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara nestled deep within the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the saint's healing powers, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, each day bringing new challenges and breathtaking vistas across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers in derelict freighters, and coping with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace jumps, were all part of a typical day's work.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the immense distances and equally immense risks inherent in interstellar travel.
