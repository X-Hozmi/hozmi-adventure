
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary mount onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track winding through the French countryside, a far cry from the promised riches of the Orient.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown hedgerows, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the Black Death, whose chilling shadow already stretched across the land.  His quest, a desperate scramble for fortune and glory, tested his endurance as much as his courage.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *The Icarus*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving expanse of space separating her from her destination, Kepler-186f.  The potential rewards – invaluable data and the promise of a new human colony – were immense, but so were the dangers.  Asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself threatened to cut short her journey and scatter the crew of *The Icarus* like dust across the cosmos.
