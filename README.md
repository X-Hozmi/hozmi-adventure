
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her worn map, patched with prayer-scribbled parchment, promised a hidden monastery nestled deep within the Black Forest, a sanctuary whispered to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter all loomed large on her journey.  The whispered promise of the monastery fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigation was a dance with cosmic currents and treacherous nebulae, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion to the breathtaking panoramas of swirling gas clouds and distant, uncharted star systems.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of legend among the starfaring clans.  The vastness of space held both incredible beauty and terrifying unknowns; a single malfunction could mean oblivion, yet the lure of discovery burned brighter than any star.
