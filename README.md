
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's pardon, a sealed scroll clutched tightly to his chest, a lifeline in this treacherous landscape.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the Black Forest, and the whispers of plague rode on the wind. Each creak of the mule's harness, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine.  His journey to the distant Holy City was fraught with peril, a test of faith, endurance, and the sheer will to survive.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, its iridescent colours a breathtaking spectacle, but also a potential hazard.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system and retrieve a sample of the rare element, Xylium.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels from the Orion Arm was commonplace.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely and dangerous realm.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where the rewards were immense, but failure meant oblivion.
