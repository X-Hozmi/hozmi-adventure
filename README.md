
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rutted track barely visible beneath the mud.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each labored breath of the pack animals, marked the slow, agonizing progress across the unforgiving landscape.  We'd traded the relative safety of the village for the whispered promise of El Dorado, a mythical city rumored to hold unimaginable riches.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were far more real than any gold, yet the lure of adventure, the yearning for something more than the monotonous cycle of farm work, pushed us onward.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our roadmap.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  This wasn't a quest for gold, but for knowledge—a firsthand exploration of the Xylos nebula, a region brimming with unexplored planets and potentially, alien life.  The risks were different now; cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unknown dangers lurking on uncharted worlds were far more terrifying than any medieval bandit. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the unyielding human desire to push boundaries, propelled us forward into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
