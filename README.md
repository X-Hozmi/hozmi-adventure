
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with the King's commission.  The journey to Avignon, fraught with bandits and treacherous mountain passes, is a test of endurance.  Each sunset brings a new peril – a whispered warning of a plague-ridden village, the ominous silhouette of a castle on a distant crag, or the rustling of unseen creatures in the thickets.  Her only companions are the unwavering sun and the ghosts of countless travelers who have trod this unforgiving path before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the swirling cosmic dust.  The journey, measured not in days but in light years, is a solitary one punctuated by the rhythmic hum of the warp drive and the occasional crackle of long-range communication.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, dwarfs even the most seasoned explorer's ambitions, but the promise of discovery fuels her onward, towards the furthest reaches of the known universe.
