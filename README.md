
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and fear clinging to the air.  Her worn map, more faded prayer than guide, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit or beast, but the hope of healing spurred her onward, a determined silhouette against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was perilous, a test of endurance and will against the backdrop of a medieval world brimming with both beauty and brutality.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of a dying star painting the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane oceans of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from the bustling spaceport of New Eden.   Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate raiders, the vastness of the cosmos both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The galaxy was his battlefield, and the reward – the survival of a colony – far outweighed the dangers of this interstellar voyage.
