
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he spurred his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the parched grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or a chance encounter with the strange and wonderful creatures whispered about in taverns. The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled his every stride.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the eerie beauty of alien planets and the ever-present threat of pirate raids, tested her crew's courage.  Unlike Sir Gareth, Elara's challenges were technological and interstellar, yet the human drive for discovery and the courage to face the unknown remained a constant across the ages.
