
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of every crag, and the unforgiving terrain tested her strength and resilience at every turn. Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of the unknown, spurred her onward, a single unwavering star guiding her through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm centuries ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars, Rexx relied on his crew's expertise and the ship's aging hyperdrive.  The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and deadly danger, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel and the monumental risks he took for the chance of finding Aethelred.
