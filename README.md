
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving elements.  The whispered legends of Zerzura, however, fueled his determination, each step a testament to his unwavering hope.


Centuries later, Elara steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling cosmic storms were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacefarer.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a stark beauty, and the lure of discovery eclipsed the ever-present dangers, driving her towards the unknown frontiers of the galaxy.
