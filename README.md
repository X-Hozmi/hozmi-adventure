
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the legendary Abbey of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the odds.  Yet, the glint of the distant spire fueled his determination, a beacon of hope amidst the despair.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a fledgling colony teetering on the brink of collapse.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos dwarfed her ship, but the weight of responsibility, and the faint hope of a thriving new world, kept her course unwavering.
