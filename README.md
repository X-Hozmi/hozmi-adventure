
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her dark braid across her face.  Her mule, laden with meager supplies and a worn map, struggled against the incline.  The scent of pine and snow battled with the ever-present tang of fear – fear of bandits, of starvation, of the unknown lands that lay beyond the towering peaks. This journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a quest for a legendary healing herb, was fraught with peril, but the possibility of saving her ailing brother fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of breathtaking colours, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  While the dangers were different – asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates – the thrill of discovery remained.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and swirling galaxies, held a similar allure to the untamed wilderness of medieval times; both called to the intrepid spirit, promising adventure and the unknown.
