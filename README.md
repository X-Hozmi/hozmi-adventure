
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope for her brother fuelled her onward, pushing her through exhaustion and despair towards the unknown horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the nebula's swirling colours, the crimson gas a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of his starship.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Xylos system, a perilous journey across light years of unpredictable space.  Facing asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the constant threat of engine failure, Jaxx relied on his crew's skill and unwavering courage to reach their destination, a gamble with interstellar distances and unknown dangers.
