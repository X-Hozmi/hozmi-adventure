
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fuelled his determination to push ever further into the uncharted heartland, a tapestry woven with both peril and breathtaking beauty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  Warp drives hummed, the ship a fragile vessel against the immensity of the cosmos.  Asteroids threatened, alien lifeforms lurked, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel tested her crew's resolve. But the promise of discovery, the potential to rewrite history, propelled them forward towards the unknown, a journey as much into the human spirit as into the endless dark.
