
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  The journey promised hardship, but the allure of the unknown, the chance to uncover a legend lost to time, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored planets tested the limits of her ship and her crew's courage.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, offered both the promise of discovery and the ever-present threat of the unknown, a danger as profound as any faced by medieval adventurers.
