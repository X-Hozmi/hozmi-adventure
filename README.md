
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the pass, their horses exhausted from the relentless climb.  Below, the valley stretched, a tapestry of emerald green and ochre brown, promising both respite and peril.  Their quest – to reach the legendary Sunstone monastery nestled deep within the Dragon's Tooth mountains –  was proving far more arduous than the King's pronouncements had suggested.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their mettle with each passing league.  The journey itself, a tapestry woven with sweat, blood, and the unwavering hope of reaching their goal, had already become an adventure of epic proportions.


Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by the warp-storm decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily occurrence, each hyperspace jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding survivors clinging to life on the edge of oblivion, spurred her crew onwards.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held the promise of untold wonders – or utter annihilation.
