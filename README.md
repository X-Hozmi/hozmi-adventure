
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary steed onward. The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of France, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests where bandits lurked.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of never reaching his destination, but the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape of intergalactic travel permits.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered no respite from the constant vigilance required to keep her crew and precious cargo safe.  The journey was a lonely dance among the stars, yet the hope of reaching Kepler-186f fueled her relentless pursuit.
