
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The rutted track, barely a trail through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless downpour.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Burgundy, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows, and whispers of a monstrous beast roaming the wilds kept his hand ever near the hilt of his sword.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, threatened to unravel his mission.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation bombarded the hull, while the unpredictable gravitational forces of nearby celestial bodies tested the ship's resilience.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, navigated the treacherous expanse with skill and unwavering determination, her eyes fixed on the promise of a new dawn on a distant, uncharted world.
