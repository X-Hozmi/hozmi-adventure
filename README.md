
The medieval era was a time of great adventure, as people travelled across the land by foot, horse, or boat.  Knights would journey to distant lands in search of glory, while merchants would traverse dangerous routes to trade goods.  These journeys were fraught with peril, as travellers faced bandits, wild animals, and the elements.  Yet, they were also filled with wonder, as adventurers encountered new cultures and landscapes.  The medieval era was a time when the world was still vast and unknown, and the possibilities for adventure were endless.

In the future era, travel between planets and galaxies is a commonplace occurrence.  Spacefaring vessels can traverse the vast distances of the cosmos, bringing people and cultures together.  But the journey itself is fraught with danger, as travellers must contend with the perils of space, such as radiation, meteoroids, and the vacuum of space.  Still, the allure of exploring the unknown and discovering new worlds is irresistible, drawing adventurers to the stars.  The future era is a time of great possibilities, and the boundaries of human exploration are constantly expanding.
