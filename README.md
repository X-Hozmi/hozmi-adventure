
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her as she seeks a legendary healer rumored to reside in the distant mountains.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey, testing her resilience and resourcefulness with each passing mile.  The whispers of adventure are real, laced with danger and the promise of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship cutting a path through asteroid fields and swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by sentient flora.  The vast distances between stars and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps are daunting, but Ryla and her crew press onward, driven by a sense of purpose and the thrill of exploring the uncharted corners of the galaxy.  The future holds boundless possibilities, and the stars await.
