
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising a route to the mythical city of Ys.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death are her constant companions on this perilous journey, each sunrise bringing a new challenge and a fresh test of her courage and resourcefulness.  The whispers of Ys, of unimaginable riches and untold magic, fuel her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of Kepler-186f a distant memory.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hums with the energy of a thousand dying suns as he charts a course for the Andromeda galaxy, a pilgrimage to a rumored planet teeming with a pre-sentient energy source.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the occasional gravitational anomaly and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, presents a different kind of challenge – one of technology and unwavering resolve.  The potential reward, however, is the same: the discovery of something truly extraordinary.
