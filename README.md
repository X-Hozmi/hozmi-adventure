
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a familiar comfort amidst the looming uncertainties of his journey.  He was bound for the distant city of Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered promises of healing and a desperate need to escape the shadow of the plague that stalked his village.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, suspicious-looking strangers, and the constant gnawing fear of bandits. Yet, the vast, unpredictable landscape also offered moments of breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the terror that haunted his steps.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highways.  Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the fringes of known space, a journey fraught with perilous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  While the technology allowed for faster-than-light travel, the vastness of space was a lonely place, demanding both skill and courage. The reward, however, the chance to uncover a lost piece of human history, fuelled her determination to press on, despite the immeasurable risks.
