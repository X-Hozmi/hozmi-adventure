
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the splintered kingdoms had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the whispered promise of the mythical Sunstone, said to heal the blighted lands, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new brush with fate, forging her into something stronger than she'd ever imagined.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, a nebula of vibrant colours swirling outside the viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Xylos galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The jump gates spat them out into alien systems, each a gamble; unknown flora, hostile fauna, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the vastness of space, the sheer wonder of discovering new worlds, fuelled her relentless drive, making the risks pale in comparison to the potential rewards.
