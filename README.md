
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – seeds for a new life in a rumored land beyond the mountains, a land promised with fertile soil and freedom from the plague that ravages her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the burning hope in her heart fuels her onward, a single candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, *The Wanderer*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport are breathtaking, a cosmic canvas painted with the brushstrokes of dying stars.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The vast distances are nothing compared to the risks – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning warp drives.  But Rexa, hardened by years of exploration, steers her ship towards the unknown, driven by the insatiable human thirst for discovery and the promise of a universe yet unexplored.
