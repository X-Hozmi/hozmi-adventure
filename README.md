The rough track, barely a path through the dense forest, offered little respite from the biting flies and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a thrill of anticipation – or fear – down his spine.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a promise of discovery – and potentially, destruction.
