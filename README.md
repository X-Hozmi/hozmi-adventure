
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones at taverns and campfires.  Bandits were a constant threat, the terrain unforgiving, and supplies dwindling – yet the lure of the unknown, the possibility of untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each crunch of gravel under her horse's hooves, was a step closer to destiny, or perhaps, disaster.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant hues of the cosmic dust swirled around them, a breathtaking but treacherous landscape.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of the galaxy, fraught with the potential for encountering hostile alien life or catastrophic navigational errors.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel was a siren song too powerful to resist.
