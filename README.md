
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each unfamiliar face encountered along the muddy track, held both the promise of succor and the threat of banditry, illness, and the ever-present shadow of death.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a gamble against time itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope in a galaxy scattered with forgotten worlds.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory tactics of the Kryll pirates, Eva relied on her wits, her crew's loyalty, and the cutting-edge technology of her starship.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely expanse, every jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.  The search for life, for connection, was a relentless pursuit across unimaginable distances.
