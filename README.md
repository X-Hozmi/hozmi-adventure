
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creaking cart wheel and barking dog in the distant villages marked both progress and peril, for bandits roamed these roads, and the whispers of plague stalked the land just as surely as the shadow of the approaching night.  He carried little but his sword, his faith, and the hope of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The swirling colours of cosmic dust painted a breathtaking backdrop to her perilous journey to Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity's desperate exodus from a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel was fraught with danger; unpredictable spatial anomalies threatened to tear her ship apart, and the vast emptiness of space held unknown terrors lurking in the darkness between stars.  Her mission wasn't just exploration; it was the survival of a species.
