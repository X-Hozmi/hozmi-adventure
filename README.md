
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The map, a crudely drawn parchment, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains, a legendary city of gold said to be guarded by fierce griffons.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat - bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  His journey was a gamble, a desperate hope against the grim reality of famine back home, a quest for fortune fueled by a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos.  The iridescent gases shimmered around her ship, a breathtaking but treacherous landscape of stellar winds and unpredictable gravity wells.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a planet teeming with resources crucial to the survival of her people.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and deadly hazards, held the promise of a new beginning – or a catastrophic end.  The journey was a test of skill, courage, and the limits of human ingenuity.
