
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elara from the treacherous Baron Alaric, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and rumors of monstrous beasts haunted the whispering grasslands.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each nightfall the chilling certainty that survival was a daily victory hard-won.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking distraction from the daunting task ahead.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and deciphering cryptic alien signals tested the crew's limits. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and the ever-present threat of oblivion.
