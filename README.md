
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a shimmering serpent of pack mules and weary men, snaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air hung thick with the scent of dust and sweat, punctuated by the occasional acrid tang of campfire smoke.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, the whispered tales of exotic spices and untold riches in Cathay, spurred us onward, each arduous mile a step closer to the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from starlight and dreams, cut through the inky black of the void.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light years away, promising a new Eden.  But the journey was far from peaceful.  Warp jumps brought fleeting glimpses of nebulae ablaze with cosmic fire, while the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue space pirates kept us on high alert. The thrill of exploration mingled with the gnawing fear of the vast, uncaring universe, a stark contrast to the earthly dangers of our ancestors.
