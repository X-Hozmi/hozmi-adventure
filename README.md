
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked plains stretching before her like a sea of ochre.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, had been fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested her courage and resilience. Yet, the allure of the lost oasis, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, kept her pushing forward, each sunrise a fresh chance to conquer the unforgiving landscape and draw closer to her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to locate and secure the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumoured to possess technology capable of bridging the vast expanse between galaxies.  With a crew of hardened spacefarers and a ship brimming with advanced technology, he faced perils far removed from Elara's—cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of uncharted space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential for groundbreaking advancement, pushed him onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
