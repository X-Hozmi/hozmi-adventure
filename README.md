
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely more than a rutted trail, snaked through the unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside.  He carried with him a King's decree, a promise of riches, and the gnawing fear of bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Each sunrise brought the tantalizing hope of reaching his destination, a legendary monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, yet also the grim reality of another day's relentless journey across a land both beautiful and brutally indifferent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the breathtaking, alien vistas unfolding outside her viewport. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a gamble against unimaginable distances and the unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.  The thrill of exploration, the vastness of space, and the weight of responsibility for the lives of her crew fueled her every decision, a very different kind of adventure, yet one that mirrored the bravery and uncertain hope of those medieval journeys.
