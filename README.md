
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a worn map – her only guides on a perilous journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, but the promise of finding her brother fueled her onward, a beacon in the fading light.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic map of the Andromeda galaxy shimmering before him.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, was battered but not broken, having just navigated a treacherous asteroid field. The mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization clinging to existence on the far side of the galaxy.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, but the thought of finding Xylos – and perhaps uncovering ancient secrets – spurred Rexx and his crew onward, their journey a gamble on the vast canvas of the cosmos.
