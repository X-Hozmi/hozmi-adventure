
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail was barely a track, winding through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent a thrill of apprehension through him – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the plague stalked him as relentlessly as the setting sun.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  The journey demanded resilience, cunning, and a heart steeled against despair.


Centuries hence, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The dangers were different – treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the spirit of adventure remained the same; a relentless push against the unknown, fueled by courage, ingenuity, and a desperate hope for survival in the vast, uncharted expanse of space.
