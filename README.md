
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread and a chipped map, promising a journey to the legendary city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Ys’s shimmering spires and magical fountains, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying suns painting the viewport.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The risks were far greater than any medieval journey – warp storms could tear their ship apart, unknown alien lifeforms lurked in the void, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel tested the crew's resilience.  But the promise of discovery, of finding new worlds and new civilizations, fueled their courage, making each perilous jump to hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking unknown.
