
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already tested their mettle – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager rations in dusty villages, and the ever-present fear of disease or violence.  Yet, with every league traversed, their resolve hardened, forged in the crucible of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  Facing down cosmic storms, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters, Eva relied on cutting-edge technology and a crew of hardened explorers.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking vistas and unimaginable wonders, but the risks were equally profound; a single miscalculation could mean the end of their expedition, or worse, the end of their lives.
