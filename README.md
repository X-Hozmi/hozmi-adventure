
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and spurred them across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal faint but persistent, whispering across the gulf of space.  Faster-than-light travel was taxing, both on the ship and its crew, but the promise of finding survivors, and understanding the colony's fate, kept the engines roaring and their spirits high.  The vastness of space was a terrifying yet awe-inspiring backdrop to their perilous journey.
