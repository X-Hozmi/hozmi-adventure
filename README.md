
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, the treacherous mud of flooded river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease were all commonplace.  Yet, the lure of the holy city, the camaraderie of the road, and the thrill of the unknown kept them pushing forward, each sunrise a fresh invitation to face whatever challenges lay ahead in this vast and unforgiving land.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking but treacherous backdrop to her intergalactic voyage. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of alien empires, Elara relied on her wits, her trusty crew, and cutting-edge technology to overcome the obstacles of this vast, uncharted cosmos.  The rewards, however, promised to redefine the very nature of space exploration.
