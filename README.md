
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the unwavering hope for her brother's healing spurred her across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure and survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, presumed destroyed, at the edge of known space.  Facing radiation storms, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure,  Ryla navigated the perilous expanse, driven by a duty to find survivors and a thirst for the uncharted wonders that lay beyond the familiar stars.
