
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost knowledge of the ancients.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the dwindling supplies in her saddlebags.  The adventure, though fraught with peril, ignited a fierce spirit within her, a thirst for the unknown that surpassed even the gnawing hunger in her belly.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos. His mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vastness of space held its own terrors - unpredictable spatial anomalies, pirate fleets lurking in the dark sectors, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the promise of rediscovering a lost civilization, of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled his every decision, a cosmic adventure far exceeding anything a medieval traveler could have imagined.
