
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and fear thick in the air.  Her worn leather map, a testament to countless rips and repairs, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Bandits were rumored to infest these heights, and the whispers of mythical beasts, half-forgotten in dusty tomes, sent shivers down her spine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised peril, but the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, with its promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet"  Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable currents of Xylos posed a unique challenge.  His seasoned crew monitored the ship's systems, their faces illuminated by the flickering holographic displays charting their course through the cosmic maelstrom.  The prize? A rumored planet teeming with Xylanium, a rare element vital to powering the faster-than-light engines of the Galactic Federation, and a fortune for those daring enough to claim it.  The risk was immense, the rewards potentially life-altering.
