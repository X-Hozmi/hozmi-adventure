
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest – to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness – felt as endless as the horizon itself.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  Yet, with every sunrise, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by the unwavering hope for her brother's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization clinging to the edge of explored space.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a daily struggle, but the allure of discovery surpassed any danger. The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its indifference, held both unimaginable peril and the promise of a forgotten world waiting to be rediscovered.
