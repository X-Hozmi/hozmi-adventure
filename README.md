
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d traded his family’s meager harvest for a place on this caravan bound for the fabled spice markets of the East.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the relentless rhythm of hooves on earth, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the ever-present threat of bandits, disease, and the unknown.  Each sunrise brought the promise of adventure, but also the harsh reality of a journey measured not in miles, but in sweat, fear, and dwindling supplies.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vastness of space dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys; the perils were different—hyper-space anomalies, rogue asteroids, the chilling silence of the void—but the thrill of discovery, the push against the boundaries of the known, remained a constant, a shared human yearning echoing across time and space.
