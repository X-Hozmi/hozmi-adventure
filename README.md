
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the rhythmic clip-clop of her mule a counterpoint to the gnawing fear in her gut.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were common, the terrain unforgiving, and every shadow held the potential for something worse.  Yet, the glint of hope, as bright as the distant, shimmering heat haze, spurred her onward.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for food in dusty villages, and evading the suspicious gazes of those who eyed her lone travels with distrust.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's navigation system.  Her mission: to locate and retrieve the lost artifact, the 'Heart of Aethel', rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey spanned galaxies, each jump a calculated risk across uncharted space, a gamble against the unknown dangers of wormholes and hostile alien factions.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer, possessed the unwavering spirit of her medieval predecessors, fuelled by an insatiable curiosity and the unwavering belief in her quest's ultimate worth.
