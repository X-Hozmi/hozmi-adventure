
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a chipped map and a dwindling supply of hardtack; her quest, to reach the legendary city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened its icy fingers on the land.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog, each whispered rumor of bandits and treacherous terrain, fueled her resolve. This journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was the only path to the knowledge she craved.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by a galaxy-spanning navigation system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, star-dusted silence of deep space.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immeasurable – alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions – but the potential reward was worth the gamble.
