
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a map promising untold riches in a distant kingdom, a map that whispered of treacherous mountain passes, bandit-infested forests, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder that survival, and perhaps fortune, lay in the next sunrise.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the kaleidoscopic swirls a far cry from the dusty trails of Elara's journey.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast emptiness of space.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – but the allure of the unknown, the intoxicating promise of discovery, remained the same driving force.
