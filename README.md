
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the unwavering hope for her brother's healing spurred her across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, its swirling colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated efficiency of her ship's controls. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a newly-colonized planet teetering on the brink of ecological collapse.  Warp jumps across lightyears and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks were commonplace hazards, but the weight of galactic responsibility, the hope for a burgeoning civilization, propelled her across the vast expanse of space, each jump a leap of faith towards a brighter future.
