
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a swirling brown cloud in the wake of their small company.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to be guarded by bog-things and worse, a necessary crossing on their perilous journey to the Sultan's court.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort of the horse, was a heartbeat in the symphony of their desperate quest – to retrieve the stolen relic and save their kingdom from ruin.  The vast unknown lay before them, filled with both promise and peril.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the *Starseeker*, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted across the viewport.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of their distance from the familiar comfort of Earth.  Ahead lay the possibility of first contact, the discovery of new life, or the crushing weight of interstellar emptiness.  The galaxy was their oyster, but the risks were unimaginable.
