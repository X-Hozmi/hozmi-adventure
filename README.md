
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and exhausted horses, slogged onward through the unforgiving French countryside.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where a single misstep could send man and beast tumbling to their doom, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, whispering promises of unimaginable riches and exotic lands beyond the known world, spurred us on, a flickering ember of hope in the heart of relentless hardship.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting thrum.  We were charting a course through the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in generations.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers born under the watchful gaze of different suns, faced their own challenges:  the crushing loneliness of interstellar space, the unpredictable nature of wormhole transit, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations. But the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, and new knowledge fuelled our relentless pursuit of the cosmic unknown.
