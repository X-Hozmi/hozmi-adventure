
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the Alps, rumored to hold the secret to curing the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her fear and her determination.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but obstacles in her desperate journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a mythical nebula said to contain a source of near-infinite energy, vital to the survival of her dying home planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were commonplace hazards. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to her people's future – a future that hung precariously in the balance with each hyperspace jump.
