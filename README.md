
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, propelled him forward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him not just a map, but a heart brimming with hope and the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the elusive Xylossian civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, stars blurred into streaks of light as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes.  The vastness of space, a canvas of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, presented a different kind of peril – the loneliness of interstellar travel, the potential for catastrophic equipment failure, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, like Thomas before her, Eva was driven by an indomitable spirit, fueled by the pursuit of discovery and the endless possibilities of the cosmos.
