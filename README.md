
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King, a perilous journey undertaken for a cause greater than herself.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her quest, each sunrise a gamble against the unpredictable dangers of medieval travel.  Yet, with every step, her resolve hardened, fueled by the urgency of her mission.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a journey fraught with the perils of warp storms and uncharted asteroid fields.  Advanced technology offered a degree of protection, but the vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos remained a constant reminder of the fragility of life, and the immense courage needed to explore the infinite.
