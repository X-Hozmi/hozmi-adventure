
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling to their deaths, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's resolve strengthened, fueled by hope and the unwavering bond with her brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and terror – unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of engine failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the thought of those colonists, clinging to life on a distant world, spurred Ryla onward, her courage a beacon in the endless darkness.
