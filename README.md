
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly across the light-years.

Navigation through asteroid fields, encounters with unknown spacefaring civilizations, and the constant hum of the ship's engines provided a different kind of adventure, one where the stakes were galactic in scale and the risks, potentially fatal.
