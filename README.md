
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear clinging to the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and whispered tales of monstrous beasts in the untamed forests chilled her to the bone.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the hope of finding Zerzura fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of terror – the unknown.  Uncharted systems held mysteries, both wondrous and deadly, and the potential for catastrophic engine failure was a constant, gnawing fear, overshadowed only by the hope of reaching Kepler-186f and delivering life-saving supplies.
