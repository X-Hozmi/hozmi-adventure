
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were minor inconveniences compared to the hope that fueled her journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to possess a unique energy source capable of saving her dying home planet.  Hyperspace jumps were perilous, fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  But the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the alien worlds glimpsed in fleeting moments between jumps, and the unwavering hope for survival kept her pushing forward through the infinite expanse of space.
