
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a scroll containing a rumored cure for the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of bandits, wild animals, or worse – the chilling grip of the disease itself. Her journey was a gamble against fate, a desperate dash across a land teeming with peril and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields surrounding the Kepler-186f system, she felt the familiar tremor of hyperspace jump resonate through her bones.  The mission: to retrieve a vital energy source before the Kryll Empire could claim it.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional burst of alien life signs on her scanners, posed a different but equally daunting challenge to the medieval journey,  one played out not on dirt paths, but across the infinite tapestry of the cosmos.
