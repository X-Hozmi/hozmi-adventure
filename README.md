
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from a leisurely journey. Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of disease tested her resilience at every turn.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unfamiliar paths, bartering for meager sustenance, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers. Yet, with every sunrise, her determination burned brighter, fueled by faith and the unwavering hope of reaching her sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the relentless effects of interstellar travel were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation, a stark contrast to the human drama unfolding within the confines of her ship.  The fate of a lost civilization rested on her shoulders, a burden both immense and exhilarating.
