
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France in fiery hues. His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a sacred relic capable of healing his plague-stricken village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the hope of salvation fueled his journey, driving him ever closer to his perilous destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum as it leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy, a civilization cut off from the rest of humanity for generations.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate fleets, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew, their courage tempered by the vastness of the cosmos and the weight of their responsibility to find those lost souls.
