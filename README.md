
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  The chill wind bit at my face as I urged my weary horse onward, the distant silhouette of the rumored Black Forest a looming promise of both peril and the potential riches whispered about in smoky taverns.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this pilgrimage, but the allure of the unknown, the whispered tales of forgotten magic and lost kingdoms, spurred me ever onward.  This journey, a gamble with fate itself, was the only life I knew.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  The swirling nebula outside the viewport painted a breathtaking canvas, a far cry from the muddy tracks of my ancestors.  My destination: Xylos, a planet teeming with rumored Xylean crystals, coveted for their unimaginable energy potential.  The risks remained the same – unpredictable space storms, pirate incursions, the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – yet the scale was unimaginable.  This wasn't a journey across a continent, but a leap across the gulf of stars, a gamble on a cosmic scale, fueled by the same insatiable human hunger for discovery.
