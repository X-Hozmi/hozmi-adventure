
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise bringing a new challenge and a renewed commitment to his perilous journey.  The weight of hope, and the fear of failure, spurred him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted space were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of the cosmos dwarfed her ship, a tiny speck against an unimaginable backdrop, but the strength of her crew and the urgency of their task fueled her unwavering determination to reach their destination, a vibrant new world promising a second chance for humanity.
