
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he spurred his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on his arduous journey.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, balanced against the gnawing fear of never reaching his destination, a fear that fueled his relentless pursuit across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace were all part of a day's work for the seasoned captain.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, also held the ever-present danger of the unknown, demanding both skill and courage in equal measure.
