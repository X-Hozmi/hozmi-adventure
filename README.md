His quest: to reach the rumored monastery high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for the plague sweeping his village.

The journey was perilous, fraught with asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of space pirates. Yet, the promise of unlocking interstellar travel spurred her onward, through the infinite expanse of the galaxy and beyond.
