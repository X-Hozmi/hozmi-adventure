
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary horse onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a gritty testament to the weeks spent traversing the unforgiving landscape.  Rumors of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and guarded by ancient magic, fuelled his perilous journey.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown, but the lure of adventure, whispered on the wind, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the vastness of space, brimming with unexplored worlds and alien wonders, held an irresistible allure.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility to her crew, and the sheer audacity of interstellar travel fueled her journey across the cosmic ocean.
