
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the dry undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the insidious whispers of the plague itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, punctuated by fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty and unexpected kindness from the scattered villages he encountered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all part of a daily routine.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, dwarfed even the grandest medieval expeditions.  Yet, the potential rewards – the discovery of new life, new worlds – fueled her relentless drive across the cosmic ocean.
