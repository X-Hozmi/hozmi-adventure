
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them onwards, their journey a tapestry woven with danger, camaraderie, and unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with strange flora and even stranger dangers.  Warp jumps between star systems were routine, but navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate vessels demanded precision and nerve.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the human drama unfolding within the ship's cramped confines, a drama that mirrored the struggles of Sir Kaelan and his medieval comrades in its own unique way.
