
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its creases mirroring the lines etched on her face by years of hardship.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a whispered legend promising untold riches and the escape from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant companions on her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential colony for humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes, she and her crew faced the vast unknown, the cold emptiness of space a stark contrast to the vibrant alien worlds they encountered.  The thrill of exploration, the constant challenge of interstellar travel, fuelled their determination – the future of humanity rested on their shoulders, a burden and a privilege all at once.
