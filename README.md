
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a harrowing adventure.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the endless expanse of the English countryside, beautiful yet unforgiving, tested their resilience. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory in their slow, arduous trek.  The promise of the cathedral, a beacon of hope, kept their spirits alive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva and her crew faced the vastness of space, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and deadly peril.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each sensor reading a potential warning, but the allure of discovery and the weight of their mission fueled their journey across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
