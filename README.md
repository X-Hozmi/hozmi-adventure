
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city of gold and magic, said to be hidden deep within the treacherous Whisperwind Mountains.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of Eldoria, and the glory it promised, spurred him onward through the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the dangers that stalked him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation was treacherous; navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate fleets were everyday occurrences.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely expanse punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comm-system. Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to forge a new future for humanity among the stars, outweighed the inherent risks, fueling Eva's determination to reach her destination and claim Kepler-186f for Earth.
