
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Iberian plains stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried figs and a well-thumbed map, a lifeline in this perilous journey to the Holy Land.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger, yet the promise of Jerusalem fueled her onward.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant hills, blurring the line between reality and mirage, a fitting metaphor for the uncertain path ahead.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson and gold dust swirling around her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos galaxy, a cluster rumored to hold habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel was still a risky undertaking, the jump gates unpredictable and prone to spatial anomalies.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovering new life and unknown worlds, outweighed the dangers.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of unimaginable wonders, waiting to be uncovered.
