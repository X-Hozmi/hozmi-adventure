
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, a tapestry of ancient oaks and whispering pines.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified his already heightened senses; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey to the Holy Land. The weight of his quest – to recover a sacred relic – pressed down upon him, heavier than any chainmail.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving expanse of space separating her from home.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all part of the job.  But the lure of discovery, the possibility of finding life beyond Earth, fuelled her determination, a fire brighter than any star.
