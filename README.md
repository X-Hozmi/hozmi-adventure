
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a warning of impending war.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation haunted her journey.  Yet, the fire in her belly, fueled by duty and a sliver of hope, spurred her onward towards her distant destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a rare element crucial to sustaining life on a dying colony planet light years away.  The vast, inky blackness of space offered a different kind of danger; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the thrill of interstellar travel, the challenge of conquering the unknown, kept Razor's heart pounding with an adrenaline-fueled rhythm that echoed the medieval adventurer's own.
