
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a welcome change from the stench of the battlefield he'd just fled. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in his eyes burned brighter than any campfire.

Centuries hence, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily struggle, but the thrill of exploration fueled her crew.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  The search for a new home for humanity was a perilous journey, but one they were willing to undertake, fueled by the indomitable spirit of discovery.
