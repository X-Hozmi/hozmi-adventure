
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Elara, had already taken them through dense forests haunted by brigands, across treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and over sun-baked deserts where mirages danced like cruel promises.  Each day brought new perils – starvation, exhaustion, the ever-present threat of bandits – but the unwavering faith of Sir Kaelan, and the youthful eagerness of Thomas, kept them moving towards their distant goal.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', her ship a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of the cosmos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region whispered to hold the secrets of faster-than-light travel.  Across light years they travelled, braving asteroid fields that threatened to shatter their vessel, navigating treacherous gravitational pulls, and facing the unknown wonders – and dangers – hidden within the nebula's vibrant clouds of gas and dust.  The universe was vast, but the human spirit, driven by curiosity and ambition, was even vaster.
