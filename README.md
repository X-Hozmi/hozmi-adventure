
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary horse onward.  Dust swirled around them, a gritty veil obscuring the relentless sun.  Their journey across the sprawling plains of Aquitaine was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a fragile victory, as Reginald pressed towards his unknown destiny, guided only by a tattered map and the whispers of an ancient prophecy.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held constant dangers – asteroid fields, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating in the lawless expanse between galaxies.  Eva, however, was undeterred, her determination fueled by the promise of discovery and the hope of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
