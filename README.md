
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city far to the east, burned in his saddlebag.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of distant spires, a beacon of hope through the endless expanse of rolling hills, spurred him onwards; a testament to human endurance against the vast and unforgiving medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-lost research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home.  The journey was fraught with perils – unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the constant threat of system malfunctions in the unforgiving vacuum of space. But the promise of scientific advancement, the allure of the unknown, fuelled her voyage across the galaxy, a testament to humanity’s insatiable curiosity and drive to explore the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
