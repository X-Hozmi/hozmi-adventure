
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I pressed onward, a biting wind whipping my cloak around me.  Ahead lay the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, a legendary barrier separating my homeland from the rumored city of Eldoria, a place said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each step was a gamble; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements were constant threats.  But the lure of Eldoria, the whispered tales of its wonders, spurred me on, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled my ears, a familiar comfort as we jumped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. My mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the derelict mining station orbiting Xylos, a planet notorious for its volatile atmosphere and aggressive Kryll lifeforms.  The galaxy was a vast, unpredictable ocean, and while the dangers of space travel were different from those faced by medieval travelers, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of discovery, remained a constant.  The journey, as ever, was the reward.
