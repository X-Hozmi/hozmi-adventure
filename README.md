
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their mettle.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, scavenging for food, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of the strangers they encountered in scattered villages.  Their destination felt as distant and elusive as the stars themselves.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the journey was punctuated by tense encounters with pirate fleets and the constant hum of the ship's aging engines.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered little comfort as Eva navigated the cosmic currents towards her unknown destiny.
