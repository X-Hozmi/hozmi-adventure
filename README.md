
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of mercenaries trudged onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of their packhorses, each rustle in the tall grass, sent shivers down their spines – for the road was fraught with peril; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation lurked around every bend.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, punctuated by fleeting moments of camaraderie and the ever-present hope of their final destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble to secure a vital resource for a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva and her crew faced challenges far beyond those of any medieval knight.  Warp jumps tested their ship's integrity, while alien encounters tested their courage, their loyalty, and their very survival. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a different kind of hardship than Kaelan had known, but the thirst for discovery and the hope of salvation remained a constant.
