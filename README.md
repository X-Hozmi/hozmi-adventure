
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on her sun-weathered face.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unforgiving terrain tested her strength at every pass.  But the whispered promise of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing brother, spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was as much a test of spirit as it was of endurance.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant cosmic dust painting ephemeral masterpieces across his viewport. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was routine, but the vastness of space, the sheer impossibility of the task, sometimes felt overwhelming. Yet, the faint signal he'd intercepted, a desperate plea for help, fueled his relentless pursuit across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
