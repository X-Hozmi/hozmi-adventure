
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a clumsy serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress toward the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the relentless heat, yet the lure of untold riches and forgotten lore propels us onward.  The creak of wagon wheels and the bleating of sheep are the soundtrack to our perilous journey, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship humming with controlled chaos, navigates the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos cluster, rumored to contain life-sustaining minerals vital to the survival of our dying planet.  Vast distances and unforeseen celestial phenomena pose a constant danger, but the hope of salvation outweighs the risks.  The hum of the engines and the starlight reflected on the control panels accompany us, a counterpoint to the silent immensity of space.
