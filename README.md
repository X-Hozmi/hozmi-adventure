
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a shimmering jewel whispered about in taverns and sung of by bards – a city of untold riches and even more perilous secrets.  Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant threats, testing the mettle of Thomas and his small band of companions as they traversed treacherous mountain passes and dense, foreboding forests, their journey a constant dance between hope and despair.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a nebula of iridescent gases.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a beautiful and terrifying expanse, presented challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of solar flares, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, a thrilling and dangerous undertaking in the pursuit of discovery.
