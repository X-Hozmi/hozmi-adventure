He'd left the familiar fields of his village weeks ago, seeking fortune and adventure in the distant city of Prague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of both wonder and peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the medieval landscape.  He clung to the hope that Prague held more than just hardship, fueled by whispered tales of bustling markets and glittering courts.


Centuries later, Elara piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.

But Elara, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the cosmos, felt the thrill of the void coursing through her veins.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human understanding, made it all worthwhile.
