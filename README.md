
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's untold riches and the thrill of the unknown fuel our weary steps, pushing us ever onward despite the hardships. We are bound together not by blood, but by shared ambition and the relentless pull of the adventure itself.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel capable of warping through spacetime, carries me and my crew across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our mission: to locate a rumored lost colony of human settlers.  The breathtaking nebulae and alien planets encountered are beyond anything I could have imagined – wonders of iridescent gas giants and shimmering crystal canyons. Yet, the vast emptiness of space is a constant companion, a silent reminder of the peril we face. A malfunctioning warp drive, a rogue asteroid field, or the unknown inhabitants of a new planet – any could be our last.
