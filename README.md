
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Alps.  Each pass presented a new challenge – icy slopes threatening to send me tumbling into the abyss, blizzards that obscured the path, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred me onward.  The promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge fueled my weary body and resolute spirit.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Stars streaked past like cosmic fireflies as we hurtled towards the Xylos system, a journey that would take generations for slower vessels.  The thrill wasn't just the speed, but the unknown – Xylos was uncharted territory, a swirling nebula teeming with potential new life forms and resources, but also unpredictable dangers.  Our mission: to map the system and establish a forward base, a small step for humanity, but a giant leap into the unfathomable wonders of the cosmos.
