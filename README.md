
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the whispering forests of Eldoria, rumored to hold both untold riches and unspeakable dangers.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new river to ford, a new mountain to traverse, the lure of adventure tempered by the harsh realities of medieval travel; survival was the ultimate prize.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets and galaxies, yet the thrill of exploration remained.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a potential encounter with alien civilizations – friendly or hostile – or the terrifying emptiness of the void. The vastness of space presented a different kind of hardship, but the allure of discovery, the promise of new worlds, was just as potent as any medieval quest.
