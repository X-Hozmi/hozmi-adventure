
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving plains of Anatolia stretching before them like a sea of brown.  Their journey to the Crusader States had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival, as they pushed onward, spurred by a mixture of religious zeal, mercenary ambition, and a desperate yearning for the fabled riches of the East.  Their only companions were the relentless sun, the whispering wind, and the unwavering clink of their armour.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Captain Eva Rostova's ears as they jumped between galaxies.  Unlike the medieval travelers before her, she navigated not by the stars visible to the naked eye, but by complex astrogation charts and the ship's sophisticated AI.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies that could crush their ship, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids across the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, like Sir Kaelan, Eva was driven by a thirst for the unknown, a need to explore the mysteries of the cosmos, even if it meant facing oblivion at every turn.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, a world as distant and uncharted as the fabled East.
