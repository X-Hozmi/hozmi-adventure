
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a scrabbling tapestry of humans and beasts, creaks across the parched plains of Anatolia.  The midday sun beats down on our sun-baked faces, a stark contrast to the icy bite of the mountain passes we'd recently traversed.  Each day brings the risk of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies. Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city whispered to be paved in gold, keeps our weary hearts beating.  Every creak of the cart, every bray of a donkey, marks another step closer to adventure, to fortune, or perhaps, to ruin.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways. The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and pulsating energy, jumps between constellations.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates the treacherous nebulae and avoids the predatory space pirates that prowl the black.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned spacers, seeks a legendary lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey is fraught with peril, from gravitational anomalies to sentient space storms, but the promise of uncovering forgotten knowledge fuels their relentless pursuit across the vast, unknowable cosmos.
