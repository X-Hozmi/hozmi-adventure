
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope in Eldoria's rumored riches, and the desperate love for his sister, pushed him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the quarantined colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with its own dangers – volatile wormholes, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the knowledge that lives hung in the balance, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted cosmos, fueled her determination to complete her perilous interstellar voyage.
