
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as we navigated treacherous mountain passes and skirted bandit-infested forests.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges:  fording swollen rivers, bartering for supplies in dusty market towns, and constantly watching for the glint of hostile steel.  The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, and the lure of distant Constantinople fueled our weary steps.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel of shimmering alloys, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Captain Elara Vance charted a course through nebulae of impossible beauty and navigated asteroid fields with practiced ease.  Our mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards – a future free from galactic war – far outweighed the risks.
