
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he urged the beast onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the unwavering hope for his sister's recovery fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape, transforming every hardship into a step closer to his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant hum of potential engine failure. Yet, Eva, a seasoned spacefarer, navigated the cosmos with unwavering determination, her resolve hardened by the knowledge that countless lives depended on her safe arrival.  The vastness of space held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying uncertainty, a stark contrast to the medieval journeys of her ancestors, but the spirit of adventure remained the same.
