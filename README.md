
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather boots of Thomas as he urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only respite the occasional shade of a gnarled olive tree.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones amongst the desert nomads, drove him relentlessly. Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in rocky canyons, scorching heat threatening sunstroke, and the ever-present fear of losing his way in the unforgiving wilderness.  He carried only a worn map, a waterskin, and the unwavering hope of finding fortune and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal distortions were just part of the daily routine.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, testing the limits of her ship and her courage.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of the universe, fueled her onward.
