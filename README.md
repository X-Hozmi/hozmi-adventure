
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land.  Her quest, to find the lost monastery rumored to hold a sacred relic, pushed her onward despite the perils.  The journey was fraught with hardship: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  The jump to Xylos, a planet famed for its sentient crystal forests, was risky, the warp drive pushing the vessel to its limits.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the opportunistic scavengers that preyed on interstellar travelers were commonplace hazards. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held far greater unknowns than any medieval landscape, but the allure of discovery was just as potent, a siren song beckoning her towards the galactic unknown.
