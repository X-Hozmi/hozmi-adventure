
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions.  Yet, the glint of the rumored gold and the promise of uncovering ancient secrets fueled her onward, each sunrise bringing a renewed sense of desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a commonplace hazard on her intergalactic trade routes.  The bounty of rare minerals and alien artifacts she sought was worth the risk, the vastness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown, but the thrill of exploration burned brighter than any fear.
