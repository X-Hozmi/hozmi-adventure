
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, has led him through treacherous mountain passes, across swollen rivers, and into the heart of bandit-infested forests. Each sunrise brings a new challenge – starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the unwavering faith fueling his journey keeps him pressing onward, hoping to reach his sacred destination before winter’s icy grip claims him. The camaraderie of fellow travelers, forged in shared hardship, offers a meager solace against the vastness and peril of the land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy, hidden on a remote planet within a galaxy far from her home in the Sol Federation.  Navigation charts are unreliable, and hyperspace jumps are fraught with the risk of spatial anomalies and pirate attacks.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presents a constant challenge, requiring unwavering skill, quick thinking, and a steadfast crew to overcome the hazards and reach their coveted prize. The journey is a test of their resilience, their courage, and the bonds of friendship forged under the cold light of distant stars.
