
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the overcast sky, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had taken them through dense forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned, and over sun-baked deserts where water was more precious than gold.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating by the stars to bartering for supplies in unfamiliar villages, a constant test of courage, resilience, and resourcefulness. The adventure was perilous, but the allure of the unknown, the promise of salvation, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth. The journey wasn't just measured in distance, but in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, the constant threat of space pirates, and the ever-present hum of the ship's aging engines.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Reginald's medieval trek, Eva faced a different kind of peril; the loneliness of space, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the sheer daunting scale of the interstellar void. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, charting unmapped galaxies, ignited a thirst for adventure just as potent as that felt by knights of old.
