
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Michael, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was perilous, a tapestry woven with hardship and the slim hope of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the ancient whispers of the Kryll navigators.  Beyond the shimmering veil lay the Andromeda galaxy, a destination fraught with unknown dangers – alien leviathans, treacherous gravity wells, and the ever-present threat of pirates who preyed on interstellar traders.  But the promise of untold riches and scientific discovery fueled her unwavering determination, a modern-day echo of the medieval pilgrims' faith, driving her towards the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
