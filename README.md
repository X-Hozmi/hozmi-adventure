
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the next hill, the scent of pine and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered of in hushed tones, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation have tested her resolve. Yet, the glint of a distant spire, impossibly shimmering through the haze, fuels her onward.  Each hardship, each breathtaking vista, solidifies her determination to reach her destination, a place promised to hold the secrets of a forgotten age.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra navigates the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet, is measured not in days but in light-years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  While pirates and asteroid fields present a different kind of danger than bandits and blizzards, the yearning for discovery remains the same. The endless expanse of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, offers a profound solitude, punctuated by the crackling hum of the ship and the camaraderie of her crew as they venture into the unknown, seeking a new home amongst the stars.
