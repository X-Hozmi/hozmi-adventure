The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen Orb of Aethelred, led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadow of crumbling, forgotten castles.
