
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He was bound for the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the travelers, and the vast, unforgiving desert threatened to swallow him whole. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in his relentless quest for the legendary city.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigation was treacherous, the void teeming with unpredictable gravitational currents and pirate fleets from the Andromeda Galaxy.  With her loyal crew, Eva faced down alien predators, navigated treacherous asteroid fields, and battled the ever-present threat of system failure in a relentless race against time to find the lost colonists and unravel the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance.
