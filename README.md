
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its edges frayed from countless journeys.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of starvation were constant companions, but the lure of the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward.  Each creaking step of her mount was a gamble, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where the road itself was as much a challenge as any foe.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy stretched before her, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and unimaginable dangers.  Wormholes shimmered on the edge of sensor range, offering shortcuts through the fabric of spacetime, but with each jump came the risk of encountering unpredictable gravitational forces or hostile alien fleets.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey that tested not only her piloting skills, but also the resilience of her crew and the limits of human ambition.
