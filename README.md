
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape, a tapestry of sun-baked hills and shadowed forests.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a stark reminder of the perils faced by those who dared to venture beyond the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity's desperate exodus from a dying Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was a relentless dance with cosmic hazards – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  Unlike Reginald's journey across a single world, Eva's voyage spanned the immensity of space, each star a beacon of hope, each passing nebula a reminder of the vast, unforgiving beauty of the universe.
