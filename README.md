
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the sheer vastness of the journey tested both body and spirit. Each sunrise brought new challenges:  fording treacherous rivers, navigating by the stars, relying on the kindness (or cruelty) of strangers. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to witness the world beyond his village, spurred him relentlessly west.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the inky blackness towards the Xylos system.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, potentially hostile alien lifeforms. But the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly, fueled by the limitless expanse of space and the promise of discovery beyond human comprehension.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble with fate, but the vastness of the galaxy beckoned, irresistible and awe-inspiring.
