
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, urged his destrier onward.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the rutted track, the air thick with the scent of pine and woodsmoke.  His quest – to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys before the winter snows choked the mountain passes – was a perilous one.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held untold dangers – from rogue gravitational wells to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission, to establish a new colony, carried the weight of humanity's future.
