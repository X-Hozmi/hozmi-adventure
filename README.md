
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara’s small caravan pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Zerzura, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons, the desert threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present fear of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and constantly battling the elements.  Their reward, if they survived, was a legend whispered on the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust*.  The journey between galaxies was a relentless test of both ship and crew; navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging rogue plasma storms, and repairing warp drive malfunctions were commonplace. The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold resources and new life.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Jax’s crew faced the cold void of space, the threat of unknown alien species, and the ever-present danger of equipment failure.  Their reward, if they survived, was the potential to reshape the future of humanity.
