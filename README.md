
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the unpredictable, fueled his journey, pushing him ever closer to the heart of the desert and the potential fulfillment of his impossible dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal barely detectable even by the most advanced sensors.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal test of both machine and human endurance, the constant stress of navigating asteroid fields and battling gravitational anomalies a constant companion.  But the promise of finding survivors, of understanding the mystery of their disappearance, drove Eva and her crew through the cosmic void, toward the edge of known space and a destiny yet unwritten.
