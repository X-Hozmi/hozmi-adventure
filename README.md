
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains a secret map promising untold riches hidden within a forgotten monastery. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are just some of the obstacles standing between her and her goal.  Each sunrise brings new dangers, but the allure of adventure, the whisper of fortune, fuels her relentless journey across the medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps across light years, dodging asteroid fields and pirate vessels, are commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space is a thrilling and terrifying playground, a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single life against the breathtaking scale of the galaxy, but Jax's courage and determination burn brighter than any star.
