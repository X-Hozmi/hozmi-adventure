
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the rutted track, their destination the fabled city of Samarkand.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the sting of biting winds, the warmth of crackling campfires under star-dusted skies, and the constant threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the ever-present uncertainty of finding enough sustenance to survive.  Yet, the allure of the East, whispered in tales of silks and spices, spurred them onward, fueled by a thirst for adventure and a yearning for the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Jax's starship *Stardust* pierced the nebula, its engines a low hum against the breathtaking cosmic ballet of swirling colours.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage that spanned light-years and untold risks.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue planetoids, and facing the unpredictable anomalies of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The crew, bound by the shared thrill of discovery and the vastness of the universe, faced each challenge with unwavering courage, their hearts filled with the awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying dangers of the cosmos.
