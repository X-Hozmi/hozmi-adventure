
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and encroaching war.  Every creak of the saddle, every distant raven's cry, was a note in the symphony of her perilous journey – a testament to the courage it took to navigate the treacherous roads, evade bandit gangs, and rely on the kindness of strangers in a time when survival was a daily struggle.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  This wasn't a journey of mere survival, but of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human understanding.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, held its own dangers – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of the unknown. Yet, the promise of discovery fueled her every decision, a testament to humanity's unyielding thirst for adventure amongst the stars.
