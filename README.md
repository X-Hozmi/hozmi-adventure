
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza and deliver a vital message to her exiled brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present fear of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed commitment to her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a diplomatic exchange with the enigmatic Kryll species inhabiting the Kepler-186f system, light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate raid was all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar captain.  But the true challenge lay in understanding the Kryll culture, their complex customs a far greater hurdle than any gravitational anomaly or warp-core malfunction.  The vastness of space held untold wonders, but also equally untold dangers.
