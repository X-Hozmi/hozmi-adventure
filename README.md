
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the rivers threatened swift currents and treacherous fords, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – negotiating with suspicious villagers, fording swollen streams on rickety bridges, and constantly being on guard against the unpredictable dangers of the untamed landscape.  Their adventure was one of grit, resilience, and unwavering faith, a testament to the human spirit's ability to conquer hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing vital systems under constant threat of cosmic radiation were just a few of the challenges she faced. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of rediscovering humanity's lost kin fueled her determination and spurred her crew onward across the infinite expanse of space.
