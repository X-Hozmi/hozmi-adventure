
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaked across the parched plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, while scorching heat and dwindling water supplies tested our resilience.  The whispered tales of mythical cities and monstrous beasts spurred us onward, a potent brew of fear and ambition fueling our journey to the fabled spice markets of the East.  The vastness of the unknown, a tapestry woven with danger and wonder, stretched before us, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highways.  The sleek, chrome hull of the *Stardust Drifter* cut through the inky blackness between galaxies, the swirling nebulae painting breathtaking masterpieces across our viewport.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets and alien civilizations.  While the dangers were different—the threat of void storms, rogue asteroids, and unknown extraterrestrial life—the spirit of adventure remained the same, a yearning to push the boundaries of the known and unravel the cosmic mysteries that lay hidden amongst the stars.
