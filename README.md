
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara, her worn leather satchel bouncing against her hip, urged her mule onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements were constant companions on this arduous journey, a test of courage and resilience far surpassing any tale spun in the village tavern.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby against the vast, silent expanse of space.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of space pirates – the adventurous spirit remained.  The quest for the new, the unknown, pulsed through her veins, a timeless echo of the journeys undertaken by her medieval predecessors.
