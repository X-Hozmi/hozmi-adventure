
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under the pale sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, its shadows whispering tales of brigands and mythical beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a thrill of anticipation and apprehension through him.  He carried King Edward's missive, a perilous journey to a distant vassal, a journey fraught with danger, but also brimming with the intoxicating allure of the unknown.  His destination lay beyond the mountains, a land of rumour and legend, a land that held the key to the kingdom's salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The crimson and gold gas clouds painted the cockpit in ethereal hues as her ship navigated the treacherous asteroid field.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the cure for a galaxy-wide plague.  The jump coordinates were unstable, the journey fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation and uncharted space, but the potential reward, the chance to save countless lives, fuelled her unwavering determination.  The vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos held both terrifying beauty and untold possibilities.
