
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the distance, fueled his weary steps, driving him across kingdoms and through perilous landscapes.  He was a humble man on a monumental journey, his fate intertwined with the fate of his sister.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming microbes to Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered breathtaking vistas of celestial wonders alongside the ever-present danger of malfunctioning systems and the unknown lurking in the cosmic dark. The fate of a potential new home for humanity rested on her shoulders, a far cry from the medieval pilgrimages of her ancestors.
