
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden highlands to reach King Edward's besieged castle was fraught with peril.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine. He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, his gaze constantly scanning for the telltale glint of steel or the dark shadow of a lurking wolf pack.  The promise of glory and the King's gratitude fuelled his weary body, driving him ever closer to his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable spatial anomalies that warped reality itself.  The vast, inky blackness of space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant, alien landscapes that occasionally flashed past her viewport.  The weight of the galaxy’s mysteries, and the hope of unlocking its secrets, rested on her shoulders.
