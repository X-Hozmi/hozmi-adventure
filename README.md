
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden passes of the Pyrenees was far from the romantic tales told in taverns.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down her spine, and the ever-present gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, the promise of the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones, fuelled her weary steps, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents between galaxies was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape back on the Sol system.  Her mission: to secure a rare mineral vital for interstellar travel, a journey requiring deft piloting through asteroid fields and close encounters with hostile alien scavengers.  The thrill of exploration far outweighed the risks, the vast expanse of the cosmos a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities, and the potential dangers, that lay ahead.
