
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke clinging to the wind.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of a journey across a continent riven by war and famine.  The maps were unreliable, the paths treacherous, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, they dodged asteroid fields and charted unmapped wormholes, their destination a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The thrill was not in the destination, but in the journey itself – a dance with the unknown, a test of courage and skill against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Each jump was a gamble, each system a potential graveyard.
