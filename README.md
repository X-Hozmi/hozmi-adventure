
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving landscape itself.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the far-flung galactic colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was all in a day's work, but the breathtaking vistas of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies filled him with a sense of awe and wonder that rivaled any terrestrial adventure. The vastness of space, though perilous, was equally captivating.
