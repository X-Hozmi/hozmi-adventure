
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered legends of the monastery, and the unwavering love for her brother, fueled her onward, transforming every hardship into a step closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling cosmic radiation, and repairing critical systems in the vacuum of space were commonplace.  The vastness of the universe, both terrifying and exhilarating, held its breath as Ryla steered her vessel towards a new dawn, a future for humanity contingent on her success, the fate of a new world resting on her shoulders.
