
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s worn leather boots as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Each step was a gamble, the path fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The wind whispered secrets through the tall grasses, a constant companion on this perilous journey, carrying both the scent of impending rain and the faint hope of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula, her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, speckled with vibrant star clusters and ominous dark matter, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates were just another day’s work for Eva, her courage fueled by the potential to revolutionize interstellar travel and bring unity to the fractured galactic community.
