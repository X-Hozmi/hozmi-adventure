
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, the constant threat of bandits and wild beasts a shadow ever-present.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: a broken wagon wheel demanding repairs, a whispered rumour of plague in the next village, the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, shimmering in the distant haze, spurs us onward.  The journey itself is the adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the raw beauty of a world untamed.


Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a generation ship boasting faster-than-light capabilities, cuts a lonely path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  We are explorers, pioneers charting uncharted territories, facing perils far beyond bandit raids and river crossings.  Warp-core malfunctions, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms are just some of the hazards we face.  But the promise of discovery, the hope of finding a new home amongst the stars, fuels our relentless journey across the cosmic ocean.
