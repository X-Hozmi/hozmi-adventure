
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats and a well-thumbed map, its creases mirroring the lines etched on her face from months of relentless travel.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary city of Ys, hidden somewhere in this wilderness, fuelled her onward.  The adventure, however perilous, was her lifeblood.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was measured not in days, but in years, a testament to the vast distances between stars.  Eva’s crew, a diverse band bound by shared ambition and a thirst for the unknown, navigated asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps, their sensors constantly scanning for anomalies and potential threats from alien lifeforms. The thrill of exploration, the allure of undiscovered planets teeming with strange and wondrous creatures, far outweighed the inherent risks of galactic travel.
