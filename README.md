
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse. My meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of bread hard as a rock, and a rusty sword – felt inadequate against the unknown.  Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, but the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches, spurred me onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones.  Stars blurred past in streaks of incandescent color as we jumped between galaxies, the destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially habitable.  My mission, as a xenobiologist, was to assess its viability for human colonization.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was also terrifyingly isolating.  The thought of encountering alien life, both friendly and hostile, made the risks of this interstellar voyage exponentially greater than any medieval journey could ever be.
