
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of parchment and faded ink, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh indifference of nature itself.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart; it was a desperate gamble against the odds, a testament to the unwavering bonds of family.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders patrolling the black.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, fueled her courage, pushing her ever onward across the inky gulf between worlds.
