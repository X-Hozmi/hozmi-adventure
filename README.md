
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the dusty plains.  Each creak of the saddle leather and snort from his horse echoed the anxieties in his heart.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles in his path, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward, his determination as unyielding as the iron in his sword.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula painted across the inky canvas of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems during hyperspace jumps were all part of the routine.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, but the thrill of exploration and the possibility of discovering new life and civilizations fueled her relentless journey across the vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
