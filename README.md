The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – jagged peaks clawed at the sky, while shadowed valleys whispered of bandits and worse.  Each day brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and outsmarting the ever-present threat of wild beasts.
