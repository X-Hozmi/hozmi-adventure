
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of exotic spices and shimmering silks from the far East. His quest: to find a lost monastery rumored to hold the key to an ancient prophecy.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, the constant threat of bandits or the harsh realities of nature a constant companion to his ambition.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially habitable.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking emptiness of space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and encountering alien civilizations, fuelled her unwavering determination. The adventure of space travel was far removed from the dangers of medieval journeys, but the thrill of exploration, the excitement of discovering something new, remained a constant.
