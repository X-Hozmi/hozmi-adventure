
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her sweat-soaked skin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her.  She carried a King's ransom – not gold, but a sacred relic – clutched tightly to her chest, pursued by shadowy figures whose motivations remained as mysterious as the winding mountain paths themselves. Her journey was a constant dance between survival and faith, a test of endurance against the brutal beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, stretched before her.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the galaxy.  The quest for a new home, for a new beginning, was a voyage far more perilous, but no less thrilling, than any medieval pilgrimage across treacherous lands.
