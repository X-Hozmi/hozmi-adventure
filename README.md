
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, carrying a vital message that could determine the fate of his village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mix of fear and determination as he pressed on, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across light-years of unexplored space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships, Eva relied on her instincts and advanced technology to overcome the dangers of the cosmos, the vast emptiness amplifying both the loneliness of the journey and the weight of her responsibility.
