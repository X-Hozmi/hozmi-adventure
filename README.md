
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary beasts, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we journey towards the fabled city of Samarkand, a whisper of silk and spice carried on the wind.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Samarkand's magnificence, fuels our onward push, our hearts beating in time with the rhythmic clop of hooves on hardened earth.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The 'Starseeker', a vessel humming with the energy of a thousand suns, navigates the nebula of Orion, its destination a planet orbiting Kepler-186f.  Our mission: to chart unexplored territories, search for signs of life, and uncover the mysteries hidden within the swirling cosmic dust.  The vast expanse of space, a canvas of shimmering galaxies and unfathomable distances, both terrifies and enthralls.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving nature of the cosmos.
