
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath of her aging beast, mirrored the perilous journey ahead.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the whispers of a mythical city, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother, spurred her onward. The rough-hewn map, a tattered heirloom, was her only guide through this labyrinth of rock and shadow, a testament to the bravery and desperation that drove her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, terrifying emptiness of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, mapping a course through asteroid fields and radiation storms – dangers far removed from the medieval perils, yet equally formidable.  The success of her mission, the survival of the colony ship trailing behind, rested on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any mountain range.
