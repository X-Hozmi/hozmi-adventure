In the medieval era, adventure truly began the moment one stepped beyond the familiar gates of their village or town. Journeys across untamed lands were arduous and perilous, with every mile presenting a new challenge, be it treacherous forest trails, bandit-infested roads, or the whims of nature. Relying on horseback, stout boots, and often little more than a rough map or a rumor, travelers faced an unknown world filled with both mundane and mythical dangers, where survival often hinged on wit, courage, and a sturdy blade.

Yet, for those brave enough to embrace the unknown, the rewards were immeasurable. Beyond the perilous passes and dense forests lay bustling trade cities, ancient forgotten ruins, and the chance to witness wonders few would ever see. It was an era where the world felt vast and largely uncharted, offering true discovery and a profound sense of self-reliance for the intrepid soul who dared to explore it.
