
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward through the mud-choked lanes of a forgotten forest.  Each creak of saddle leather and whinny of our exhausted mounts was a testament to the arduous journey across the continent.  We sought the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of immense power, a pilgrimage fuelled by equal parts greed and scholarly curiosity.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease tested our mettle, yet the allure of the unknown spurred us onwards, towards the horizon's fading light.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highways.  The crimson nebula of Xylos burned in the viewport as the *Stardust Drifter*, our generation ship, warped through the fabric of spacetime.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable worlds and the remnants of an ancient, interstellar civilization.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present danger of cosmic radiation were a constant companion, but the thrill of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the universe, outweighed the risk.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble towards the ultimate adventure.
