
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving peaks of the Pyrenees.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders spurred him on, a beacon in the harsh realities of his medieval journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble to secure vital resources for a dwindling Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the routine.  Unlike Sir Reginald, she had technology on her side, but the vastness of space presented its own unique brand of terrifying uncertainty.  The fate of countless lives rested on the successful completion of her perilous galactic voyage.
