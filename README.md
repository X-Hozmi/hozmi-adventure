
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to Constantinople was a perilous one, fraught with bandits lurking in shadowed forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges:  fording icy rivers, navigating dense, unfamiliar woodlands teeming with unseen dangers, and bartering for meagre provisions in dusty, forgotten villages. His quest – to find a legendary lost scroll rumored to hold the secrets of a powerful, forgotten magic – fueled his weary steps, pushing him ever closer to his uncertain destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*, a kaleidoscope of nebulae swirling outside.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a region rumored to hold habitable planets beyond human understanding.  The journey was less about physical danger, and more about the constant hum of the hyperdrive, the ever-present threat of navigational anomalies, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of the cosmos, but the promise of discovery spurred her onward, a beacon in the inky black.
