
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but a single, fragile seed – a vital component in a rumored cure for the Black Death ravaging her village.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions on this perilous journey across Europe, a desperate gamble for the future of her people. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, testing her courage and resilience against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Nova'  navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust*. His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the uncharted galaxies beyond known space.  The journey is fraught with dangers far exceeding those faced by Elara.  Warp jumps threaten to tear his ship apart, hostile alien races lurk in the void, and the ever-present risk of navigational errors could strand him light-years from civilization. Yet, fuelled by hope and advanced technology, he pushes onward, charting new territories and facing the cosmic unknowns of a future far removed from the medieval world.
