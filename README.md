Tales whispered of streets paved with gold and a king who showered riches upon those who proved their worth. Each day brought new challenges - treacherous mountain passes, cunning bandits, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.

Captain Lyra adjusted her helmet, gazing at the swirling nebulas through the viewport of her starship. The journey to the Andromeda Galaxy, a lifetime away, was daunting, but she was determined to uncover the secrets of the ancient civilization that had once called it home.
