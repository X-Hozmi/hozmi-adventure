
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, a testament to countless creases and tear-repairs, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled both her apprehension and her burning desire for discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges she faced in her quest across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifted unnaturally, and the vastness of space pressed in, a constant reminder of the fragility of her ship and the monumental risks she faced –  alien encounters, unforeseen celestial events, and the ever-present threat of system failure all stood between her and the completion of her ambitious intergalactic journey.
