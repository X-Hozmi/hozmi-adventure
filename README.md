
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest, to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, led her through treacherous mountain passes, across whispering plains haunted by bandits, and finally, to a hidden river choked with reeds, its course a secret only whispered among the oldest villagers.  Each day brought new dangers: starvation, sickness, and the ever-present threat of violence. But the allure of the lost city, and the whispers of untold riches and magic within its depths, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for hyperspace navigation. Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the quarantined colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unique and potentially dangerous flora.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading opportunistic pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political maneuvering required to reach her destination. The galaxy, vast and unforgiving, presented its own unique challenges, but the promise of saving lives fueled her journey across the stars.
