
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the road, and the ever-present fear of the unknown territories ahead.  We seek the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and unimaginable wonders, but the journey itself, fraught with peril and punctuated by breathtaking vistas, is already a treasure beyond measure.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The *Stardust Drifter*, our generation ship, hums with the quiet power of its fusion engines as we traverse the void between galaxies.  Nebulae paint cosmic masterpieces across our viewports, while automated systems monitor for gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  We journey not for gold or glory, but for the promise of a new beginning, a habitable planet light years away, a chance to rebuild and reimagine humanity's future among the tapestry of the cosmos.
