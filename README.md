
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Rocamadour, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, and the treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve at every turn.  Yet, the thought of her loved ones, trapped within the castle's walls, spurred her onwards, a beacon against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's navigation systems.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would push the limits of both ship and crew.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failure. But Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, was prepared to face any challenge to reach her destination and ensure the colony's survival.
