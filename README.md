
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, the rivers are treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, from navigating confusing mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in sleepy villages.  But the promise of reaching the papal court, and the chance to deliver her father's vital message, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaps across the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae outside her viewport shift and swirl, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in warped spacetime and the chilling silence of interstellar travel.   Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a desperate leap of faith into the unpredictable vastness of the universe.
