
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crest the windswept hill.  Their journey across the fractured kingdom of Eldoria is fraught with peril; bandit lords control the passes, famine stalks the countryside, and whispers of a plague cloud the horizon.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain paths, bartering for meager supplies in distrustful villages, and evading the watchful eyes of those who would steal her precious cargo – a single, fragile seed said to hold the promise of a bountiful harvest.  But Elara presses on, driven by hope and a stubborn spirit forged in hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate and secure the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded after a catastrophic warp-core breach.  The vastness of space is a lonely place, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the static crackle of her comms.  She faces the constant threat of asteroid fields, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present danger of pirate raiders. Yet,  Jax, fuelled by unwavering loyalty to her crew and the hope of finding survivors, charts a course through the unknown, guided by the faintest whisper of a signal from a dying world.
