
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that mirrored the swirling anxieties in their hearts. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Ys, and the hope it represented, fueled their relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her heart a steady beat against the hum of the Alcubierre drive.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the ever-present threat of solar flares were all part of the voyage. But the promise of a new world, teeming with undiscovered wonders and the chance to forge a new destiny among the stars, outweighed the dangers a thousand times over.
