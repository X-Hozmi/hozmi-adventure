
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air. Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map – a guide to the legendary Sunstone rumored to lie hidden in the remote mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain all stood between her and her quest.  Fellow travelers, few and far between, offered fleeting companionship and cautionary tales of treacherous passes and ghostly apparitions.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Razor" Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond humanity's reach.  The journey was a symphony of hyperspace jumps and tense moments of navigating asteroid fields, each a gamble against the unforgiving void.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, and the crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, relied on their trust in each other to overcome the cosmic obstacles and reach their audacious goal.
