
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin bore the scars of countless scrapes and brushes with thorny bushes, a testament to the months spent traversing the treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the rumored city of gold, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon of her dreams, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation console.  Her journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a voyage measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, a pilgrimage across the cosmic ocean.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration, the unwavering pursuit of the unknown, resonated with the same fierce spirit that had driven Elara centuries before.
