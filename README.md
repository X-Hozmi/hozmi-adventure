
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel holding all she owned.  The journey to Avignon was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the relentless heat threatened to sap her strength.  But the promise of a new life, a chance to escape the poverty of her village, spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk cry, was a testament to the unpredictable beauty and harsh reality of medieval travel.  She carried the weight of hope, and the fear of the unknown, on her weary shoulders.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant lullaby against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic vastness.  Unlike the limited horizons of medieval travel, Eva's journey was one of almost limitless possibility, but equally fraught with danger.  Navigation through unstable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks demanded unwavering focus and skill.  Yet, the sheer scale of her adventure, the promise of discovery among distant stars, made the risk worthwhile.
