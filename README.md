
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, bounced against her hip.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Ys, a whispered legend promising untold riches and a path to escape her village's grinding poverty.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her terror and her unwavering determination to reach the mythical haven, facing bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation with gritted teeth and a heart full of hope.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a hypnotic backdrop to the perilous jump into uncharted space.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The ship groaned under the strain of the hyperspace jump, its AI, a sardonic entity named HAL-E, spouting warnings about gravitational anomalies and potential asteroid fields.  The stakes were high – galactic domination rested on the success of this mission, a race against rival corporations and the ever-present threat of cosmic storms that could obliterate his ship in an instant.
