
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend promising untold riches and escape from the plague that ravaged her homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse –  but the lure of Eldoria, and the hope of a new life, spurred her onward through the treacherous landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula, the swirling colours of the Xylos system a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his starship's control panel. His mission: to retrieve the rare Xylos crystals vital for powering the galactic alliance's defense grid.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and pirate raids a constant threat.  But the galaxy’s fate, and the lives of billions, rested on his shoulders, making the perilous journey between planets and across the vast expanse of space a necessary, if daunting, task.
