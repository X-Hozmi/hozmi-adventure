
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary destrier onward.  The wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant cries of wolves.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each echoing hoofbeat, marked a step closer to either salvation or a grim end amongst the unforgiving wilderness. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the challenges that lay between him and his desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril, navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and constantly monitoring the ship's failing hyperdrive.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense distances separating humanity from its dreams of interstellar colonization.  Yet, the promise of discovery and the possibility of a new beginning fueled her unwavering resolve.
