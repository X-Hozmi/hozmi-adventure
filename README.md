
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plateau stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant Sultan.  Each day brought the risk of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of reaching her destination before winter's grip tightened. This journey, a pilgrimage of survival and hope, was an adventure forged in necessity, a testament to the human spirit's enduring strength.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the swirling nebulae outside their starship a kaleidoscope of impossible colours. Their mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the perils of unknown celestial phenomena and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  While the technology offered a degree of safety unavailable to Elara, the vastness of space, the constant threat of system failures, and the sheer isolation instilled a different kind of fear; the terrifying loneliness of insignificance against the backdrop of infinite stars.
