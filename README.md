
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating dense forests, fording icy streams, and bartering with suspicious villagers – yet the unwavering hope of discovery fuelled his tireless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Hyperspace jumps offered glimpses of breathtaking cosmic phenomena, but the vastness of space held its own dangers.  Rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the constant strain of interstellar travel tested the crew's resilience. Yet, the prospect of discovering new worlds, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, outweighed every risk.
