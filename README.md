
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant rain tease her onward, a promise of respite from the relentless journey.  Each crest of the rolling hills offers a new vista, a tapestry woven with the emerald threads of forests and the silver shimmer of rivers, yet also the stark reality of bandit-infested roads and unpredictable weather.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones by weary travelers.  The road is long, perilous, and uncertain, but the lure of the unknown drives her on.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace are commonplace hazards for Ryla and her crew.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light, a feat thought impossible by most.  The journey is fraught with danger – from hostile alien races to the ever-present threat of mechanical failure – but the possibility of rewriting the laws of physics fuels their relentless pursuit across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
