
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise reveals a new vista: towering castles silhouetted against the horizon, bustling market towns overflowing with exotic spices and unfamiliar faces, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  The journey is arduous, filled with the grueling rhythm of horse hooves and the constant vigilance against the elements and potential foes, but the promise of distant lands and untold riches fuels our weary steps. Every landmark holds the potential for both peril and profound discovery.


Millennia later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar exploration, cuts a path through the inky blackness, the faint nebulae painted across our viewport like cosmic brushstrokes.  Each jump takes us light-years away, to planets teeming with alien life, both wondrous and terrifying.  We navigate treacherous asteroid fields, grapple with temporal distortions, and face the ever-present threat of hostile alien civilizations, all in pursuit of knowledge and the expansion of humanity’s reach across the galaxy.  The universe is a vast, unpredictable ocean, but the thirst for the unknown is a powerful current, propelling us onward.
