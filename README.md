
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contained more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing fear of starvation, yet with every mile, Elara's resolve hardened.  The journey was perilous, but the promise of a new life fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown.  Whispers of sentient nebulae and space-faring predators haunted the crew, but Ryla's unwavering belief in her mission – and the advanced technology at her command – pushed her ever closer to the edge of the known universe, towards a destiny both glorious and terrifying.
