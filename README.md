
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she rides, the rhythmic clop of her horse's hooves a counterpoint to the creak of her saddle.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions, but the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels her onward, each sunrise a renewed testament to her unwavering courage.  She carries not only a worn map but the hopes of her desperate village resting on her slender shoulders.


Centuries later,  Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, "Stardust Drifter."  The vast expanse of the cosmos stretches before him, a breathtaking panorama of nebulas and distant galaxies.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of life-sustaining resources to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away.  Faster-than-light travel brings its own perils—spatial anomalies, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the inky black. Yet, the weight of responsibility, the hope of a distant colony, and the sheer wonder of interstellar travel propel him forward.
