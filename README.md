
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the roads treacherous, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death loomed larger than any mountain.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against starvation, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature and man.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f.   Navigation charts were unreliable in these uncharted regions of the galaxy, and the constant threat of pirate attacks and unforeseen spatial anomalies kept her crew on edge.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing humanity's boundaries, fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination, regardless of the cosmic hazards that lay ahead.
