
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend among his people, promising untold riches and a life beyond the poverty of his village.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the dense forest beside the path, held the promise of both adventure and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any imagined treasure.  He pressed on, driven by hope and a thirst for the unknown, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship and the seductive allure of discovery.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, both awed and humbled her.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant vigilance against unforeseen cosmic events were the daily challenges, far removed from the physical dangers of Thomas's medieval journey.  Yet, the spirit of adventure remained the same – a relentless pursuit of the unknown, a brave leap into the infinite possibilities of the cosmos, fueled by a human desire to explore.
