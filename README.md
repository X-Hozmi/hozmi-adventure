The journey to Avignon was perilous – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air.

The hum of the hyperdrive, the flashing constellations outside, were the soundtrack to his relentless pursuit of fortune and discovery amidst the breathtaking vastness of the cosmos.
