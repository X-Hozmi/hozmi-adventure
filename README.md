
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a King's writ, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged castle far to the east.  His journey was a tapestry woven with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes blanketed in snow, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience, his adventure a desperate race against time and the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the silent menace of unknown alien encounters.  But Eva, seasoned by countless voyages among the stars, pressed onward, her spirit as boundless as the cosmos itself, driven by hope and a fierce determination to complete her perilous, interstellar quest.
