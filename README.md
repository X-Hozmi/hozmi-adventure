
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, more faded than accurate, promises a hidden monastery holding the cure for her brother’s illness, a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brings new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating dense woodlands, and evading the suspicious gazes of villagers wary of outsiders.  Survival depends on her wit, her meager supplies, and the kindness of strangers – a gamble as potent as any adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in perpetual twilight.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate patrols, and repairing critical systems amidst the howling winds of hyperspace are all in a day's work for Eva and her ragtag crew.  The treasure they seek holds the key to interstellar peace, but the risks are immense;  a single wrong calculation could mean the difference between galactic glory and oblivion in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
