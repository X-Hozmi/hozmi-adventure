
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her mule plodded through the sun-baked landscape.  The scent of pine and woodsmoke clung to her, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the distant sea, her destination.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes rumored to be haunted by brigands, and beyond those, the whispered promise of a legendary city said to hold forgotten magic. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers and the potential rewards of her journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aerthos.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, was risky; hyperspace currents were unpredictable and fraught with danger.  But the chance to colonize a new world, to plant the flag of humanity amongst the stars, fueled her intrepid spirit.  The vastness of space, the cold indifference of the cosmos, held a different kind of peril, but the allure of discovery, of charting a course through the unmapped expanse of the galaxy, made the risk worthwhile.
