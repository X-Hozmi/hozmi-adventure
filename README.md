
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promises a hidden monastery beyond, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking step of the journey is a gamble; bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, and the unforgiving terrain threatens to swallow them whole.  Yet, the desperate hope for healing fuels her onward, each hardship a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey is fraught with perils—uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But the allure of discovering a new world, of planting humanity's flag on alien soil, outweighs the risks.  The vast expanse of space is a daunting frontier, but for Eva, it's a canvas painted with the vibrant colors of possibility and the thrill of the unknown.
