
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with rain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the allure of the distant shrine fueled her onward. This was more than travel; it was a test of faith, resilience, and the human spirit's boundless capacity for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', the hyperdrive spitting them into the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His crew, a motley bunch of explorers and bounty hunters, held their breath, the ship groaning under the strain of faster-than-light travel. Their mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda galaxy, a gamble fueled by the promise of untold riches and the insatiable human hunger for discovery.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes they might encounter, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroid fields and hostile alien civilizations, all paled in comparison to the exhilarating rush of pushing the boundaries of the known universe.
