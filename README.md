
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bit at Elara's face as she urged her weary horse onward, the rough track barely discernible beneath the autumn leaves.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just a few of the perils she faced on her arduous journey across the sprawling kingdom of Aeridor, each sunrise a gamble against the unpredictable landscape and the even more unpredictable intentions of others.  Her quest was perilous, but the promise of glory fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and combating the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day's work for Rexx.  The universe was a vast and unforgiving expanse, yet the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, propelled him ever forward through the inky black.
