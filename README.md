The journey had been long and arduous, filled with perilous encounters with bandits and wild beasts.

They carried with them scientific instruments, hopes for discovery, and the unspoken knowledge that this mission could rewrite humanity's understanding of the universe. Each alien species encountered, each new phenomenon observed, was a step further into the unknown.
