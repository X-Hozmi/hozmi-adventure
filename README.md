
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers encountered along the way, and the sheer beauty of the vast, unpredictable landscape fueled her onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The cosmos stretched before him, an infinite tapestry of swirling colors and distant suns.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  But the vastness of space, the thrill of discovery, and the potential for uncovering new life and civilizations far surpassed the risks, propelling him and his crew ever further into the breathtaking, and terrifying, unknown.
