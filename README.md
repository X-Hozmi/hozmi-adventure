
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air. Each crest scaled, each river forded, was a victory against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of starvation or worse.  The promise of riches and a new life fueled her weary steps, a beacon in the vast, uncertain wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faintest whispers of a long-lost civilization.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was a calculated risk, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets tested both her skill and the ship's resilience.  The potential discovery of an ancient, technologically superior race, however, far outweighed the dangers of this interstellar voyage.
