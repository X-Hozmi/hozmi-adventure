
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my weary horse onward, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a destination whispered about in hushed tones in smoky taverns.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the potential for glory and discovery, spurred me onwards. The map, a faded parchment clutched tight in my hand, was my only guide through this perilous landscape.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the infinite blackness.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, prepared for planetary descent, their faces illuminated by the flickering console lights.  The vastness of space, the inherent dangers of wormhole transit, and the unknown nature of the alien world were far removed from the medieval risks, yet the thrill of exploration, the insatiable human curiosity to uncover the secrets of the universe, burned just as brightly within us.
