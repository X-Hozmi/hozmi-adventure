
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the weather was unpredictable, and disease stalked the land. Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheels and each sunrise painting the sky in hues of hope, Elara pressed onward, driven by faith and a thirst for the unknown that lay beyond the next hill. The whispered tales of the distant city fueled her spirit, promising solace and a chance to escape the stifling confines of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her starship. Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and countless uncharted planets.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for discovery—or annihilation.  The vastness of the cosmos held both wonder and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, faced the challenges with steely resolve, her spirit mirroring the endless expanse of stars above.
