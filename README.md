
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of men trudged onward, their cloaks flapping like raven's wings. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a healing balm capable of saving Gareth's ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their determination hardened by the harsh realities of their journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, searching for a lost colony ship.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all part of the routine. But this journey held a deeper significance;  the colony ship carried the last known samples of the rare Xylossian flower, essential for curing a devastating galactic plague.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion on her interstellar odyssey.
