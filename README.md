Dust swirled behind them, a testament to their arduous journey across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunset brought the chilling uncertainty of finding safe haven, their path fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Yet, the glint of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered of in taverns and sung by bards, fueled their relentless advance, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.  This was not mere travel; it was a desperate gambit, a gamble with life itself.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers hailing from a dozen worlds, scanned the cosmos for signs of the mythical Kryll homeworld, a planet said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.   The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, the ship a fragile vessel against the immense, indifferent vastness of space.  Each jump through hyperspace held a risk, a gamble with the fabric of reality itself, but the allure of unlocking the universe's secrets was a prize worth any peril.
