
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to find her lost brother, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each hardship overcome, a sense of fierce determination hardened her spirit, fueled by the hope of reunion.  The road ahead was long, but the whispers of adventure kept her moving forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter,' the vibrant nebula of the Cygnus X-1 system swirling outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and countless uncharted worlds.  The thrill of discovery, of facing the unknown – the possibility of encountering new life forms, or navigating treacherous asteroid fields – was a constant hum beneath the ship's steady thrum.  The vastness of space held both immense beauty and terrifying danger, but for Eva, the allure of the cosmos was an irresistible siren's call.
