
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath of her horse, mirrored the anxieties churning within her.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Sernin, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey, testing her courage and resourcefulness at every turn.  Yet, the whisper of hope, as faint as a distant church bell, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy by a rogue gravitational wave.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of space.  The weight of responsibility for her crew, coupled with the vast, uncaring immensity of the cosmos, pressed upon her, but the burning desire to find survivors fueled her unwavering determination.
