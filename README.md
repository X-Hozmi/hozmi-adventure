The muddy track snaked through a primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost scriptures of the ancients.

Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.
