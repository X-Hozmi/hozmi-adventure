
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Bandits were a constant threat, the whispered rumours of a mythical city of gold a siren song pulling her ever onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of anticipation down her spine.  The journey was arduous, days bleeding into weeks, marked by the sting of sunburn, the gnawing pangs of hunger, and the breathtaking beauty of a landscape both unforgiving and magnificent.  She carried more than just supplies; she carried hope, fueled by legends and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of intergalactic travel permits, but the thrill of exploring a newly charted galaxy far outweighed the frustrations.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  With a crew of seasoned explorers and a ship brimming with advanced technology, Ryla faced the vast emptiness of space not with fear, but with the exhilarating promise of discovery, a legacy to leave among the stars.
