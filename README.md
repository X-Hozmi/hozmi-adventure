
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the weather unforgiving, and the very landscape itself a challenge; treacherous mountain passes and swollen rivers tested their resilience at every turn.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the hope of reaching their sacred destination, a hope that fueled their weary steps across the vast, untamed expanse of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms was commonplace; the vast emptiness between planets and galaxies held its own terrors, from rogue black holes to unknown alien entities.  Yet, the lure of discovery and the potential to reshape the future of interstellar travel propelled Eva forward, a lone voyager pushing the boundaries of human exploration amidst the breathtaking, and terrifying, immensity of space.
