
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained a king's ransom in stolen maps, promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each sun-baked valley and windswept mountain pass was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter.  The whispered legends of mythical creatures guarding the monastery's secrets only fueled her desperate journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potentially hostile alien flora and fauna.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to survive. The galaxy held infinite wonders, but it also offered an equal measure of peril; this journey tested the limits of human ingenuity and courage in the vast unknown.
