His journey across the rugged, untamed lands of Aerthos was far from comfortable, each day a battle against mud, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold unimaginable power, spurred him onward, pushing him through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked plains.

The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of vibrant colors and cosmic wonders, held a different kind of hardship than Kaelan's, a test of technological prowess and unwavering determination in the face of the infinite.
