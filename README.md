
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, had already claimed several men to exhaustion and disease.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandit raids, while the nights held the chilling whispers of mythical beasts said to haunt these desolate lands.  Their weathered maps offered little solace, often leading them astray through treacherous bogs and dense, wolf-infested forests. Survival demanded unwavering courage, fierce loyalty, and a constant reliance on the grace of whatever gods might hear their desperate prayers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The journey spanned lightyears, traversing treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, were commonplace, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure loomed large.  The vastness of space amplified the isolation, but Eva's unwavering determination, fuelled by a desperate hope for survival and the promise of discovery, pushed her and her crew ever forward, towards the unknown.
