
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the unforgiving Breton countryside was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every league covered, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward – the promise of reaching the legendary city of Ys, whispered to be guarded by magic and brimming with untold riches, kept her spirit alight despite the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with celestial wonders and lurking dangers, held a different kind of hardship.  Asteroid fields threatened to pulverize her vessel, rogue gravitational pulls could send her spiralling into oblivion, and the alien landscapes of distant planets offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  But the allure of discovering new worlds, charting unmapped galaxies, and encountering civilizations beyond human comprehension spurred her on, a modern-day explorer in a universe teeming with endless possibilities.
