
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear; rumors of bandits infested the Black Forest ahead.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the Duke, felt less heroic and more perilous with each creaking step of his weary mount.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a jolt through him, a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel, where danger lurked around every bend in the road and the journey itself was as much an adventure as the destination.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy shimmering outside her viewport.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos cluster, rumored to contain a source of limitless energy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate was all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, offered a different kind of challenge than Thomas's forest path, but the thrill of discovery, the unknown waiting just beyond the next jump point, fueled her journey just as surely as hope had fueled Thomas's.
