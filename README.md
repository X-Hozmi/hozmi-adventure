
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – rare spices sought by the King, a quest that led her through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes. Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, the chilling reality of starvation, but the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward. The whispered legends of the East, of silks and jeweled cities, spurred her tired feet, a potent elixir against the hardships of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula itself. Yet, the vast expanse of space, the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, and the promise of uncovering a new energy source propelled her forward, a modern-day adventurer charting uncharted territories amongst the stars.
