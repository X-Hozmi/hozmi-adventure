
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, a young cartographer fleeing a vengeful baron, urges his weary horse onward. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Days bleed into weeks, each sunrise bringing the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  He navigates treacherous mountain passes, fords raging rivers, and endures the scorn of suspicious villagers, his only companion a worn map and the unwavering hope of finding sanctuary and fortune.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through a nebula of shimmering turquoise gas.  Her mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of bio-engineered crops to the newly colonized planet Xylos, a world teeming with both opportunity and danger.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and managing the complex life support systems of her vessel test her skills and courage to their limits. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, holds the promise of untold discoveries – and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
