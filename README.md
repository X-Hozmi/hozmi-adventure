
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, a far cry from the rolling hills of my English home.  Ahead lay the treacherous Bohemian Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts. My quest: to deliver a sacred relic to a monastery nestled deep within the Alps.  Each sunrise brought the chilling uncertainty of the unknown – a chance encounter with a wandering monk, a desperate flight from a sudden storm, the gnawing hunger in my belly. Every mile was a gamble, a test of endurance against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the silence of interstellar space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The thrill of discovery battled with the ever-present risk; a rogue asteroid, a malfunctioning warp core, the chilling isolation of deep space.  The vastness here was different, cold and unforgiving, yet strangely beautiful. Each jump across the cosmic ocean was a leap of faith, a gamble with the laws of physics and the capricious nature of the universe.
