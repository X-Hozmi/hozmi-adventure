
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys before the encroaching winter sealed the mountain passes.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches spurred him on, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey itself, fraught with peril and hardship, was as much an adventure as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable pockets of temporal distortion within the nebula itself.  Each jump to hyperspace held the potential for disaster, but the promise of galactic-spanning discovery fueled her courage, pushing her and her crew to the very edge of known space and into the unknown depths of the cosmos.
