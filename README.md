Rumors of a hidden city, a forgotten haven of knowledge and magic, spurred him onward. Each day brought new challenges – perilous forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits. He had to be swift, cunning, and strong, his every move guided by a burning desire for adventure and the promise of untold riches.

Each jump through the wormhole brought them closer to their destination, a planet shrouded in enigma. But the journey held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the constant threat of the unknown. The allure of discovery, however, fuelled their unwavering determination to reach their goal.
