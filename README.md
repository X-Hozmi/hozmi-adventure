
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  My quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and claim the lost scroll of Alatar, drove me onward, the image of its shimmering towers a beacon in the harsh reality of the medieval world.  Every day was a gamble against the elements, against rival adventurers, and against my own dwindling strength.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we jumped between star systems.  My destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in myth and rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, peppered with the glittering dust of nebulae, held a different kind of terror – the silent threat of cosmic radiation, malfunctioning equipment, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  But the allure of unlocking the galaxy's secrets, of charting unknown territories, far outweighed the risks, making each hyperspace jump a leap of faith into the brilliant, dangerous unknown.
