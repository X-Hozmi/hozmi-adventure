
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, guided her toward the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets older than time itself.  Bandits, scorching heat, and treacherous terrain tested her resilience, each sunrise a gamble against exhaustion and the unknown. Yet, the thrill of the journey, the possibility of uncovering lost wonders, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids was commonplace; the vastness of space held its own perils, far more alien than any medieval bandit. But the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets, of charting a course for humanity amongst the stars, made the risks worthwhile, igniting a fire in her soul that burned brighter than any sun.
