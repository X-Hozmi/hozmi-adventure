
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary in Spain.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother spurred her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the crimson glow illuminating the sleek lines of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Ahead lay the perilous jump through the unstable wormhole, a gamble that could either bring untold riches and knowledge, or leave his crew stranded in the unforgiving void.  The vastness of space, a canvas splattered with stars and nebulae, held both terrifying beauty and the irresistible promise of discovery, driving Jax and his crew forward into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
