
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the tattered map guiding her to Avignon.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey, but the promise of a new life, whispered by the wind rustling through the wheat fields, fueled her weary steps. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but also the thrilling possibility of discovery around the next bend in the road.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the vast gulf between galaxies was a delicate dance of gravitational pulls and hyperspace jumps, each a gamble with the fabric of spacetime itself.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known universe, faced the constant threat of pirate attacks and unpredictable stellar phenomena.  Yet, the allure of uncharted worlds, teeming with unknown life and resources, spurred them onward, their collective hope a bright star against the cosmic dark.
