
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of brooding forests and treacherous mountains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – marauding bandits, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by whispered legends and the desperate pleas of his people, spurred him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with danger, navigating asteroid fields, grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks. But the vast, glittering expanse of space, a canvas of unimaginable wonders, fueled her adventurous spirit and the vital mission that pushed her across the uncharted cosmic seas.
