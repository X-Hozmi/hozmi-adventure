
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains, the midday sun a relentless tormentor. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred him onward, the rhythmic clip-clop of his horse's hooves a counterpoint to the hammering of his own hopeful heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson and gold gases a breathtaking spectacle. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess a unique energy source capable of solving the galactic energy crisis.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading hostile pirate fleets, she relied on her wits and cutting-edge technology, the vast, indifferent cosmos a constant reminder of both the awe-inspiring beauty and deadly dangers of interstellar travel.
