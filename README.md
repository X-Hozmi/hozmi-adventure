
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing the rumored location of the Sunstone, a relic said to hold unimaginable power.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, brought a frisson of fear and excitement. Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey across the kingdom, a quest fueled by a desperate hope and unwavering courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a breathtaking distraction from the daunting task ahead.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by the anomaly three years prior.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the silent pressure of potential failure were a different kind of challenge, but just as terrifying as any medieval bandit.  Each jump through hyperspace, each scan of a new planet, held the promise of both discovery and annihilation.
