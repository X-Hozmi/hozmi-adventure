
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat; bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself tested her resilience at every turn.  Yet, the hope for her people spurred her onward, transforming the grueling journey into a desperate, thrilling race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  The journey to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap, was fraught with peril: asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Rexx, fuelled by ambition and a thirst for the unknown, pressed on, his crew a band of hardened spacefarers united by a shared dream of charting the uncharted.  The vastness of space, though terrifying, paled in comparison to the excitement of discovering what lay beyond.
