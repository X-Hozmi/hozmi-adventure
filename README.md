
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains crimson.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and the map – a faded testament to her quest for the legendary Sunstone.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the whispered legends of the Sunstone's power fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each sunset a reminder of the perilous journey ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders demanded nerves of steel and reflexes honed by years in the black. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, held both immense danger and the thrill of discovery, pushing Rexx and his crew to the edge of their capabilities in their desperate quest for a new beginning.
