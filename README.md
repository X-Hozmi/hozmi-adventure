
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey.  Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset a precarious victory against the elements and the unknown.  The weight of his hopes, and the fear of failure, spurred him across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly across the void.  Warp drives hummed, battling gravitational distortions and the chilling emptiness of interstellar space.  Asteroid fields were navigated with hair-raising precision, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the boundless, beautiful, and terrifying cosmos.
