
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had been fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested her resilience.  Yet, the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets propelled her forward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien lifeforms.  Unlike the medieval adventurers before her, Ryla relied on advanced technology, but the spirit of exploration remained the same – a relentless pursuit of the unknown, fueled by a thirst for discovery and the boundless human desire to push the frontiers of what is possible.
