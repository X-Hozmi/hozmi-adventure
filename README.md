
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, more frayed than reliable, offered little comfort against the looming shadow of the craggy peaks.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend promising untold riches and a chance to escape the tyranny of her homeland.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of the precarious balance of life on the medieval road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of countless stars, held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers. The journey, far removed from the medieval treks of old, carried a similar weight of hope and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
