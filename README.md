
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but also the thrill of discovery; the bustling market towns, the whispered legends of mythical creatures, and the breathtaking beauty of untamed nature fueled her onward.  This pilgrimage was not merely a physical one, but a journey of the soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and unimaginable distances.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. Yet, the vastness of space held a similar allure to Elara's medieval journey; the discovery of new planets, the wonder of celestial phenomena, and the constant push against the boundaries of human knowledge propelled her across the cosmos.
