
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Gareth's saddle as he guides his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represents, fuels his weary body and determined spirit, pushing him ever onward towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems.  Warp drives hum, battling the gravitational pull of black holes and navigating asteroid fields.  Alien landscapes flash past her viewport – vibrant, hostile, and breathtakingly beautiful – each a testament to the vastness of space and the boundless possibilities, and dangers, of interstellar travel.
