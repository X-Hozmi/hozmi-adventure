
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies – it contained a king's ransom in silks and spices, a perilous cargo purchased in the bustling markets of Constantinople.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine – the whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of the desert itself made this journey a constant test of courage and resilience.  Reaching Damascus felt as distant and improbable as a fairytale.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship shuddered under the strain of hyperspace.  The galaxy map shimmered on her console, a tapestry of distant suns and unexplored worlds.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict mining station orbiting Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were not bandits or harsh terrain, but cosmic radiation, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from any help.  The stakes were far higher than silks and spices; this journey determined the future of humanity itself.
