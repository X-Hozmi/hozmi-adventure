
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d left the familiar comfort of his village weeks ago, a satchel slung over his shoulder containing little more than dried meat and a worn map promising riches in the fabled city of Zerzura. Each creaking wagon wheel, each howling wolf in the distance, each ford across a raging river was a test of his courage and endurance. The vast, unpredictable landscape stretched before him, a tapestry woven with danger and the intoxicating lure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the inky blackness of the void.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, rumoured to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, dodging the predatory grasp of space pirates, her journey was a dance between meticulous planning and the chaotic unpredictability of deep space. The vastness, instead of a daunting landscape, was a limitless ocean of possibilities, each star a potential destination in a universe brimming with untold wonders and unseen perils.
