
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions, alongside a map detailing the treacherous path to the fabled city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened her senses, fueling her determination to reach her destination, a quest as ancient as the mountains themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship as they jumped between galaxies, charting unmapped territories.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, scanned the cosmos for habitable planets, facing down cosmic storms and navigating asteroid fields in their pursuit of knowledge and the promise of new worlds. The vastness of space presented a different kind of danger than the medieval wilds, a cosmic unknown stretching far beyond anything Elara could ever have imagined.
