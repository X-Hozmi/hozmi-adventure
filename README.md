
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  His meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of Zerzura, propelled him forward, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was child's play compared to the existential dread of traversing the uncharted expanse of space.  The vast emptiness, broken only by the cold glitter of distant stars, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the unimaginable distances that separated her from home – a home she might never see again.
