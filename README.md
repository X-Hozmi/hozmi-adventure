
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his mount onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both man and beast tumbling to their doom, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked him with each passing day. Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, spurred him onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain wilderness.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, dodging rogue asteroids and the occasional hostile K'tharr raider, was a daily ordeal. The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas of shimmering nebulas and distant galaxies, both thrilled and terrified her.  The fate of countless souls rested on her shoulders, a weight as heavy as the ship itself, as she pressed ever onward into the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
