
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispers of Ys, a shimmering jewel hidden amidst storm-tossed cliffs, fueled his determination, pushing him ever closer to his perilous destination.  He knew the journey would test his strength, his courage, and ultimately, his very soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian warships, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's aging technology.  The vastness of space presented a different kind of peril; isolation and the constant threat of unknown cosmic phenomena challenged them as much as any enemy. Yet, the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting a new era for humanity, spurred them onward through the uncharted darkness.
