
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of both peril and discovery. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fueled by whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic. The path was arduous, a tapestry woven with the sweat of her brow and the unwavering strength of her spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble on uncharted coordinates promised by a cryptic message from a long-lost civilization.  The weight of her crew's lives and the potential for groundbreaking discovery pressed heavily on her shoulders as she wrestled with fluctuating gravitational forces and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  The vast, unknowable cosmos held both breathtaking wonder and terrifying unknowns.
