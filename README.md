
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, spurred his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to harbor both brigands and mythical beasts.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Bavaria, a journey fraught with peril across unforgiving terrain, treacherous rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient ruins. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of this perilous land-based adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a crucial data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a perilous undertaking across uncharted star systems and through asteroid fields teeming with unknown dangers.  The hum of the ship's engines, the vast emptiness of space, and the constant threat of navigational errors added to the thrill of this interstellar voyage.  Each jump through hyperspace brought them closer to the unknown.
