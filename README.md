
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees as Elara, her worn leather satchel bouncing against her hip, spurred her mule onward.  She'd traded her family's meager harvest for a place on a merchant caravan bound for the fabled city of Damascus, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  But the allure of the East, the whispered tales of spices and silks, spurred her onward through the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in the sleek, silver hull of the *Stardust*.  Ahead, the crimson giant of Kepler-186f pulsed, a beacon promising untold riches and scientific discovery.  Unlike Elara's perilous land journey, Jax faced the cosmic dangers of asteroid fields, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on intergalactic trade routes.  Yet, the vastness of space, the opportunity to explore uncharted territories, and the potential for groundbreaking knowledge fueled his relentless drive across the galaxy.
