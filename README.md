
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the unwavering belief in her mission propelled her onward, every sunrise a promise of closer proximity to salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Nova' soared through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve a rare element from the ice planet of Kryos, crucial to powering the intergalactic network.  The journey was fraught with dangers – asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions – but Rexx, hardened by years spent traversing the void, faced them all with cool determination, fueled by the promise of a hefty reward and the thrill of the unknown.
