
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword heavy with the weight of travel, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty.  He’d crossed treacherous mountain passes where eagles circled overhead, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and slept under skies ablaze with a million stars, far from the comforts of castle walls. Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the scorching heat of sun-baked plains, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the call of the crusade, pushed him forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a different kind of arduous, a relentless battle against the void itself.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, repairs to the ship's aging hyperdrive, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested her crew's resilience.  Unlike Reginald's journey across familiar lands, Eva's was into uncharted territories, filled with alien landscapes and unimaginable wonders, where the rewards of discovery far outweighed the perilous nature of interstellar travel.
