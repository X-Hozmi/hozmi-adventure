
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each creak of the pack animal is a testament to the miles already conquered, a rhythm accompanying the relentless march towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are but minor inconveniences in her quest; the lure of untold riches and exotic spices far outweighs the perils of this arduous journey across the known world.  Every sunrise brings a new challenge, a new vista, a new opportunity to etch her name into the annals of daring explorers.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Kestrel pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  His destination: the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is a constant companion, a symphony of controlled warp energy pushing him towards the unknown.  He navigates treacherous asteroid fields, avoids the gravitational clutches of rogue planets, and outmaneuvers the occasional pirate vessel. His mission, though, is far from plunder;  Comet seeks a new home for humanity, a habitable planet far beyond the dying embers of Earth. The cosmos holds infinite possibilities, but also infinite dangers.
