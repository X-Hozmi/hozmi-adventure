
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, a young cartographer fleeing a vengeful Baron, urged his weary horse onward.  His satchel, containing maps painstakingly drawn over years, bounced against his ribs.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every league conquered, the thrill of discovery fuelled his journey, a stark contrast to the stifling confinement of his previous life. He yearned to reach the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis hidden deep within the unforgiving desert.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship 'Stardust' across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, swallowed by the anomaly known as the Whisperwind Nebula.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable gravitational fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant hum of the ship's engines, a relentless reminder of her isolation.  But the vastness of space held an allure, a hypnotic beauty that mirrored the intrepid spirit of explorers past. The fate of the colonists rested on her shoulders, a burden balanced by the exhilarating possibility of charting unmapped territories among the stars.
