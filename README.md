
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, wound ever deeper into the unknown.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and wonder, from brigands lurking in the shadows to the breathtaking vistas that occasionally rewarded his arduous journey.  His trusty sword was his only companion in this treacherous gamble with fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a tapestry woven from hyper-jumps and careful navigation through asteroid fields, was fraught with the silent dangers of space - radiation storms, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life.  But the promise of discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories in the vast cosmic ocean, fuelled her relentless pursuit of the unknown.
