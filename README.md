Her mule, laden with meager supplies and a battered map, struggles with each rocky incline.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her quest to reach the rumored city of gold, a journey fueled by whispered legends and a desperate hope for a better life.  Every creak of the saddle, every distant howl, fuels the adrenaline of her perilous adventure, a testament to human resilience against the harsh realities of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Meridian pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, holds both immense promise and mortal danger.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure are commonplace occurrences on this interstellar voyage, a testament to humanity's relentless push to explore the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
