
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map promising riches – or ruin – in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease that stalked the medieval traveler.  Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled her forward, a thirst for adventure stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation systems.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held its own perils: asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, perhaps hostile, alien civilizations.  But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories in the cosmos, ignited a fire in her soul, a legacy to leave for future generations of starfarers.
