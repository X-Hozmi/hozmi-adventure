His journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring thaw.

Her mission: to locate the fabled 'Celestial Well', a legendary source of energy capable of powering the dying galactic core and saving countless civilizations. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the immense scale of her undertaking and the tenuous grip humanity held on survival.
