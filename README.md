
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – the whispered tales of bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the promise of vibrant bazaars in distant cities, and the ever-present danger of disease and starvation.  The rough-hewn tracks, barely discernible underfoot, wind through treacherous mountain passes and across vast, unforgiving deserts, a journey as much a test of endurance as it is a quest for fortune and discovery.  The stars at night are our only constant companions, guiding us through the darkness to the next uncertain dawn.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Wanderer* cuts a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Captain Eva Rostova guides her crew across interstellar distances, navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms with a blend of advanced technology and daring ingenuity. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.  The thrill isn't just in the potential discovery of new worlds and civilizations, but in the very act of traversing the immense gulf of space, pushing the boundaries of human exploration to realms once considered the stuff of myth.
