
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than herself, its creases mirroring the lines etched onto her face.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter.  But the whispered legends of the lost city of Ys, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and arcane knowledge, spurred her onward, a flickering ember against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigation charts shimmered on her console, mapping a course through nebulae and past dying stars.  Her crew, a diverse band united by a thirst for discovery, prepped for the arrival at Xylos, a planet rumored to house the remnants of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization.  The journey was fraught with dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of pirates – but the allure of Xylos's secrets, whispered on the galactic wind, was a siren's call they couldn't resist.
