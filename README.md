Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had tested them both.  Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road – all were but stepping stones on their arduous path.

The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, the navigation complex beyond measure, but the potential reward – a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – was too tantalizing to resist.  The hum of the hyperdrive, a constant companion, underscored the vastness of space, a lonely counterpoint to the camaraderie within her small, intrepid crew.
