
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and meager coins; it contained a map promising the lost city of Zerzura, a legendary oasis whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill and terror of the unknown, a constant companion on her perilous journey across the unforgiving heartland.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and illusion, the cosmos a breathtaking tapestry of colours and celestial wonders.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival. The vast expanse of space held both immense beauty and unimaginable danger; asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien species, all formed part of the breathtaking, and deadly, adventure that lay ahead.
