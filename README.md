
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each wary glance from a passing knight was a potential obstacle on her arduous journey, a testament to the dangers and uncertainties inherent in medieval travel.  She carried with her not only meager supplies but also the unwavering hope that fueled her across treacherous mountains and bustling market towns.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and uncharted wormholes.  Advanced technology aided her, but the vastness of space, the loneliness of interstellar travel, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters tested her courage and skill far beyond the challenges faced by any medieval traveler.  The cosmos, while magnificent, was a far more unforgiving frontier.
