
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that danced in the fading light. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it offered, spurred them on through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth. The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Warp jumps brought moments of disorientation and peril, while the constant hum of the ship's engines and the cold emptiness outside served as a stark reminder of the loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for finding a new home for humanity, fueled her relentless journey across the cosmos.
