
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's hopes, a desperate journey to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every arduous mile, a sense of grim determination fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching at the sight of a thousand shimmering suns.  This was not a desperate flight for survival, but a mission of scientific discovery across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the quiet hum of anticipation for the uncharted planets awaiting them – planets promising wonders beyond human comprehension, but also potential dangers equally as vast. The journey was not measured in miles, but in light-years, and the challenges were not bandits and starvation, but cosmic storms and the unknown.
