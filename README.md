
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a patchwork of humans and beasts, trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of either bounty or peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked us like a phantom.  Yet, the lure of the distant spice markets of the East, the chance to witness legendary cities and amass untold riches, fueled our onward journey despite the constant gnawing fear and exhaustion.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The sleek crimson hull of the *Stardust Drifter* cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy, its hyperdrive a hum against the vast silence.  We were pioneers, charting unknown nebulae and seeking out habitable planets amidst the swirling cosmic dust.  The risks were different—alien infestations, unpredictable wormholes, the sheer loneliness of interstellar space—but the thrill of discovery, the boundless potential of the universe, remained the irresistible siren song pulling us ever further from the cradle of Earth.
