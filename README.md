
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, the promise of distant cathedrals and the camaraderie of fellow travelers pushing him further across the rugged landscape.  The road was long, but the tales to be told at its end would be worth the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't about physical hardship; it was a relentless battle against the vastness of space.  Warp drives hummed, navigational systems glitched, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and unforeseen cosmic events kept her crew on edge.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding life beyond Earth, fueled their tireless voyage through the inky black, a testament to humanity's enduring thirst for the unknown.
