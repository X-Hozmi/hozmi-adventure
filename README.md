Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and whispers of mythical beasts echoed in the wind.

His quest, to find the lost city of Eldoria, fueled his weary bones and spurred him towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps always held a thrill.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, was a constant reminder of the sheer scale of her adventure, and the untold wonders – and dangers – it promised.
