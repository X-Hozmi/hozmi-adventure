
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a few precious coins, and the map – a crude, almost illegible thing – that guided her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown, each sunset a testament to her resilience.  The allure of the legend, however, fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be teeming with hostile lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, yet the dangers remained:  uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders stalking the intergalactic trade routes.  But Ryla, fueled by the weight of her responsibility and the thrill of exploration, steered her ship ever onward, a lone voyager charting a course through the unfathomable expanse of space.
