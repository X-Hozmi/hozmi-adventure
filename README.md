
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  Ahead, the Pyrenees loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored healing spring in Compostela.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death still haunted the land.  Her meager possessions, a few coins and a chipped wooden carving of the Virgin Mary, were all that stood between her and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Starseeker*, a nebula of crimson and gold swirling outside the viewport.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, and the void between galaxies held unseen dangers, from rogue asteroids to sentient energy storms.  But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fragmented people, fueled Ryla’s courage, propelling her across the unimaginable distances of space.
