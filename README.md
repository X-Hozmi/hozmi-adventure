
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the pack animal behind him, a tempting prize for the bandits that haunted these desolate lands. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him. His journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril, a constant test of endurance against unforgiving terrain and ruthless human foes.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new gamble with fate.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially dangerous life.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable warp currents that could tear a ship apart in an instant.  The vastness of space offered a stunning, terrifying beauty, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of the ship's bridge, where every decision held the weight of the galaxy on her shoulders.
