
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her loyal destrier, a sturdy grey mare named Lyra, matching her weary pace.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was proving more perilous than any tale foretold. Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resilience.  Yet, the glint of gold rumored to lie within Zerzura's walls, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, a testament to the enduring human spirit's quest for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat deemed impossible by most.  Each jump through the warp gate was a gamble, a breathtaking leap of faith into the uncharted cosmos.  The vibrant colors of unknown planets, the silent majesty of black holes, and the constant threat of rogue asteroid fields – these were the hazards of her trade, far removed from medieval perils, yet equally thrilling in their scale and unpredictability.  The universe, her playground, beckoned with limitless possibilities.
