
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the stench of fear that clung to him. He carried a king's ransom – and a king's curse –  a heavy chest bound for a distant monastery, its contents a secret known only to him and his late master.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, spurred his frantic pace; bandits, rival lords, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death were all threats on this perilous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe.

Centuries later, Elara gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter,' the hyperspace jump almost complete.  Ahead lay Xylos, a jewel-toned planet shrouded in swirling nebulae, her destination after a year traversing the Orion Arm.  The thrill of discovery was tempered by the ever-present danger of pirate raiders and unstable wormholes.  The cargo hold pulsed with the strange, bioluminescent flora she'd collected from three other systems, her quest a scientific gamble with potentially world-altering results.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space offered both limitless wonder and terrifying isolation.
