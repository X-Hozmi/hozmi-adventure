
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdom.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, testing his courage and resilience as he navigated the unpredictable landscape and the even more unpredictable whims of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson light of its dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling unpredictable warp storms were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew. The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable peril, demanding a skill and daring that matched the legendary medieval journeys of old, but with the added challenge of navigating the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
