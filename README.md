
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing a route across the treacherous Black Forest to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, yet the lure of Eldoria's legendary riches – and perhaps even a cure for his ailing sister – spurred him relentlessly forward, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of hope and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its engines humming a low thrum as it jumped through hyperspace.  Her mission: to locate a newly discovered habitable planet orbiting Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks. Yet, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, of establishing a colony on fertile alien soil, fueled her resolve, each hyperspace jump a leap of faith into the vast unknown.
