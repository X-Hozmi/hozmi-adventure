
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held the last of her family's meager possessions, a small, worn map promising salvation in a distant monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, threatened to unravel her fragile hope; bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions on this perilous journey across the continent, a quest born of desperation and fueled by unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of dying stars and the occasional, ominous asteroid field, held a different kind of danger – the unknown, the uncharted, and the potential for catastrophic engine failure light-years from any known civilization.  His journey was one of scientific pursuit, fueled by ambition and the intoxicating lure of the cosmos.
