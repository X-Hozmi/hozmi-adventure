
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her pack mule, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  The thrill of the unknown, the relentless pursuit of a whispered legend, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a breathtaking contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with unknown dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, the unimaginable distances, and the tantalizing promise of discovery pushed her to the edge of her capabilities, a modern-day explorer charting the cosmos.
