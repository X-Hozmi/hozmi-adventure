
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track wound through a forest thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, each bend promising either bandit ambush or the next leg of his arduous journey to the Holy Land.  He carried with him not just a sword and shield, but also a king’s desperate plea for aid against a burgeoning rebellion, a plea delivered through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving plains, his only companions the ever-present shadow of fear and the unwavering hope of his mission's success.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey was not for piety, but for the discovery of new resources vital to humanity’s survival.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes that spat them across unimaginable distances, she and her crew faced cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of pirates roaming the black.  The glittering tapestry of the cosmos was both breathtaking and terrifying, a testament to the boundless wonder and danger of interstellar travel.
