
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog was a potential threat, bandits and wild beasts lurking in the shadows of the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was a gamble, a desperate chase against time and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, was fraught with peril; unpredictable gravitational currents and rogue asteroids threatened to tear her vessel apart. Yet, the promise of new life, new beginnings, spurred her onward, the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos both inspiring and terrifying in its limitless expanse.
