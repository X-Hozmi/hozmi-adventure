
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  horseshoes ringing on cobblestones,  finally reached the outskirts of Prague.  Weeks of relentless travel across the treacherous Bavarian forests and the unforgiving Bohemian plains had taken their toll.  Each mud-caked boot carried stories of skirmishes with bandits, near-starvation in desolate villages, and the constant threat of disease.  But the promise of the renowned Prague clockmaker, rumored to possess a revolutionary astrolabe, spurred them onward, a beacon in the face of fatigue and hardship.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the ancient whispers of long-dead navigators.  Each jump between galaxies brought the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of encountering alien life, both benevolent and hostile.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reminder of the vastness of space and the fragility of their ship as they sought the legendary lost city of Aethel, a myth whispered across the cosmos.
