
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous bogs swallowing entire horses whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred him and his small band onwards, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown dangers that lay ahead.  Their only companions were the rustling leaves, the chirping of unseen creatures, and the gnawing hunger in their bellies.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less fraught with peril.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, the constant threat of pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present risk of engine failure kept her crew on edge.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to forge a future for humanity among the stars, fueled her determination to reach their destination, charting a course through the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
