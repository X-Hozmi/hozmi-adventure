
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary oxen onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, had already tested her spirit – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the whispered promises of Jerusalem's sacred ground fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but also the thrill of the unknown, the exhilaration of overcoming adversity, and the quiet satisfaction of pushing her limits.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her cockpit.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate vessels, and constantly monitoring the ship's delicate warp drive were all part of a day's work. The vast emptiness of space, while awe-inspiring, was also profoundly isolating. Yet, the knowledge that she held the key to survival for thousands fueled her, the thrill of interstellar travel a counterpoint to the loneliness of the cosmos.
