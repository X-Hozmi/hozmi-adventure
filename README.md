
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in hushed tones of the exotic spices and silks promised in the faraway city of Samarkand.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – a journey fraught with peril, but brimming with the intoxicating allure of the unknown.  His meager supplies, a worn map, and a heart full of hope were his only companions on this arduous pilgrimage across the vast expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense distances and the unimaginable technologies bridging the gaps between galaxies.   While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – the thrill of exploration burned just as brightly in Eva's heart as it had in Thomas’s, a timeless human yearning for discovery that transcended time and space.
