
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the crashing waves.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him relentlessly towards his seemingly impossible goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the inky black of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet within the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the perils of nebulae, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Advanced technology eased some burdens, but the vastness of space, the isolation, and the ever-present risk of catastrophic system failure made this voyage just as perilous, and just as thrilling, as Sir Reginald's medieval quest.
