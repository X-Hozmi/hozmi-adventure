
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each day was a battle against fatigue, hunger, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting her own course across the unmapped lands, spurred her onward.  This journey, though perilous, held the promise of a life beyond the confines of her humble existence.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast distances separating her from her home planet of Aethel.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony struggling against a hostile alien environment.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were just part of the routine.  The galaxy was a dangerous place, but Ryla, fueled by a spirit of exploration and a deep sense of responsibility, pushed onwards, a lone voyager in the endless expanse of space.
