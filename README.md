
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each arduous step, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, the promise of spiritual solace and breathtaking landscapes a reward greater than any comfort.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, new vistas, and a deepening understanding of the world beyond her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but the alien landscape of Kepler-186f awaited, a world of vibrant, bioluminescent flora and unknown dangers.  Her mission: to establish first contact.  The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the unknown challenges that lay ahead, but the potential discovery of new life, and the expansion of humanity's reach across the cosmos, fuelled her unwavering determination.
