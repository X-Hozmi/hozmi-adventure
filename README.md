
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the roads were treacherous, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from fording raging rivers to navigating treacherous mountain passes, forging their bond stronger with every hardship overcome. The lure of the sacred shrine, however, pushed them relentlessly forward, their faith a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigation through uncharted sectors was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable celestial events.  The crew, a diverse band of specialists, faced dangers both cosmic and personal, from rogue asteroids to the ever-present threat of mutiny. Yet, the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a new beginning for humanity, fueled their courage and resilience amidst the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of interstellar space.
