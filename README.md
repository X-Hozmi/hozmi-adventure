
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, bound for the rumored fertile lands beyond the Loire.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of both breathtaking beauty and terrifying danger – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the unknown.  This journey, a gamble against fate itself, was the grandest adventure of her life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The thrill of discovery warred with the chilling loneliness of interstellar space – the vast distances, the potential for encountering hostile alien life, the constant hum of the ship's engines a reminder of her fragile bubble of safety in an infinite, awe-inspiring void.
