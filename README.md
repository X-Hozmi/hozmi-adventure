
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow them whole, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires in the far distance fueled their weary limbs, promising untold riches and glory beyond the hardships of the road. Each creak of their saddles, each rustle in the long grass, promised excitement and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless gravitational pull of black holes was commonplace.  But the true adventure lay in the possibility of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery behind Kepler’s disappearance, and of discovering new alien civilizations hidden within the uncharted reaches of the galaxy. The hum of the ship's engines was a lullaby against the vast, breathtaking silence of space.
