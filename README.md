
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Ys before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – a chance encounter with bandits, a lost monastery promising shelter, or perhaps the discovery of a forgotten path leading to untold riches.  The journey was arduous, but the thrill of the unknown fueled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold gleam of distant suns and the swirling colours of nebulas, held a different kind of adventure than Elara’s.  The dangers were equally real, however –  rogue asteroids, hostile alien life forms, and the constant threat of equipment failure –  but the potential rewards, the discovery of new worlds and civilizations, were far beyond the dreams of any medieval traveler.
