
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid against a marauding horde in the far north, burned in his pocket. His journey was a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of untamed landscapes – towering forests whispering ancient secrets, treacherous mountain passes clinging to cliff edges, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered in the name of his King and country.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony clinging to existence on the planet Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the dangers weren't.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, pirate factions lurked in the shadows of unexplored star systems, and the sheer vastness of space pressed down with a crushing weight of loneliness. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the knowledge that she was pushing humanity's boundaries, fuelled her onward, a modern-day explorer charting the uncharted regions of the galaxy.
