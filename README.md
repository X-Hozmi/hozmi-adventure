
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse. Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon – demanded courage beyond measure.  The sun beat down relentlessly, and the rough terrain tested both horse and rider, yet the hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward.  She clutched the sealed scroll, a promise whispered on the wind of adventure and survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unknown celestial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, dwarfed the challenges of medieval travel, yet the same thrill of discovery, the same unwavering determination, pulsed within her as it had within Elara so many years before.  The stars were her guide, the cosmos her canvas, and the unexplored her irresistible call.
