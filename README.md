
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn leather boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to recover the lost Orb of Aethelred, rumored to hold the power to banish a creeping blight from his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send man and beast tumbling to their doom, and the whispers of ancient, vengeful spirits echoed through the desolate valleys.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been harrowing, the warp drive pushing the ship to its absolute limits.  Her mission: to establish contact with the rumored sentient crystalline lifeforms inhabiting the planet below. The dangers were far removed from brigands and blizzards – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters filled her days with a tense, electrifying energy.  The cosmos was a vast, unforgiving ocean, but the promise of discovery fueled her relentless journey.
