
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork of weary horses and even wearier men, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the sudden, unforgiving wrath of the desert sun, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled spice markets of the East, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, keeps us pushing onward, each labored step a testament to our shared thirst for adventure and fortune.  The rough-hewn map, stained with sweat and grime, is our guide, charting a course through the untamed heart of a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we jump between galaxies, a tiny speck of humanity hurtling through the cosmic void. Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  Beyond the viewport, nebulae paint breathtaking canvases across the blackness, while the distant, alluring glow of uncharted planets tempts us further into the unknown. The search for new life, for new resources, for new knowledge fuels our daring expedition, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and relentless spirit of exploration.
