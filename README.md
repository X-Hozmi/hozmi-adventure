Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, spurred them onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to overcome them. Each creak of saddle leather, each strained breath of his loyal steed, was a step closer to the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the odds.

The vibrant hues painted a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous voyage across the galaxy, their destination a rumored planet teeming with a powerful, alien energy source.
