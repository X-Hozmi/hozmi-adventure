
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plateau.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious barley seeds intended for a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for a devastating blight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grasses, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or the very elements themselves conspiring against her perilous journey.  The sun beat down relentlessly, mirroring the relentless pressure to succeed.  This was not a pilgrimage, but a desperate race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vastness of space presented its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any rescue.  The weight of responsibility for her crew, and the hope of finding the lost colonists, fueled her determination to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents and reach her destination.
