
The sun beat down on the dusty trail as Sir Gideon spurred his steed forward.  The wind whipped at his weathered face, carrying the scent of pine and the distant hum of a distant abbey.  He clutched the ancient scroll, its worn parchment whispering tales of a hidden city said to be lost in the mists of time.

Anya knew that her crew's courage and the ingenuity of her ship's technology would be their only shield against the dangers of the uncharted cosmos.
