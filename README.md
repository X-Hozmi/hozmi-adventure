
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for a perilous journey to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping blight.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, speaks of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation, all obstacles in her quest for survival and salvation.  The journey is long, the path uncertain, but the promise of healing fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to harbor a planet rich in the life-sustaining element, Xylium.  Navigation through uncharted nebulae and the constant threat of pirate raids demand unwavering focus and courage.   The vast distances and unknown dangers pale, however, in comparison to the desperate need for Xylium back on her home planet, a need that propels Ryla and her crew through the cosmos, braving the unimaginable to secure a future for their people.
