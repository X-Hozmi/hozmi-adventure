
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the rugged terrain of the Holy Roman Empire was far from over; weeks of travel still lay ahead before reaching the fabled city of Constantinople.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered stories of Constantinople's riches and the chance to prove her worth spurred her onward, despite the weariness in her bones.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive thrumming a steady rhythm against the vast emptiness of interstellar space.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and seek out habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  Alien landscapes, treacherous nebulae, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets kept the crew on high alert.  But the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, ignited a fire in Ava's heart, fueling her determination to press on toward the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
