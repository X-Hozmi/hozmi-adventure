
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Ardennes forest, was a far cry from the royal roads he was accustomed to.  Each rustle of leaves, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to possess a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  The journey was perilous, the destination uncertain, but the hope of salvation fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates was a daily challenge.  Unlike Sir Reginald's medieval journey, Elara faced threats unseen and unimaginable – cosmic radiation, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, of expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy, made the risks worthwhile.
