
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s worn boots sunk into the mire.  Her journey across the breadth of Francia was far from the tales of courtly romance; it was a grueling test of endurance.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or disease, but the promise of reaching the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness, fueled her onward.  The creak of her saddlebags, the whinny of her exhausted mare, and the endless expanse of rolling hills were the soundtrack to her perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and retrieve vital data.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was a daily hazard.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the challenges of Earth's medieval landscapes.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration, and the hope of finding the colonists kept Eva’s spirits soaring amidst the cold, dark infinity.
