
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to have joined a mercenary company far to the east.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, or disease – a constant reminder of the perilous nature of medieval travel, where the road itself was a challenge as unforgiving as any enemy.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital resources across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the cold gleam of distant stars and the reassuring hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of peril than Elara faced.  Cosmic radiation, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each interstellar jump a gamble, a testament to the relentless dangers of traversing the seemingly infinite expanse of the cosmos.
