
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains did little to deter her quest for the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each flash of a hawk overhead, was a pulse of adventure, a reminder of the perils and promises that lay ahead on this arduous journey across a vast and unforgiving land.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda Galaxy.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source, the Xylossian Heart, before the K'tharr Empire could claim it for their war machine.  With his loyal crew at his side, Razor navigated treacherous asteroid fields and dodged the relentless pursuit of pirate ships, the vastness of space both a breathtaking spectacle and a constant threat in their intergalactic race against time.
