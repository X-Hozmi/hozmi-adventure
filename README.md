
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tightly in her calloused hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains held little sway against her determination to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a heartbeat in the symphony of her perilous journey, a testament to her unwavering spirit and the allure of the unknown that lay beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', pierced the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational pulls of twin suns and avoiding asteroid fields larger than entire planets was a daily routine.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world teeming with the promise of new life and untold riches.  But the vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held secrets as ancient as the universe itself, testing Ryla’s courage and the resilience of her crew against the unforgiving backdrop of interstellar travel.
