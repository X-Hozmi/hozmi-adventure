
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the gnawing hunger in his belly.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a potent healing balm – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and into the shadowed depths of whispering forests. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the bittersweet knowledge that the journey, though arduous, was also breathtakingly beautiful.  He pushed onward, driven by hope and a stubborn refusal to yield to despair.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion to Captain Elara Vance as she navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal detected after centuries of silence.  Across light-years, she leaped, charting a course through asteroid fields and avoiding the gravity wells of dying stars.  The vast, inky blackness of space, peppered with the pinpricks of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for reconnection with a lost civilization, fueled her onward, a fire brighter than any star.
