
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and courage, as he pressed ever closer to his elusive goal across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its engines humming a low, resonant thrum as it jumped between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding colonies.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were commonplace occurrences.  The vastness of space, a beautiful yet terrifying expanse, held untold wonders and dangers, pushing Eva and her crew to the limits of their technological and human capabilities.
