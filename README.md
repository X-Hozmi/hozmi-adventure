
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of famine.  Yet, the glint of unwavering determination in her eyes mirrored the endless horizon before her, fueled by the hope of a reunion.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of space, its trajectory set for Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and traversing wormholes were commonplace hazards on her journey to colonize a new world, a feat that required bravery and cutting-edge technology.  The breathtaking views of nebulae and distant galaxies were a stark contrast to the claustrophobia of the ship’s cramped quarters, a reminder of both the vastness of the universe and the fragile human endeavour to explore it.
