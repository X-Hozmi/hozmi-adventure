
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, spurred him on, fueled by a map older than his grandfather and a heart brimming with reckless hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly from a forgotten world.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders was routine, but the vast emptiness of space, the sheer scale of the journey, held a different kind of terror, a profound loneliness only broken by the hum of the hyperdrive and the camaraderie of her crew.  The vastness of the cosmos was a daunting, breathtaking canvas for her adventure.
