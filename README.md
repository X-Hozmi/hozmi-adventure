
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy City, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, the ever-present threat of disease, and the gnawing uncertainty of their path. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, and the unwavering faith in their destination spurred them relentlessly towards their holy goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crippling loneliness of interstellar travel tested her resolve, but the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos and the weight of her responsibility drove her forward. The vastness of space held untold wonders and terrifying unknowns, but for Eva, the thrill of exploration outweighed the risk a thousand times over.
