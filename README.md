
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless; each day a tapestry woven with sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  He dreamt not of glory, but of reaching his destination, of finding solace in the holy city, far removed from the plague-ridden fields of his homeland.  The whispering wind carried tales of rival knights, haunted forests, and unforgiving landscapes, each a challenge to his resolve and a testament to the raw, brutal beauty of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth. Unlike the knights of old, her challenges weren't bandits but asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held the promise of new beginnings and untold dangers.  The stars themselves were her guide, the hum of the ship's engines a constant companion in the silent, infinite expanse.
