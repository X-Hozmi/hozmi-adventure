
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind the creaking wheels of our oxcart as we traverse the treacherous Rhône valley.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests,  fording raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, propels us onward. We trade stories with fellow travelers – grizzled knights returning from distant crusades,  merchants hauling silks and spices, and pilgrims seeking solace in far-off shrines – each a testament to the human spirit's enduring quest for the unknown.

Centuries later, the Althea leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust. We are explorers, charting unmapped territories among the stars, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The dangers are different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling silence of space itself.  But the thrill of discovery, the yearning to push beyond the known boundaries, remains a powerful and timeless force, linking our journey to those medieval travelers who dared to face the unknown on foot.
