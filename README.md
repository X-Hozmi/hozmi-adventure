
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Iberia.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the harsh sun beat down mercilessly, but the thought of her people spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of peril, but also the thrill of the unknown, a desperate gamble for survival played out against a backdrop of medieval majesty and brutal realities.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifted, and the breathtaking expanse of the galaxy unfolded before her, a breathtaking yet perilous journey demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck amongst the swirling nebulae and uncharted systems.
