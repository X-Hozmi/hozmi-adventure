
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhineland.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile seed – a legendary herb said to cure the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dense forest, held the potential for banditry or worse, yet the desperate hope in her heart fueled her onward.  She'd face down brigands, navigate treacherous mountain passes, and brave the unknown, all for the chance to save her people.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all in a day's work. The vastness of space held terrifying unknowns, but the allure of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets propelled Ryla and her crew ever further into the cosmos.
