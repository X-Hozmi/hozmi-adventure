
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the crumpled map, its edges frayed from weeks of travel across the treacherous highlands.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, storms, and the endless expanse of unforgiving wilderness tested his resolve, but the thought of his sister spurred him on, each sunrise a renewed promise of reaching his destination.  He traded stories with weary travelers, bartered for food and shelter, his journey a tapestry woven with danger and unexpected kindness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The vast, inky blackness held both wonder and peril;  uncharted asteroid fields threatened to tear apart her ship, and the unknown alien lifeforms lurking in the deep space could prove fatal. Yet, the allure of discovery, the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fueled her unwavering spirit. Every jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the infinite odds of the cosmos.
