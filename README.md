
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its creases testament to countless journeys.  This time, she sought the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to lie beyond the treacherous Black Forest, a place where magic was said to still bloom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant companions on her arduous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a breathtaking, terrifying canvas of swirling gas and distant galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the danger of rogue asteroids, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of the cosmos.
