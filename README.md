
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's writ, clutched tight in his hand, promised riches and glory in the distant city of Constantinople, but the journey was a brutal test. Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new struggle against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainty of the unknown.  Only his unwavering resolve and the flickering hope of reward pushed him further east.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than Thomas's, was no less perilous.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the ever-present risk of warp core failure, and the chilling vastness of space tested her courage and skill daily.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, fueled her determination to reach their destination, a beacon of hope amidst the infinite darkness.
