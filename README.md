
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Iberian Peninsula.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the parched undergrowth, heightened the tension.  Bandits were a constant threat,  and the whispers of plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, its silks and spices promising unimaginable riches, pushed her onward, a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Every sunset painted the sky in hues of desperation and hope, mirroring her own perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Valerian steered his starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and energy, masked the dangers lurking within – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Jax's mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of untold wonders and the chilling certainty of unknown horrors.
