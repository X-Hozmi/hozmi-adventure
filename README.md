
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains of Provence in fiery hues.  Her journey wasn't for glory or riches, but survival.  Ahead lay Avignon, rumored to hold a cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for danger – bandits, disease, or the simple unforgiving harshness of the land itself.  Her heart hammered a rhythm against her ribs, a counterpoint to the steady clop-clop of hooves, a constant reminder of the perilous adventure she'd undertaken.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky void between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint whispers of quasars and the ghostly shimmer of nebulae, her crew charted a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in generations of starlight, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace. The thrill of discovery warred with the ever-present threat of void-storms and derelict alien vessels, the silent dangers of the cosmos a constant companion to the breathtaking beauty of unexplored galaxies.
