Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones by desert nomads, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the canyons, mirages played cruel tricks on her eyes, and the relentless sun threatened to claim her as another victim of the unforgiving landscape.

With her crew relying on her sharp instincts and advanced technology, Eva braced herself for the jump to hyperspace, leaving the familiar glow of Xylos behind for the unknown wonders—and dangers—of the Kepler system.
