
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand. Her quest: to reach the legendary lost city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Ys, and the desperate hope for her brother, spurred her onward, every hardship a step closer to her impossible dream.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a newly discovered exoplanet.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling silence of interstellar space.  But Ryla, fueled by her unwavering scientific curiosity and a thirst for the unknown, pressed on, each hyperspace jump a leap into the breathtaking vastness of the galaxy,  a testament to human ambition in the face of unimaginable scale.
