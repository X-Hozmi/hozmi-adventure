
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, took them across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, shadow-haunted forests, and past villages simmering with suspicion and unrest.  Each day brought new challenges:  bandits lurking in the shadows,  the gnawing hunger in their bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown that clung to them like the dust coating their worn leather boots.  Yet, the promise of solace at journey's end, and the thrill of the adventure itself, spurred them onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory space krakens was child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting her on the planet's surface.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the vast distances between worlds and cultures remained as formidable as any medieval mountain range.  The adventure, however, was far grander, the stakes far higher, the rewards potentially unimaginable.
