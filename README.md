
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward, the muddy track a testament to weeks spent crossing the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred them onward, each aching muscle fueled by a desperate hope.

Conversely, in 2742, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and demanding the utmost precision and courage.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a constant threat; engine failures, pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel kept the crew on edge, their every action a gamble against the infinite expanse.
