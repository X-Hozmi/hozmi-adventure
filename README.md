
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or peril.  Bandits roamed these lands, and the whispers of a mythical city hidden within the mountains fuelled her journey.  She carried not just a meager supply of food and water, but also a burning curiosity, a thirst for discovery that dwarfed any fear. This journey was more than mere travel; it was a quest to etch her name into the annals of her time.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of exploring the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the vast, unpredictable expanse of the cosmos, a gamble against the crushing darkness of space. The adventure wasn't just about reaching his destination; it was the breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers of the journey itself that defined his existence.
