
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of ancient magic, had been fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings on rotting timber, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease had tested her resolve.  But the glint of the distant spires, promising untold riches and knowledge, spurred her onward, a beacon in the twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The jump gates were unreliable, fraught with temporal anomalies that threatened to tear their ship apart, and hyperspace pirates lurked in the shadows, eager to plunder their precious cargo – a vial of the mythical rejuvenating serum, their only hope of finding the colonists alive.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the answer to their quest, or perhaps only an echoing silence.
