Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a worn map, and a desperate hope of reaching the rumored monastery in the Pyrenees before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the whispered promise of a hidden cure for her ailing brother fueled her onward.
