
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers demanded cunning crossings, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival amidst the medieval tapestry of hardship and breathtaking beauty.  The road was long, the goal uncertain, but the spirit of adventure burned bright in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat considered impossible by many.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Yet, the vastness of space, the allure of undiscovered worlds, fuelled her insatiable thirst for exploration, pushing her and her crew towards the edge of the known universe.
