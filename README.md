
The year is 1347.  Dust coats my worn leather jerkin as I guide my weary mule across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier to my quest for the lost city of Eldoria.  Each sunrise brings fresh perils – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Eldoria's legendary riches and ancient knowledge fuel my journey, pushing me onward despite the hardships.  This is not a mere journey; it's a battle against the elements, against doubt, and against the unknown.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive is a constant companion.  My destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  This isn't a quest for gold, but for knowledge – the elusive secrets of the Xylan civilization, whispered to possess technology far surpassing our own.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields is a routine now, but the sheer scale of space, the breathtaking vistas of swirling nebulas and distant galaxies, never ceases to inspire awe, a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single ship in the vastness of the cosmos.
