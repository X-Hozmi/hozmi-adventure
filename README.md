
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous mountain pass to reach the fabled city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows, treacherous cliffs threatened to swallow her whole, and the biting wind promised frostbite. But the whisper of Eldoria's ancient magic, the rumored healing waters of its hidden springs, fuelled her onward, each hardship a small price to pay for the hope of a cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in perpetual twilight.  The jump to hyperspace was always risky, the potential for encountering space pirates or rogue gravitational fields a constant threat. But the reward – a fortune beyond imagining and a chance to finally upgrade his aging vessel – was worth the gamble.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space held its own brand of terror, but Razor faced it with the same steely resolve as any medieval knight facing a dragon.
