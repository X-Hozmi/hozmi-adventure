
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones amongst travelling merchants, had been fraught with peril. Bandits had lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her belly.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria's legendary riches and untold knowledge spurred her onward, each hardship a testament to her growing resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starfall" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to locate a lost colony ship believed to have discovered a new, habitable planet beyond the known galaxy.  The dangers were different, but no less real: unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks from rogue factions, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting the unknown expanse of the cosmos, fueled his courage, pushing him further into the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of space.
