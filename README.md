
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down on the parched landscape, the only company the incessant caw of ravens and the whisper of wind through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sun-baked valley, each treacherous mountain pass, held the promise of both peril and discovery, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Unlike Sir Reginald, her journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in months of hyperspace travel, punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the occasional jolt of passing asteroid fields.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, engine failures, and the unknown alien lifeforms that might inhabit Kepler-186f – the spirit of adventure burned as brightly in her heart as it had in the knight's, a testament to humanity's enduring fascination with the uncharted.
