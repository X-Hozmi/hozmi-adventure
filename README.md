Ahead lay the vast, untamed wilderness separating her village from the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold ancient magic and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, fueled her onward. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or doom.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars blurring into streaks of vibrant color outside the cockpit of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  His mission: to traverse the Andromeda galaxy, charting unexplored nebulae and seeking out new trade routes for the Galactic Federation.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, pirate fleets lurking in asteroid fields, the unpredictable nature of wormholes – but the same adventurous spirit propelled him.  Each jump to hyperspace held the potential for discovery, for unimaginable wealth, or for utter annihilation in the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
