
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he and his small band crest the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before them.  Their quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, rumored to be hidden within the treacherous Black Forest.  Each mile is a battle against the elements, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the promise of glory and the weight of their sacred duty pushes them onward.  The journey is as much a test of their faith as it is their strength.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to establish first contact with the Xylos civilization, rumored to possess technology capable of solving the energy crisis plaguing Earth.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging pirate vessels is commonplace, but the true challenge lies in bridging the vast cultural and technological gap between two species separated by light years and millennia of evolution. The journey is not merely across space, but across the uncharted territories of the unknown.
