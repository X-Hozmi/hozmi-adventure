
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle warned of the perilous journey ahead – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness. Yet, the whispered tales of the legendary lost city of Zerzura, glittering with gold and ancient wisdom, spurred her onward.  The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged with her fellow travelers, and the promise of untold riches fueled her weary steps across the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals across three galaxies, a journey that would take years even at near-lightspeed.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and the constant threat of warp-core malfunctions were just part of the routine.  But the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the alien civilizations encountered, and the camaraderie shared with his crew across the endless expanse of space, made the danger worth enduring. The future was a vast, unforgiving frontier, but the galaxy was their playground.
