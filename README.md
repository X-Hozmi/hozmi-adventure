
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious map, promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the secret to a miraculous healing balm.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the journey, each challenge forging her resolve and proving her courage.  The destination was uncertain, the dangers real, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora and fauna and guarded by unpredictable gravitational currents.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers of space remained formidable – asteroid fields, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  The vastness of the cosmos instilled a sense of both wonder and trepidation, pushing Ryla and her crew to the limits of their skill and endurance.
