
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumours that spurred him on – whispers of a lost city shimmering with gold, guarded by mythical creatures and treacherous terrain. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and untold riches.  His journey, a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, fear, and unwavering determination, stretched before him like an endless, challenging path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship's frame, a constant reminder of the immense distances separating them from Earth and the countless unforeseen dangers lurking in the uncharted reaches of space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fuelled by humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration and the promise of a future beyond the stars.
