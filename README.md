
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by whispered tales and ancient maps, keeps her pushing onward, her determination a shield against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving his dying planet.  Warp jumps between galaxies bring unpredictable gravitational anomalies and encounters with sentient space flora and fauna.  The vastness of space itself is a daunting adversary, but the promise of survival for his people fuels his journey, a perilous odyssey across the cosmos.
