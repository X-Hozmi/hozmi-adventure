
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Seraphina, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the Inquisition's agents, hunting those who dared question the Church's authority.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with breathtaking landscapes, terrifying encounters, and the unwavering hope that fueled her weary steps.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck against the infinite canvas of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp drives hummed, dodging asteroid fields and the silent, watchful eyes of unknown celestial entities.  The vast emptiness held both terrifying loneliness and the exhilarating promise of discovery, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a testament to humanity's boundless ambition to reach for the stars.
