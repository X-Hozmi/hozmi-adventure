
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to curing her ailing brother.  The journey is fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, hostile lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the allure of Ys, a glimmer of hope against the backdrop of a dying world, keeps her spurred onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored paradise teeming with uncharted flora and potentially valuable resources.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate patrols is a daily routine, but the vast, unknowable expanse of space holds a thrill far surpassing any earthly adventure.  The galaxy is his playground, a tapestry woven with untold wonders and unimaginable dangers; the price of discovery is high, but the rewards... potentially limitless.
