
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Black Forest, offered little comfort against the biting chill and the ever-present threat of brigands. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a stark contrast to the quiet beauty of the ancient trees towering above. His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril but essential to the realm’s survival.  The road ahead promised hardship, but also the exhilaration of facing the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of stars and the hum of her ship's engines, held a different kind of thrill.  Navigation charts, advanced sensors, and sophisticated technology were her tools, but the unpredictable nature of space travel – asteroid fields, solar flares, the ever-present risk of system failures – kept her alert and her heart pounding. The reward?  The potential discovery of new life, a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
