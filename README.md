
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome felt endless, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched fields, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a ford to cross, a village to barter with, a rumor of plague to avoid.  He carried with him not gold, but a sacred relic, a mission that fueled his weary bones and spurred him onward despite the hardships. The adventure was not in the destination, but in the relentless struggle against nature and man.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, peppered with shimmering stars and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, was a different kind of wilderness than Thomas had faced.  Instead of bandits, she navigated political intrigue and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  The adventure lay not just in reaching a new world, but in the unknowns it held, the discoveries it promised, and the challenges posed by traversing the cosmic ocean.
