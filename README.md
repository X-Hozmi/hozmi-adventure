
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles swallowed since leaving Canterbury.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray I'd left behind.  Ahead, the rumored lost city of Eldoria beckoned, a whisper on the wind promising both untold riches and perilous encounters with bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise was a gamble, each nightfall a prayer for survival. This journey, far from the comforts of court, was a test of will and endurance.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cockpit.  Outside, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted the viewport in a kaleidoscope of impossible colours, a far cry from the muddy tracks of my ancestors.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a world teeming with uncharted wonders and possibly, hostile alien life.  The thrill wasn't in the mere act of travel, but the knowledge that this voyage represented the furthest reach of humankind, a testament to our relentless curiosity and our insatiable thirst for discovery amidst the cold, uncaring expanse of space.
