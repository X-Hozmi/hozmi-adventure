
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's ragged caravan lumbered across the parched plains.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a heartbeat against the vast silence, broken only by the occasional hawk cry overhead.  Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and forgotten magic, had already claimed two men to sunstroke and bandits, yet Elara pressed on, spurred by both greed and a desperate need to escape the famine gripping her homeland. The endless horizon held both terrifying promise and the faintest glimmer of hope.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's swirling colours.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, plotting a course through uncharted sectors towards the Xylos system, a cluster whispered to harbour ancient alien artifacts.  The journey was perilous, filled with the unpredictable dangers of rogue asteroids and hostile space pirates, yet the thrill of exploration outweighed the risk.  For Rexx, the vast emptiness between stars held not loneliness, but the intoxicating freedom of limitless possibility.
