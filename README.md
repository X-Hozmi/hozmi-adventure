
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of the unknown, the chance to unravel history's mysteries, pushed him relentlessly forward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with perilous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Advanced technology eased some hardships, but the isolation and the sheer scale of interstellar travel presented unique challenges – loneliness, the slow creep of time dilation, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive a constant reminder of the vast, unknowable expanse between the stars.
