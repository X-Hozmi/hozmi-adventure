
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the relentless grip of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a beacon brighter than any star.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The void pressed in, a suffocating silence broken only by the hum of the hyperdrive and the crackle of the comms.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of uncharted alien encounters. But the promise of a new home, a new beginning, fuelled her relentless journey.
