
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, spurred his destrier onward.  The wind whipped across the bleak, rain-lashed moors, a stark contrast to the tales of sun-drenched vineyards and bustling cities that had lured him from his ancestral castle. His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each ford of a rushing stream, was a gamble, a step closer to either salvation or a nameless grave beneath a starless sky.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  The vast distances were a challenge, the unpredictable wormhole jumps a constant threat, but the thought of terraforming a new world, of planting the seeds of a future free from Earth's failings, fueled her every decision.  The cosmos held both wonder and peril, a breathtaking expanse of possibilities and dangers equally vast.
