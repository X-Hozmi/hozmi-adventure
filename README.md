
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary horse as he navigated the treacherous, overgrown track through the Black Forest.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each rustle of leaves, each shadow cast by the ancient trees, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Yet the whispered promises of Eldoria, and the love for his sister, spurred him onward, his resolve hardened by the miles of unforgiving terrain already conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of distant galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, swallowed by a nebula centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable nature of wormholes, Elara and her crew faced cosmic perils unimaginable to medieval travelers.  But the hope of finding survivors, and uncovering the secrets of Xylos’s disappearance, fueled their journey across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
