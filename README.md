
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked frame, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a hazy brown plume marking their passage across the unforgiving plains.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones by weary travelers – a haven of untold riches and perhaps, salvation from the encroaching famine.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his horse, was a testament to the perils and uncertainties of this medieval pilgrimage.  Bandits, disease, and the vast, unknown wilderness itself presented constant threats.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a glittering tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of solar flares demanded unwavering focus and precision.  This was no mere journey; it was a gamble on the future of humanity, a desperate search for a new home among the cold, indifferent stars.
