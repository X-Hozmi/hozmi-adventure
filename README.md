
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rutted track barely visible beneath the late autumn mud.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of our exhausted mounts echoed the growing tension; whispers of bandits, and more terrifyingly, the Black Death itself, clung to the air thicker than the woodsmoke from distant villages. Our quest, to reach the fabled monastery said to hold the cure for a plague ravaging our homeland, pushed us through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving plains, a constant test of endurance and will.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The crimson glow of Kepler-186f bathed our starship in an ethereal light as we navigated the nebula, its swirling gases a breathtaking, yet perilous, tapestry.  Our mission, to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, required traversing wormholes and dodging asteroid fields, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace. The vast emptiness between worlds was a constant reminder of our isolation, yet the promise of discovery, of connecting with our lost brethren, fuelled our journey across the uncharted cosmos.
