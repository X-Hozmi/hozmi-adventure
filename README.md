
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin stained with the mud of a thousand miles, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the fractured kingdom had been fraught with peril: brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes blanketed in snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the distant spires of Camelot, his destination and the seat of the King, spurred him onward.  He carried a desperate plea, a message of vital importance that could determine the fate of his people.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the perils of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue planets, and battling the ever-present threat of space pirates were all in a day's work.  But the potential discovery of a new, habitable world, and the possibility of saving the lost colonists, made the unimaginable risks worth taking.
