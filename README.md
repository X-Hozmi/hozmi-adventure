
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised purple sky.  Her worn map, a testament to countless journeys, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her relentless trek across the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the perils and the potential rewards that lay ahead.  She pressed on, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent backdrop of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula, vibrant colours swirling around her ship like cosmic paint.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way, a journey fraught with the dangers of gravitational anomalies and uncharted asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, held its own kind of medieval-like allure. The thrill of discovery, the push against the limits of human exploration, echoed the spirit of those ancient travelers, though their tools and the scale of their challenges were vastly different.
