
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses' hooves kicking up clouds of ochre.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled them onward, their determination fueled by whispered legends and the shimmering promise of adventure beyond the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with dangers unseen.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable forces of interdimensional rifts were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic wonders, held both immense peril and unparalleled beauty, tempting her further into the uncharted regions of the cosmos.
