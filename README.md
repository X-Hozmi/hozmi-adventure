
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant wolves.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the hope of salvation spurred him on through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the perils of space – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the unnerving vastness of the cosmos – was a test of both skill and fortitude.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, fueled her and her crew, propelling them across the galactic expanse in their relentless pursuit of the unknown.
