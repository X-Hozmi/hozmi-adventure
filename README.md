
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous bogs swallowing whole wagons, and the constant threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Sunstone, said to hold the power of kings, pushed him relentlessly forward, each mile a testament to his courage and unwavering resolve.  He dreamt not of comfortable inns, but of the glory that awaited him at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been smoother than anticipated, but the subsequent hyperspace transit had tested the ship's engines to their limits.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from a newly discovered planet, a journey fraught with the dangers of alien lifeforms, unpredictable celestial events, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the potential scientific breakthrough spurred them on, the vast, inky blackness of space their only companion in this audacious interstellar voyage.
