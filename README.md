
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing uncertainty of the endless horizon. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fuels her onward, a testament to the indomitable spirit of a medieval adventurer pushing against the boundaries of a known world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Instead of bandits, she faces cosmic storms that threaten to rip her ship apart; instead of rivers, she navigates asteroid fields.  The vast, inky blackness of space holds both wonder and peril, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving laws of physics.  Yet, like Elara, Ryla is driven by a burning ambition to push beyond the known frontiers of humankind.
