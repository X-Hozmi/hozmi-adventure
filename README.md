
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He’d left the familiar comfort of his village weeks ago, drawn by whispers of a lost city brimming with gold and forgotten magic, nestled deep within the whispering forests of the Black Mire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a new challenge, a potential encounter with bandits, wild beasts, or the very magic he sought.  He carried only a worn map, a rusty sword, and a heart full of desperate hope.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, the kaleidoscope of colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the navigation console. Her mission: to locate the elusive Xylos artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across light years, she navigated asteroid fields, dodged pirate ships, and battled unpredictable gravitational pulls, her crew a diverse band bound together by ambition and the shared thrill of exploring the uncharted regions of the galaxy.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the immense risks and potentially unimaginable rewards of their perilous journey.
