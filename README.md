
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with the weight of meager supplies and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her aging mule was a symphony of anticipation and trepidation; bandits roamed these desolate lands, and the whispering winds carried tales of mythical beasts guarding ancient ruins.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, with its promised riches and lost knowledge, fueled her onward, her heart pounding with the rhythm of adventure echoing through the desolate landscape.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a terraformed planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.   Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, a test of skill and nerve.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held more challenges than any medieval kingdom;  yet, the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, ignited a fire within Ryla that burned brighter than any earthly ambition.
