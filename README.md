The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the rumours that spurred his journey – whispers of a lost city, brimming with gold and ancient magic, nestled deep within the Whisperwind Mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuelled both his excitement and a gnawing fear of the unknown dangers that lay ahead: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reminder of the colossal distances and the technological marvel that allowed humanity to reach for the stars.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both wonder and peril – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, both benevolent and malevolent, filled her heart with a mixture of thrill and trepidation.
