
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains of Anatolia as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Samarkand's healing balm spurred them on, fueling their weary bodies and unwavering resolve amidst the brutal beauty of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble fueled by the desperate search for a new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable currents of hyperspace were mere inconveniences compared to the potential discovery awaiting them – a planet teeming with life, or the cold emptiness of interstellar space.  The fate of her people rested on the successful completion of this interstellar odyssey.
