
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving desert itself.  Yet, the glint of the distant, shimmering mirage fueled her onward, a promise of adventure and, perhaps, salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily hazard, a far cry from the simpler dangers of medieval travel.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey requiring not just courage but advanced technology and unwavering determination.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of allure, a thrilling loneliness that echoed the solitary expanse of the ancient plains.
