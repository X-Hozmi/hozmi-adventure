
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test the limits of both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new river to ford, all while the weight of his sacred mission presses upon his shoulders.  His compass, a worn leather-bound book of maps and prayers, guides him towards his uncertain destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable power rumored to exist on a remote, uncharted planet.  Warp drives hum, defying the vast emptiness between galaxies, while the ever-present danger of pirate attacks and unforeseen celestial events keep her crew on high alert.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, guided only by the flickering light of her navigational console and the unwavering belief in her crew’s capabilities.  The galaxy stretches before her, a limitless expanse of adventure and untold mysteries.
