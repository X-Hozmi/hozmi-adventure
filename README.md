
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each sunrise brought a fresh panorama of jagged peaks and hidden valleys, a tapestry woven with the whispers of ancient legends and the ever-present threat of bandits.  My quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the abbey nestled deep in the southern plains, demanded resilience beyond measure, a testament to the unwavering spirit of those who dared to wander the unforgiving medieval landscape.  Every rustle of leaves, every shadow in the twilight, held the promise of adventure – and peril.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant lullaby as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport were breathtaking, a cosmic dance of vibrant colours that dwarfed the wildest imaginings of medieval mapmakers. Our mission, to locate and secure a lost colony on the fringes of known space, demanded skill and courage far removed from the trials of medieval travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional flicker of alien starships, held the promise of both untold wonders and catastrophic unknowns; a future where exploration meant navigating not mountains, but asteroid fields and black holes.
