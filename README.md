
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path, wound through a primeval forest, its shadows teeming with unseen dangers.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead, across treacherous mountains and unforgiving plains, populated by bandits and beasts far more fearsome than any dragon in legend.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the unknown dangers lurking within the anomaly itself.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held secrets older than time, and Eva, a lone explorer in a galaxy of wonders and horrors, was determined to unravel them, one warp jump at a time.
