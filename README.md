The sun beat down on the dusty track, a ribbon unwinding through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes guarded by snow and ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Yet, the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, fuelled her unwavering determination.
