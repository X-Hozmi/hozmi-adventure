
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Days bled into weeks, marked by meager rations, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, the burning hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, indifferent darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  Vast, swirling galaxies painted the viewport, a breathtaking panorama far removed from the familiar blue marble of Earth.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Kepler-186f system, a planet potentially habitable for humanity.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly.  Jax, like Elara before her, pushed against the limits of the known, fueled by a desire to explore and discover the mysteries that lay beyond.
