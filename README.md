
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions – a chipped compass, a well-thumbed map, and a small, silver amulet blessed by the village priest.  Ahead lay the unknown: a treacherous journey across the Iberian Peninsula, seeking the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Navigating the treacherous currents of the Cygnus X-1 system, she charted a course towards Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The potential rewards – unimaginable technological advancements – were matched only by the existential threats lurking in the dark corners of the galaxy.
