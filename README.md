
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a constant test of his endurance and spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outwitting space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation were all part of a day's work.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover the fate of her ancestors, propelled her forward, a lone star charting a course through the infinite expanse.
