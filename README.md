
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, propelled her onward, each sunrise a new chapter in her perilous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a breathtaking spectacle against the inky blackness of space.  His mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  The challenges weren't bandits or starvation, but cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  Yet, the vastness of space, the potential for discovery, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled his unwavering spirit.
