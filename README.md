
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread, a chipped flint, and the tattered map guiding her towards the fabled city of Zamora.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – a testament to the raw, untamed adventure that defined travel in the medieval world. Every step was a gamble, every sunrise a fresh start in a land where survival was the greatest prize.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, was fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raiders, and maintaining the ship's delicate warp drive were all in a day's work. This wasn't just a journey across space, but a voyage through the unknown, a gamble with the vastness and indifference of the cosmos.  The reward, however, promised a future beyond human comprehension.
