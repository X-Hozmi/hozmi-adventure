
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his mount onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a tangible record of their journey across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered about in smoky taverns and hushed tones, spurred them onward, a beacon in the darkness of their arduous trek. The clang of steel against steel, the cries of men, and the desperate hope of finding fortune or glory fueled their every step.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained: unpredictable spatial anomalies, pirate raids on hyperspace lanes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and hostile lifeforms.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous but essential journey for the survival of humanity’s burgeoning interstellar empire.  The cold vacuum of space and the vast unknown held far more fear than any earthly foe could ever muster.
