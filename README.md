
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies – it held the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands east of the Rhine, away from the gnawing famine that gripped their village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the familiar. Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions on this arduous pilgrimage.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a stark contrast to the vibrant nebulae swirling past their viewport.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage fraught with unknown celestial phenomena and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, driven by a thirst for discovery and the promise of unimaginable riches – or utter annihilation.
