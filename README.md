
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she spurred her mare onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey, yet the hope of Ys fueled her onward, each sunrise a new gamble against the odds.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offered fleeting comfort, a temporary reprieve before the vast, unforgiving landscape reclaimed her once more.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of solar flares tested the crew's skill and resolve.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on them, the familiar comfort of Earth a distant memory.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for finding a new home among the stars, spurred them onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
