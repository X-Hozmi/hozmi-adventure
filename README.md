
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of reuniting with her estranged brother, rumored to be hiding amongst the mercenary bands raiding the southern borders.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of adventure, the burning desire for family, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital xenobiological samples across three galaxies, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of interdimensional rifts and pirate raids.  Advanced technology offered protection, but the vastness of space, the loneliness of interstellar travel, and the unpredictable nature of alien encounters, made this odyssey far from simple. The thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, fueled his daring voyage.
