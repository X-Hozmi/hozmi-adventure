
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the creak of his saddle.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in his dogged pursuit of glory and knowledge, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and peril.  The journey was testing his physical limits and his faith, but the allure of the unknown fueled his relentless advance.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship rumored to have discovered a new hyperspace route.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders in heavily-modified freighters, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all part of the daily grind.  The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, presented an entirely different type of adventure – one where the stakes were galactic, and the rewards, potentially epoch-defining.
