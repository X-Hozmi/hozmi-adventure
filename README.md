
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey across the breadth of England, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the weather threatened to drown them, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at their bellies.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory against the elements and the uncertainties of the road.  Yet, the whispered tales of miracles and the unwavering faith of the pilgrims spurred them on, forging a bond of shared hardship and purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigation relied on antiquated star charts and the ever-faltering hyperdrive, the vast emptiness of space both a terrifying and wondrous expanse.  Each jump through hyperspace risked catastrophic failure, each alien system encountered presented new, unpredictable dangers. But the hope of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of the lost colony, propelled her onward, a testament to human resilience against the daunting scale of the cosmos.
