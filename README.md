
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, more faded than a tapestry, was her only guide through the treacherous war-torn lands.  Each day was a gamble – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, starvation gnawed at their heels, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the humid air. Yet, the promise of a new life in the distant Italian city spurred her onward, a beacon of hope in the grey expanse.  This journey, though fraught with peril, was her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  The Xylos system, a legendary cluster rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, lay ahead.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced perils of a different kind: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  This was not a journey across a continent, but across the vast emptiness between worlds, a quest for knowledge that could change the fate of galaxies.  This was their adventure.
