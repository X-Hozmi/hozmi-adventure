
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn map, a patchwork of whispers and legends, offers little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unpredictable whims of nature.  But the allure of the Silk Road, the promise of exotic spices and untold riches, fuels her onward, a single woman navigating a world both terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful.  Every creak of the saddle, every distant hawk's cry, is a pulse of the adventure beating in her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life unlike anything humanity has ever encountered.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes is a constant test of skill and nerve.  Unlike Elara, Eva has the technology to overcome many obstacles, yet the vast, unknowable expanse of space breeds a different kind of fear, a cosmic loneliness punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the faint, hopeful glow of distant stars.  The frontier of space, while technologically advanced, still holds the same raw, intoxicating allure of adventure.
