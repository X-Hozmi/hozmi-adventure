
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d traded his meager inheritance for a mule-drawn cart laden with spices and silks, bound for the distant city of Constantinople.  Each creak of the wheels, each flash of steel from a passing mercenary band, was a thrill, a reminder of the unpredictable, vibrant life he’d chosen, one far removed from the quiet drudgery of his village.  Bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of disease were but small prices to pay for the adventure of crossing the vast and perilous landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the swirling cosmic dust.   While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the thrill of exploration remained the same.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble with destiny in a universe teeming with wonder and untold possibilities.
