
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as we navigated treacherous mountain passes, the air thick with the scent of camel dung and impending storms. Each sunset brought the chilling possibility of bandit raids, and each sunrise the renewed hope of reaching Constantinople, a city shimmering like a mirage in the distance – a promise of safety, trade, and perhaps, a chance encounter with fate itself.


Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* sliced through the inky void, its engines a low hum against the silence of interstellar space. Captain Eva Rostova steered her vessel towards Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson light of its red dwarf sun.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, punctuated by the occasional meteor shower and the ever-present, watchful gaze of the nebulae.  The quest for habitable worlds was a perilous one, but the potential for discovery – for a new beginning amongst the stars – fuelled their tireless voyage across the galaxy.
