
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glint of Eldoria’s rumored spires, a beacon in his mind, fueled his weary steps, pushing him further across the unforgiving landscape of a medieval Europe teeming with both peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, yet the journey remained fraught with danger.  Rogue asteroids, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded constant vigilance.  But the promise of a new world, a chance to build a future amongst the stars, spurred Eva onward, her eyes fixed on the distant green jewel of Kepler-186f, a symbol of human ambition in the vast, uncharted cosmos.
