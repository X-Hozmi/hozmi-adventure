
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and guarded by creatures of nightmare.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and skirmishes with bandits. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, a testament to the adventurous spirit that burned bright even in the shadow of the plague-ridden lands.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril from unpredictable gravitational fields and potential encounters with unknown alien civilizations.  The vast emptiness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, like those medieval knights before her, was driven by a thirst for discovery, a courage that transcended time and place, propelled by the human need to explore the furthest reaches of existence.
