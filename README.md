
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the constant gnawing threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of Zerzura, fueled his relentless journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanite crystals across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling unpredictable temporal distortions were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space offered breathtaking vistas of unimaginable beauty, but also held terrifying unknowns.  The journey was perilous, the stakes impossibly high, but Eva, a seasoned explorer, pushed onward, driven by the unwavering spirit of adventure that bound her to the stars.
