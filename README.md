
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles in her relentless pursuit. Each sunrise brought new dangers, but also the promise of breathtaking landscapes and the thrill of the unknown, a testament to the adventurous spirit burning fiercely within her.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a humanity struggling with resource depletion on a dying Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent majesty of distant stars and the occasional flash of a hyper-jump, held a different kind of peril – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the threat of cosmic radiation, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the potential rewards – a new home for humanity – fuelled her onward, a modern-day explorer seeking her own version of a promised land amongst the stars.
