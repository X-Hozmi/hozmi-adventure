
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds not just supplies but the King's urgent missive, a perilous journey to deliver vital news to the besieged city of Avignon.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her desperate race against time, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown dangers that lie ahead.  The wind whispers secrets of both beauty and brutality, reflecting the uncertain future that awaits her.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', a vessel capable of traversing the vast distances between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the clutches of K'tharr pirates, and deciphering ancient star charts are all part of her arduous voyage.  The cosmic expanse, a breathtaking canvas of nebulae and distant suns, holds both wonder and peril, a testament to the courage and ingenuity required to explore the infinite frontiers of space.
