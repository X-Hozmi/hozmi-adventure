
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant storms. His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Brigid, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy heart of the Whispering Woods, where brigands and worse things lurked in the deepening twilight. Each sunrise brought new challenges – starvation, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of ambush.  His loyalty to his King, and the burning desire to prove his worth, drove him ever closer to his perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The ship, a marvel of futuristic engineering, jumped between star systems, its hyperdrive a hum against the deafening silence of space.  Eva's mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the unknown terrors that might lurk in the uncharted reaches of the cosmos. The weight of her crew's survival, and the fate of a forgotten civilization, rested on her shoulders as she navigated the infinite expanse.
