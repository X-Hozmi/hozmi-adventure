
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, each sunset a quiet victory against the unforgiving elements and the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  But the whispers of miracles and the unwavering faith in her heart fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and filled with the promise of discovery.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was routine, but the thrill of encountering alien lifeforms – both benevolent and hostile – was anything but.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable desire to explore the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
