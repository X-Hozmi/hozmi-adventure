
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees mountains did little to deter her; she sought the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the uncertain path before her, a path paved with medieval grit and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the attention of the Kryll raiders was all in a day's work for her seasoned crew.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos artifact, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  The vastness of space held a different kind of danger, a cosmic scale of uncertainty, yet the thrill of discovery – the promise of charting unmapped territories – fueled her journey across the star-strewn canvas of the universe.
