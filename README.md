
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she crests the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees silhouetted against a bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, barely legible after weeks of rain and sweat, promises a hidden monastery harboring ancient wisdom – a destination worth risking brigands, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat, but the lure of the unknown fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy is measured not in days, but in generations, yet the quest for the mythical Xylos crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, compels her crew.  Alien landscapes flash past their viewport – swirling gas giants, icy moons, and planets teeming with undiscovered life. The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the immense scale of their adventure.
