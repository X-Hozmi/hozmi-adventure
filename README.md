
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, the salty air thick with the promise of adventure.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked its way across the sun-baked plains of Provence, then climbed the treacherous Pyrenees, the scent of pine and fear clinging to the air.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But with every sunrise, the thrill of discovery pushed us onward, towards the fabled spice markets of the Orient, a land of untold riches and unimaginable dangers.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Leaving the familiar, swirling nebula of the Crab, we jumped across the vast emptiness between galaxies, charting a course through unmapped star clusters towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our mission: to locate the legendary Xylos, a planet said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – rogue asteroids, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  But the potential reward, the chance to unlock the universe's greatest secrets, fueled our tireless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
