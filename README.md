
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue crested the windswept pass, their horses’ hooves jarring loose pebbles that tumbled down the mountainside.  Ahead stretched the vast, untamed expanse of the Ardennes Forest, a tapestry of emerald and shadow rumored to hold both forgotten Roman ruins and terrifying beasts.  Their quest – to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas and retrieve a sacred relic – was a perilous journey across kingdoms, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to their survival.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a tapestry of warp jumps and gravitational slingshots, was a test of both technology and human endurance.  Cosmic storms threatened to shatter their vessel, while the vast emptiness of space pressed in on them, a constant reminder of their fragility in the face of the universe's awesome indifference.  Yet, the allure of discovery burned brighter than any star.
