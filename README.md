
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and dried meats.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Forest were constant companions on her journey from Avignon to Constantinople, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, danger, and the unexpected kindness of strangers encountered along the rough-hewn path.  Her destination felt impossibly distant, but with every sunrise, she pressed onward, driven by hope and fueled by grit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous search for the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Ryla relied on her wits, her trusty crew, and the cutting-edge technology of her vessel.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of the cosmos, promising riches, discovery, and the ever-present threat of annihilation.
