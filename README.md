
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains in hues of blood orange and fading gold.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons, and the desert itself tested her endurance with relentless heat and scarce water.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed resolve fueled by the hope of finding the legendary lost city and the treasures it supposedly held.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth, was measured not in days or weeks, but in subjective time warped by faster-than-light travel.  While the physical dangers were less immediate than Elara's, the psychological toll of interstellar space – the isolation, the constant hum of the engines, the ever-present possibility of system failure – proved a formidable challenge.  Yet, the lure of discovery, of finding life beyond Earth, propelled Eva and her crew onwards, towards the unknown.
