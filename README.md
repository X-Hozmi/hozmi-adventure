
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she squinted at the endless expanse of the Breton countryside.  Her worn leather boots, already softened by weeks of relentless travel, pounded the rutted track.  Each creak of her saddle, each whinny from her faithful mare, was a small victory against the vast unknown.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispers of plague stalked the villages, yet the lure of the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous mountains, propelled her onward.  The thrill of the unknown, the challenge of survival, the whispered legends – these were the fuel of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  as it jumped to hyperspace.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a kaleidoscope of impossible colours, a testament to the boundless universe awaiting exploration.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and lost alien civilizations. The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel – but the spirit of adventure remained the same, an unwavering flame burning bright against the cold vastness of space.
