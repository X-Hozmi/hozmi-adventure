
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Jude – had led him far from his castle, across treacherous mountain passes and through dense, bandit-infested forests.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager rations in forgotten villages, and constantly evading the shadowy figures who also sought the saint's power.  His journey was a tapestry woven from hardship and hope, each sunrise a promise of reaching his ultimate goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating hyperspace, dodging asteroid fields the size of moons, and facing the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were all in a day's work.  The vast, uncaring expanse of the galaxy pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the staggering distances separating humanity from its lost brethren.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
