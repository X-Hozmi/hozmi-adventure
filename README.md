
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present uncertainty of the treacherous mountain pass ahead. Yet, the whisper of a legendary lost city, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward.  The grueling journey tested her limits, but the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of uncovering history, fueled her relentless pace.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was a daily occurrence; the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space was a constant reminder of the perils of interstellar exploration. But the potential rewards – the chance to rewrite the laws of physics and open up a new era of galactic exploration – were too enticing to resist, making even the most dangerous journey worthwhile.
