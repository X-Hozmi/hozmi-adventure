
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under the grey sky, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that tested the resolve of even the most seasoned knight.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it offered, pushed him relentlessly towards the unknown.  He carried with him not only his sword, but the prayers of his people.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was child's play compared to the cosmic anomalies and unpredictable warp currents that threatened to shatter her ship.  Yet, Elara held fast, driven by the echoes of a forgotten people and the promise of discovery amongst the stars.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrible peril and breathtaking beauty, a landscape as unforgiving and alluring as any medieval battlefield.
