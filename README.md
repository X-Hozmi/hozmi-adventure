
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a familiar comfort amidst the looming uncertainties of his journey.  He carried a King's decree, a sealed parchment tucked into his worn satchel, a perilous mission that would take him across treacherous mountains and lawless plains, into the heart of a rebellious province.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this medieval pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  She navigated asteroid fields, dodged rogue gravitational pulls, and monitored energy signatures for any sign of hostile vessels.  This journey, unlike Thomas's, was technologically advanced, but no less perilous; the dangers were just different, the vastness of space as daunting as the endless plains of the medieval world.
