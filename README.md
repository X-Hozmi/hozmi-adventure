
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest, undertaken to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, had already claimed three of his companions.  Each day was a battle against the elements, ravenous wolves, and the ever-present fear of bandits.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's unimaginable riches, and the chance to escape his impoverished village, fuelled his weary steps. He clutched a tattered map, its promises a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital hyperspace relay station on the far side of the galaxy.  The journey was a perilous dance with gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields, a test of both her skill and the ship's endurance.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae and the cold, harsh light of distant suns, held a terrifying beauty.  But Eva, driven by the promise of galactic unity and a thirst for exploration, pressed on, her sights fixed on the distant beacon of Xylos IV.
