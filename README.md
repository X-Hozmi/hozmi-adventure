
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay Florence, a whispered promise of trade and perhaps, a way to escape the crippling famine gripping her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the ever-present shadow of disease.  But the hope of a better life fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any star.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the cosmos a breathtaking panorama of nebulas and distant galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across lightyears and through uncharted space.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, the only sound louder than the thrum of her own anxious heart.  Unknown dangers lurked in the void, but the potential reward – the rediscovery of a lost civilization – made the risk worthwhile.
