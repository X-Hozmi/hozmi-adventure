
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s mule picked its way across the parched landscape.  Her worn leather satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, swung against her thigh.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far less daunting than the rumour of a lost city, buried beneath shifting sands for centuries.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, marauding wolves, and the chilling uncertainty of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the whisper of forgotten magic, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s vibrant tapestry.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril; asteroid fields threatened to shatter their hull, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes demanded precise navigation.  But the thrill of exploration, the possibility of unlocking the galaxy's greatest secrets, outweighed the risks.  Ryla, gazing at the swirling cosmic dust, knew this was only the beginning of an uncharted voyage through the boundless expanse of space.
