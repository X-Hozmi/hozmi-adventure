
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power, guarded by treacherous mountain passes and wilder folk. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the sense of perilous adventure.  He carried with him only a battered map, a worn sword, and the unshakeable belief in the legends he’d chased across half a continent.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the pathways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' a sleek starship slicing through the nebulae of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar longevity.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional flicker of distant suns, was a breathtaking, yet daunting backdrop to their quest. The risks were astronomical, but the potential rewards could rewrite the history of humanity itself.
