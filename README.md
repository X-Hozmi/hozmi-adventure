
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, our destination the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadows, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurs us onward, a shared dream binding us together against the harsh realities of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, charting unmapped nebulae and encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  The thrill isn't just in the journey, but in the discoveries – new planets teeming with bizarre life, ancient ruins whispering forgotten histories, and the constant challenge of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace. Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos, but the potential rewards are beyond imagining.
