
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her destrier across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  The scent of sun-baked earth and distant smoke hangs heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurk beyond the next ridge.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing uncertainty of bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of unpredictable weather.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of Constantinople and its promised riches, keeps her pushing onward, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating freedom.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Faster-than-light travel has shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remain vast and varied – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. But the promise of discovering new worlds, charting unmapped star systems, and uncovering the secrets of the cosmos fuels her intrepid spirit, a legacy of explorers who dared to venture where no one had gone before.
