
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promised both peril and the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis teeming with untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, heightened the thrill of the unknown. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on this arduous journey, but the lure of adventure burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Drifter* cutting a silent path through cosmic dust.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  This wasn't a quest for gold or glory, but for a new home, a new beginning for a dwindling human race. The vastness of space, however, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters. The galaxy itself was a living, breathing entity, equally beautiful and terrifying.
