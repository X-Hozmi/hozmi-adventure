
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he urged the weary animal onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in rocky canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glimmer of hope, fueled by whispered legends and unwavering determination, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by ancient alien star maps.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's nightmares.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while unknown sentient entities lurked in the void between stars.  But Eva, fueled by the hope of reunion with long-lost kin, bravely navigated the unimaginable expanse, fueled by advanced technology and an indomitable spirit.
