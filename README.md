
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees looming before her like the teeth of some slumbering giant. Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the King's decree – a perilous journey to the far east to secure a rare silk for the Queen's upcoming coronation.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown, the thrill of forging her own path across a continent teeming with secrets and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, the vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold steel of her command bridge.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present danger of encountering uncharted anomalies – but the potential reward, the possibility of opening up interstellar trade and forging alliances across galaxies, was worth the risk. The vast expanse of space held an allure as powerful as any medieval kingdom.
