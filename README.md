
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each arduous mile, her spirit soared; the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the unwavering faith in her quest fueled her onward, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the challenges were no less daunting.  Warp storms threatened to tear her ship apart, alien scavengers prowled the void, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested even her hardened spirit.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding survivors, and the vast, unexplored universe beckoned her onwards, a solitary explorer charting a course through the cosmic sea.
