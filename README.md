
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plateau stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the relentless sun, but the thrill of her journey – a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, a quest to find her missing brother – fueled her onward.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, with every sunrise, a renewed sense of hope bloomed, spurred by the whispered tales of distant lands and the unwavering strength of her spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of crimson and gold against the inky black of space. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with perils: unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields that threatened to shatter her vessel, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover new life and expand humanity's reach among the stars, outweighed every risk.  The vastness of space held a promise of untold wonders, beckoning her ever further into the cosmic unknown.
