
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled her nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales of spices and silks whispered from the faraway port cities she aimed to reach.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger—bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the promise of adventure a beacon brighter than any flickering torch.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Starseeker*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The nebulae outside her viewport swirled in breathtaking colours, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart unexplored systems, seeking habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The risks were astronomical—uncharted gravitational fields, unknown alien life forms, the ever-present possibility of system failure—but the reward, the discovery of new worlds and civilizations, was a siren song too powerful to resist.
