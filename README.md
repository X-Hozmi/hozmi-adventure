
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring rains, and whispers of the Black Death chilled her to the bone.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of her resilience;  the vastness of the land stretched before her, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter,' the swirling nebula of Xylos painting vibrant colours across her viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the risks were ever-present – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormhole activity, and the unsettling vastness of space itself.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery, of encountering alien civilizations and charting unmapped stars, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
