
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the stench of decay from a nearby village ravaged by plague. Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – demanded she traverse the perilous Blackwood Forest, a realm of shadowy bandits and mythical beasts.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the thought of the King's fate spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare isotope from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson light of its dying sun.  The jump to hyperspace was always risky, the unpredictable gravitational forces a constant threat, but the galaxy held riches beyond measure for those brave enough to seek them, and Eva, with her steely gaze and unflinching resolve, was among the bravest.
