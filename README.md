
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Black Forest.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael from the clutches of a shadowy sorcerer.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the distant spire of the sorcerer’s tower fueled his resolve, a beacon of hope in the vast, unpredictable wilderness of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship believed to have stumbled upon a new, habitable planet beyond the known galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel, Eva relied on her advanced AI and her equally advanced courage.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and unimaginable danger, a stark contrast to the familiar, albeit perilous, landscapes of Earth's past.
