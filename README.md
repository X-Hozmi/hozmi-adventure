
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s chainmail as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog were reminders of the perilous journey – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease all stood between him and his desperate hope.  The ancient tracks wound through forests teeming with unseen dangers, each bend offering both exhilaration and a knot of fear in his stomach.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas clouds a stark contrast to the cold, hard steel of her ship. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal flickering weakly across the vast expanse of space.  Warp drives hummed, threatening to tear the fabric of spacetime itself as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the aggressive patrol drones of the Kryll Empire.  The galaxy held wonders beyond imagining, but every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a daring leap of faith into the unknown.
