
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the windswept hill, the skeletal remains of a long-dead castle silhouetted against the bruised purple sky.  His quest – to deliver the sacred relic to the besieged city of Aethelburg – had led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over rivers swollen with spring thaw.  Each day brought new peril, from ravenous wolves to cunning highwaymen, testing his courage and his dwindling supplies.  The road ahead remained uncertain, but the glint of hope, fueled by faith and the weight of his responsibility, burned brighter than the setting sun.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast cosmic dust clouds obscured her path, while the ever-present threat of pirate raids kept her crew on high alert.  Warp jumps across uncharted sectors were a gamble, each one potentially leading to a previously unknown system, teeming with life – or deadly radiation. Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a world ravaged by a strange new plague. The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also held dangers far beyond the imagination of any medieval knight.
