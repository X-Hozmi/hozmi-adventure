
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Zerzura, fueled his journey, pushing him relentlessly towards his elusive goal across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the fate of a lost civilization, propelled them through the inky black, across the uncharted expanses of the galaxy.
