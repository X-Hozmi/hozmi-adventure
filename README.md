
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  His journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, hope, and the unwavering determination to reach his goal before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal predators.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva and her crew faced challenges far beyond the medieval traveler's wildest imaginings. Yet, like Thomas before her, she was driven by a profound sense of purpose, her resolve tempered by the vastness and wonder of the cosmos.
