
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small caravan lumbered onward.  Their journey from the bustling port of Marseille to the fabled Silk Road was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for scarce provisions in dusty villages.  Yet, the lure of exotic spices, rich silks, and untold riches kept their weary spirits alight, fueled by the hope of a life beyond the familiar.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route connecting the Andromeda galaxy to the distant Cygnus X-1 system.  The cosmos held infinite wonders, but also unimaginable dangers; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets prowled the inky blackness.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, yet the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and unlocking the secrets of the universe spurred her onward.
