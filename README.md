
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Carpathian Mountains stretching before them.  Their journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, had already claimed several men to bandits, fever, and the sheer brutality of the landscape.  Each rocky pass presented a new challenge; each valley held the whisper of unseen dangers – wild beasts, rival lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their battered pack animals struggled onward, spurred by the hope of reaching the holy city and the promise of untold riches – if they survived the harrowing trek.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, the crimson light painting the bridge in ethereal hues.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory Zydonian cruisers was a daily test of skill and nerve, a far cry from the quaint dangers of medieval travel.  But the lure of galactic exploration, of uncovering the universe's secrets, propelled her forward, a modern-day knight errant on a journey across the cosmos.
