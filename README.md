
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a tattered banner.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the heart of the unforgiving desert.  Bandits, scorching sun, and dwindling supplies were constant companions on her perilous journey, yet the whispers of ancient secrets and untold riches spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each crackle of the parched earth, was a note in the symphony of her daring adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates, Rexx relied on his wits and his trusty crew. The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, both terrified and exhilarated him, the ultimate test of courage and skill in the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
