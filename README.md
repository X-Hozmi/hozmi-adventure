
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the sun-baked track.  Her journey across the vast, untamed lands of Francia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers snaked across her path, and the whispers of plagues stalked the villages she passed. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward – the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, filled with forgotten magic and untold riches, a beacon in the heart of the wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet teeming with hostile lifeforms and guarded by ancient, powerful technology.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the dazzling light of distant stars and the ever-present threat of pirate raids and unforeseen cosmic events, posed a challenge far exceeding any earthly adventure. Yet, the galaxy stretched before him, a canvas of infinite possibilities and daring exploits.
