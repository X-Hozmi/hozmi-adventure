
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He carried a king's ransom in silks and spices, a perilous cargo that promised both immense wealth and certain death if intercepted by bandits or the ever-present threat of disease. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.  The journey from Constantinople to London was a tapestry woven with the threads of breathtaking landscapes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant shadow of uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, unknowable emptiness of space.  Navigation charts, filled with celestial anomalies and potential hazards, were her bible, each jump a gamble against cosmic radiation and the unforeseen dangers lurking in the unexplored corners of the galaxy.  The adventure, though technologically advanced, held the same perilous thrill as Thomas's medieval journey.
