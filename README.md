The air hung heavy with the scent of sweat, leather, and wood smoke, while the rhythmic clatter of hooves and the occasional grunt from the oxen provided a constant, soothing backdrop.

This journey, fraught with danger and uncertainty, held the promise of uncovering the ultimate secret - were they truly alone in this vast universe?
