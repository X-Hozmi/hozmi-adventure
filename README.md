
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague before I set off, a meager purse and a map my only companions.  Ahead lay the perilous journey across the Holy Roman Empire, a tapestry woven with the threats of bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of weather.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes – rolling hills giving way to dark forests, bustling market towns replaced by desolate stretches of road.  Every encounter, every obstacle, sharpened the senses and tested the limits of endurance, forging a resilience born only of the road itself.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a motley bunch bound by ambition and a shared thirst for the unknown, navigated treacherous asteroid fields and skirted the fringes of black holes.  The alien landscapes of Xylos, breathtaking in their otherworldly beauty, offered a stark contrast to the sterile confines of the ship.  The adventure lay not just in the journey's dangers, but in the potential for discovery – a discovery that could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.
