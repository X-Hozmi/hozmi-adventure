
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, trudge across the sun-baked plains of France.  Their journey to the Holy Land is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell unpredictably, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air. Each sunrise brings new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in squalid villages, and relying on the kindness (or begrudging tolerance) of strangers.  Yet, the lure of Jerusalem, a promise whispered on the wind, keeps her pushing onward, fueled by faith and a stubborn spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human colony.  The journey is measured not in days but in light-years, each warp jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids.  The ship's AI, a wryly sarcastic entity named HAL-E, provides company during the lonely stretches between jumps, while Ava and her crew navigate complex astrophysical equations and the even more complex human dynamics within their small, isolated community.  The quest for survival and a new home tests their resilience and bonds in the unforgiving emptiness of space.
