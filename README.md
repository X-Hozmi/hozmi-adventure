
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing his plague-stricken kingdom.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Ys, of shimmering spires beneath the waves, fuel his relentless journey, pushing him onward despite the hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf between galaxies. Her mission: to locate a lost colony, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through nebulae shimmering with impossible colours and dodging asteroid fields that stretch for light years, she relies on cutting-edge technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew. The challenges are cosmic in scale – warp core malfunctions, hostile alien encounters, and the gnawing isolation of deep space – but the hope of finding her lost kin burns brighter than any supernova.
