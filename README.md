
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained the King's urgent missive, a perilous journey to deliver.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her – a constant reminder of the raw, untamed beauty and brutal danger inherent in medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Jax's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields between galaxies was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of interplanetary customs.  His mission: to secure a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking vistas, but also a chilling solitude. The weight of responsibility – the survival of a colony – rested squarely on his shoulders, a burden far heavier than any earthly king's missive.
