He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing a rumored lost city said to hold unimaginable riches.

Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were daily challenges.  But the promise of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, of charting unmapped territories in the star-strewn ocean, fueled her unwavering courage.
