
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He carried a king's pardon, a forged one at that, clutched tight in his hand.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by beasts and brigands, but beyond that, the promise of a new life, a hidden monastery where he hoped to find sanctuary.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fed the thrill and terror of his desperate journey across a land both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated the treacherous asteroid field, a kaleidoscope of cosmic debris shimmering under the light of distant suns.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey across galaxies demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, stretched out before her, an infinite playground of adventure among the stars.
