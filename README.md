
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, patched with scraps of parchment, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Brigid.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge: treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of miraculous healing and forgotten knowledge, fueled her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble on untested hyperspace coordinates provided by a reclusive alien race.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers prowling the void.  But the promise of a new world, rich with unexplored resources and unimaginable wonders, beckoned her onward, a beacon in the endless darkness.
