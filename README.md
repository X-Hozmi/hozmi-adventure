
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, guides his destrier through the dense Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the distant Holy City of Jerusalem, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows, disease stalks the land, and the very terrain itself presents a constant challenge – treacherous rivers to ford, unforgiving mountains to climb.  Each sunrise brings the promise of both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a daily gamble against the odds.  His only companions are his loyal squire and the unwavering hope that fuels his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a previously unexplored sector of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and encompassing the unimaginable vastness of space.  Advanced technology protects them from the dangers of radiation and micrometeoroids, yet the unknown remains a constant threat.  Uncharted celestial bodies, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure make every jump through hyperspace a heart-stopping gamble.  The cosmos, while awe-inspiring, is a ruthless mistress, demanding respect and rewarding only the boldest of explorers.
