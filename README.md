
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the summer heat, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort of his horse, marked another step toward the unknown, a journey fraught with bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the hope of salvation spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Cosmic radiation crackled around her ship, a constant reminder of the vastness and unforgiving nature of space.  Each jump through hyperspace, each avoided asteroid field, was a gamble, a testament to her courage and unwavering dedication to finding a solution, no matter the galactic odds.
