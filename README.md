
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the biting wind threatened to freeze her to the bone.  But the promise of the legendary Sunstone, a relic said to heal the plague ravaging her village, fueled her onward. Each creaking step, each gasping breath, was a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the jump to the Xylos system always held a thrill, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Her mission: to secure a rare element vital to sustaining life on her overcrowded home planet. The vastness of space, a thrilling and terrifying expanse, held both the promise of salvation and the ever-present threat of unknown dangers.
