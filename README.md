
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Andalusia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant kingdom of Aragon.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  Yet, the glint of distant mountains fueled her weary steps, promising solace and perhaps, salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light-years and through uncharted star systems.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system failures was a daily struggle.  But the thought of those colonists, stranded and alone, spurred her on, making the cold, impersonal vastness of space feel, for a moment, like home.
