
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps, rumored to be haunted by brigands and snow devils.  Our meager caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries,  creaked onward, the rhythmic thud of hooves and the creak of wagon wheels our constant companions.  Each mountain pass was a victory, each valley a gamble, as we navigated treacherous paths and bartered for scarce provisions in isolated villages, the ever-present threat of bandits and the unpredictable weather our constant foes.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrates through the bones of the 'Stardust Drifter', a battered freighter navigating the treacherous currents of the Cygnus X-1 nebula.  Our cargo:  rare Xylos crystals, worth a king's ransom.  Between nebulae, the void is a suffocating black, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of galaxies and the occasional rogue asteroid.  The constant threat of pirate raiders and navigational anomalies keeps us alert, every jump a roll of the cosmic dice, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The vast emptiness is both terrifying and awe-inspiring, a stark reminder of humanity's insignificance yet boundless potential.
