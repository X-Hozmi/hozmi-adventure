
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, with every sunrise, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by the desperate hope for her brother's life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony struggling against a hostile environment.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, but the dangers remained ever-present – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships preying on slower vessels.  The vastness of the cosmos was both exhilarating and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the infinite expanse.
