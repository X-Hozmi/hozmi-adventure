
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zaragoza, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for bandit ambush or the promise of a hidden oasis.  The journey was brutal, a test of endurance against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of the unknown, but the lure of adventure, a siren song in the wind, kept her pushing onward.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast, swirling nebulas painted the viewport in cosmic hues, while the hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit.  Her mission: to chart unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unstable wormholes, aggressive space pirates, and the ever-present threat of encountering alien civilizations, some benevolent, others far less so.  The cosmos offered a different kind of hardship than Elara's, but the same exhilarating rush of discovery fueled her every jump into the inky black.
