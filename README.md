Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a place of both untold riches and perilous magic.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and mythical beasts roamed the untamed forests, but the lure of the unknown propelled him ever forward, his heart pounding a rhythm of excitement against his ribs.
