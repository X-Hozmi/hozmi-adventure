
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rocky scramble, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements.  This journey, fraught with peril, held the promise of a future far brighter than the bleak existence she left behind.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the control panel, the tremor echoing through the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Navigating the chaotic nebula of Xylos was testing even his seasoned skills;  the gravitational pull of rogue planets threatened to rip his starship apart.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals across the Andromeda galaxy. The vastness of space was a daunting expanse, riddled with asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes. But for Rexx, the challenge was a siren's call – the thrill of galactic exploration burned bright within him.
