
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for a deadly plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of hope in their eyes, fueled by the desperate pleas of their people, spurred them onwards, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a miraculous cure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world thought swallowed by a rogue black hole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unseen celestial bodies was commonplace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on them, a stark contrast to the cozy confines of their ship.  Yet, the faint signal, a beacon of hope in the cosmic darkness, kept their hearts alight, fueling their tireless search for lost kin across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
