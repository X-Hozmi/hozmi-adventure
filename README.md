
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights crested the hill, their worn surcoats flapping in the harsh wind. Before them stretched the endless, unforgiving expanse of the Saxon wilderness, a tapestry woven with treacherous bogs, dense forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts. Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the only cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each mile was a battle against the elements and desperate men, a test of endurance and courage that defined their very existence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light-years from her homeworld.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, tested not only her piloting skills but also her resolve.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, offered a freedom that dwarfed even the wildest medieval dreams, but demanded a precision and courage beyond compare.
