
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel holding all she possessed.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and terrifying dangers.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainty of her quest.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offered a fleeting comfort before the endless expanse swallowed it whole again.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant colours painted across the void hid treacherous asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored planets.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a power source rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across light years, she raced against rival explorers and the ever-present threat of pirates, the cold vacuum of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
