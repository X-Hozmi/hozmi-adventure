
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death already stalked the land, a shadow clinging to the edges of her journey.  Her meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, but the hope in her heart, fueled by fierce sisterly love, burned brighter than any torch.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gases, the swirling colours mirroring the kaleidoscope of emotions within her.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-jump failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes was child's play compared to the political machinations and alien encounters she faced. The fate of Xylos, and perhaps the fragile peace between civilizations, rested on her shoulders, a weight as vast and unknowable as the cosmos itself.
