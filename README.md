
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the vast unknown.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each startled bird, was a potential threat, but the whispered tales of the lost city of Eldoria, with its fabled treasures, spurred her onward. The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust mirroring the sunset she'd once imagined in her ancestor's tales. Instead of bandits, she faced the silent threat of void storms and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations. Though the journey between galaxies was measured in lightyears, not days, the lure of uncovering new worlds and ancient secrets remained a powerful, echoing force, a timeless human drive towards the unexplored.
