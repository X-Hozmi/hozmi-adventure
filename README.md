Sir Kaelan, his armor dulled by dust and sun, squinted at the horizon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the fabled Sunstone, said to hold the key to ending the kingdom's drought, spurred him onward, a beacon in the endless expanse of medieval Europe.  He pushed his weary horse further, spurred by the promise of glory and the desperate hope of saving his people.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.

The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the audacious nature of her quest.
