
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward.  Their journey across the unforgiving Breton countryside was a tapestry woven with hardship:  rain-soaked nights huddled around dwindling fires, skirmishes with bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fueled their weary steps.  Each sunrise brought the promise of discovery, a counterpoint to the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut a silent path through the nebula of Xylos, its sensors scanning for habitable planets amongst the swirling cosmic dust.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering other, perhaps hostile, civilizations. The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the risks.
