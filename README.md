
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained her family's hope – a rumored healer in a distant monastery, capable of curing her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, marked a step closer to either salvation or despair, a constant gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  The adventure was a desperate one, etched with the harsh beauty of a world both cruel and magnificent.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Janson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of crimson and emerald gas clouds. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from her home in the Sol system.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, held its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vastness of space offered a thrilling, terrifying freedom, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a gamble not just for survival, but for the future of humanity itself.
