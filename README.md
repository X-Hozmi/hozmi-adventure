
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and into the shadow of ancient, whispering forests.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in the shadows, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the unwavering faith in their destination spurred them onward, a testament to the enduring human spirit's capacity for adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves beckoned.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the kaleidoscopic colours shifted and danced around them. This wasn't a pilgrimage; it was a scientific expedition to chart a newly discovered galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space still held a primal terror and wonder.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue plasma bursts, and facing the unknown alien lifeforms that inhabited this remote corner of the cosmos, brought a different kind of peril, but the same spirit of courageous exploration that had driven Thomas centuries before fueled Eva's journey among the stars.
