
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Reginald, his chainmail heavy beneath his worn surcoat, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous voyage across the Andromeda galaxy to retrieve a vital component for the interdimensional transponder.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of uncharted systems was all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent, tested the limits of her ship and her crew, their courage a beacon against the infinite darkness.
