
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies – it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease that plagued the land.  Survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black of intergalactic space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos held both breathtaking wonder and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single ship in the face of the universe's infinite expanse.
