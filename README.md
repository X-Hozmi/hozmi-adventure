
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with salted meat and questionable bread, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small price to pay for the glory that awaited, a glory that whispered promises on the wind and beckoned him further into the unknown heart of the desert.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The journey, a year-long odyssey through the vast emptiness between stars, was fraught with its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  But Eva, fueled by a fierce determination and the hope of a better future, steered her ship through the cosmic sea, charting a course towards a new dawn for humankind.
