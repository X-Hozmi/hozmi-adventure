
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains offered little comfort, yet the promise of the fabled city of Saragossa, and the rumored lost scrolls within its library, fueled her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant dance between fear and exhilaration on her perilous journey across medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate habitable planets for humanity's expanding civilization.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae and the cold, hard light of distant suns, presented a different kind of hardship than Elara faced.  But the same spirit of adventure burned within Eva, the yearning to push boundaries, to uncover the unknown, to chart a course through the unmapped territories of the cosmos, a journey far more grand, but echoing the same fundamental human desire for exploration.
