
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog from a distant village, each rustle in the tall grass, felt like a potential threat in this lawless land, but the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward, across treacherous mountains and through shadowed forests, embracing the perils of a medieval journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the kaleidoscopic colors a stark contrast to the cold steel of her cockpit. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of becoming habitable.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and enduring the endless expanse of interstellar space were routine hazards, but the weight of her responsibility – the potential for a new human colony – fueled her journey across the vast, uncharted territories of the galaxy.
