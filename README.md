
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary steed as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the relentless sun beat down on her parched throat.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through her. Yet, the thought of the people she was striving to reach fueled her onward, a flicker of hope in the vast, uncertain expanse before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, plotting a course through nebulae and asteroid fields.  The vastness of space held a different kind of terror than Elara's journey - the silent, infinite expanse threatened to swallow her whole.  But the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a new hope for humanity, outweighed the fear, driving her forward towards the uncharted regions of the cosmos.
