
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of exotic spices and shimmering silks from the East.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine said to heal the plague-ravaged lands, was a perilous gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Every sunrise brought new challenges, every sunset the quiet fear of never reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula shimmering with impossible colours.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy had already tested the ship and crew to their limits – gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates prowling the void.  But the promise of unlocking the secrets of the universe, the chance to finally bridge the vast distances separating humankind from the stars, fueled their unwavering determination.
