
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatening to send man and beast tumbling into oblivion, and the constant gnawing hunger that tested their resolve.  Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of Jerusalem, the whispered promises of salvation and glory, fueled their weary steps forward.  The adventure was brutal, unforgiving, but richly rewarding in the shared experiences and the stories that would be told around countless campfires for years to come.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids threatening to tear through their shields, the crushing loneliness of interstellar space, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters. But the promise of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of the cosmos, propelled her onward.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble with the vast, awe-inspiring universe itself.
