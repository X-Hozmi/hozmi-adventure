
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining with the weight of his pack, squinted at the setting sun.  Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto his face, mirroring the craggy landscape of the Pyrenees he traversed.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred him onward. The thrill of discovery, the chance to etch his name into legend, outweighed the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the vast, terrifying emptiness of space, yet Eva felt a kinship with the countless stars surrounding her. This wasn't just a mission; it was humanity's reaching towards the unknown, a new chapter in the galactic saga. The risks were immense – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, the unknown nature of the planet itself – but the promise of finding life beyond Earth fueled her determination.
