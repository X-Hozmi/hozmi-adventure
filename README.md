
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of the desert oasis, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to press on.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all in a day's work for Elara and her crew.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of discovery, and the thought of finding the lost colonists spurred them onward, a beacon in the infinite darkness.
