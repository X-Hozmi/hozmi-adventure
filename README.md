
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the whispering woods, offered little comfort.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place spoken of in hushed tones – a city of gold and untold magic, but also guarded by monstrous beasts and treacherous terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a constant reminder of the peril and the exhilarating promise of adventure that lay just beyond the next bend in the path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and swirling gas clouds visible through the viewport.  While lacking the immediate physical danger of Kaelan's journey, Eva's voyage held a different kind of suspense – the unknown possibilities of a new world, the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel, and the constant threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vastness of space.
