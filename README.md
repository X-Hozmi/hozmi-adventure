
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred by rumors of a lost city brimming with gold and ancient secrets, trudged through the muddy mire of a late autumnal forest.  Each step was a battle against the clinging mud, the biting wind, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume us.  We navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded icy rivers, and evaded the suspicious glares of bandits lurking in the shadows, all for a chance to uncover the fabled El Dorado of the north.  The journey itself, fraught with peril and hardship, was as much an adventure as the treasure we sought.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cut through the inky blackness of the void, its course charted towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and dealing with malfunctioning hyperdrives became our daily bread.  The vast, breathtaking expanse of space, peppered with nebulae of unimaginable beauty and the cold, hard reality of survival, created an adventure unlike any other.
