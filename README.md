
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of discovery – a forgotten Roman ruin, a bustling bazaar teeming with exotic goods and whispered rumors, or the chilling sight of a hawk circling above, a potential omen of bandits lurking nearby.  The journey is arduous, fraught with peril from both nature and man, but the allure of the faraway spice markets of Samarkand keeps our weary feet moving.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, obsidian hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cuts through the inky blackness of interstellar space, charting a course towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a diverse band of xeno-linguists, navigators, and engineers, face the ever-present threat of nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the chilling emptiness of the void. Yet, the promise of untold discoveries and the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders fuels our relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
