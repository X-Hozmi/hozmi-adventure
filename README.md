
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s warhorse as he urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack, fueling the adrenaline that kept him pushing through exhaustion and fear.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and terrifying, tested his resolve with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver splinter against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to establish contact with the Xylos civilization on the far side of the nebula, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to survive.  The sheer scale of the cosmos, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns, dwarfed even the most daunting earthly landscapes, filling her with a sense of awe and the profound loneliness of interstellar travel.
