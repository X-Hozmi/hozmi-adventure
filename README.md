
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance at the darkening forest, fueled the thrill of her perilous journey.  Bandits, treacherous paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than the potential failure of her mission.  This was not simply travel; it was a desperate gambit against the encroaching shadow of the Black Death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the blinking lights of the ship's console, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The journey was fraught with dangers – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms – but the promise of discovery fueled her determination.  This was not just interstellar travel; it was the vanguard of humanity's expansion into the cosmos.
