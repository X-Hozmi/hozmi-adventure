Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every mile.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of Jerusalem, the whispered legends of its sacred sites, and the promise of adventure fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unpredictable tapestry of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her cockpit.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold a key to faster-than-light travel.  While the dangers were different – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remained the same; a relentless push against the unknown, fueled by curiosity, courage, and the limitless expanse of the cosmos.
