
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death are less frightening than the unknown that lies ahead – a mythical city rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each flash of a hawk circling overhead, is a heartbeat in a perilous symphony, a testament to the raw, unforgiving beauty and danger of medieval travel.  The road is long, the challenges immense, but the hope for healing fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Navigating by the faint shimmer of quasars, she charts a course through unmapped nebulae toward Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse around them.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and unpredictable wormholes – the thrill of the unknown, the allure of discovery, remain the same timeless motivators that spurred Elara's journey across the medieval world.
