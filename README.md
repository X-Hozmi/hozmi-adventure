
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it represented, spurred them relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet clinging precariously to life on the edge of explored space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and wrestling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work.  Yet, the vastness of the cosmos, the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes glimpsed through her viewport, and the knowledge that she was a vital lifeline to a struggling colony, fueled her unwavering resolve to reach her destination.
