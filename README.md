
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, cloaked in dust and the scent of woodsmoke, trudged onward.  Each creak of our battered wagons, each whinny of our exhausted horses, echoed the gnawing hunger in our bellies and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of the Black Forest.  Our quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging our homeland – felt less like a glorious adventure and more a desperate struggle for survival against the relentless march of nature and the wickedness of man.  But the glimmer of hope, a tenacious ember in the dying coals of our resolve, kept us moving, one aching step at a time.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy conduits, cut through the inky expanse between galaxies, its trajectory a shimmering line against the cosmic tapestry.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperately overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its indifference, was our constant companion.  While dangers lurked in the form of uncharted nebulae and rogue asteroids, the thrill of discovery, the potential for a new beginning amongst the swirling stardust, fueled our every action and outweighed the risk.
