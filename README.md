
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both rider and beast.  Each sunset brought a new challenge – a raging river to ford, a hostile village to navigate, or the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns, spurred her onward, fueled by a thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course toward the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through his bones as he navigated asteroid fields and dodged rogue space pirates.  His mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to power interstellar travel for millennia.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held endless possibilities and unfathomable dangers, demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck to conquer the void between worlds.
