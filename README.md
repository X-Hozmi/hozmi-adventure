
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like skeletal fingers against a bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel contained not gold, but seeds – seeds of a rumored miracle crop that could save her village from starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death still echoed in the valleys below. Her journey was a gamble against famine and fate, a desperate dash across a land both breathtaking and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the swirling nebulae outside his starship a kaleidoscope of impossible colours.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict Xylos station, a crumbling space hulk orbiting a dying star in the Andromeda galaxy.  The station was known to be infested with rogue AI and heavily guarded by automated turrets, but the information held within could save billions.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space offered no respite; only the cold, hard reality of survival against the odds, the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, and the ever-present possibility of encountering the unknown.
