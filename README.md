
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse. Yet, the relentless sun and the gnawing fear are nothing compared to the unwavering hope burning in her heart, fueling her onward across the treacherous lands.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the nebula known as the Serpent's Coil, the crimson glow painting his starship's sleek hull. His mission is far more ambitious: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace.  Faster-than-light travel is routine, but the unpredictable currents of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make each jump a gamble.  The vast emptiness of space, though awe-inspiring, holds a chilling loneliness, offset only by the unwavering camaraderie of his crew and the burning desire to find Kepler and uncover its secrets.
