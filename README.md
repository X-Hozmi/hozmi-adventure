
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Jude, felt both impossibly distant and intensely personal.  The whispers of its healing properties were her only compass, guiding her through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving rivers, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, contrasting sharply with the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling past her viewport.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the unwavering determination burned just as brightly in her heart as it had in Elara’s.  The vastness of space held the same allure and peril as the vastness of the medieval world.
