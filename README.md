The rutted track snaked through a sun-drenched valley, the scent of pine and damp earth heavy in the air. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost scriptures of King Arthur.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all obstacles on his perilous journey across the kingdom, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  He carried with him not only a sword but the hope of a lifetime, fuelled by legends and the promise of discovery.

Captain Eva Rostova navigated by the light of distant quasars, her course charted to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar communication.  Years of training and countless jumps through hyperspace had prepared her for the challenges – gravitational anomalies, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the lonely vastness of space itself.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of contact with a new civilization, kept her engines humming, driving her ever forward.
