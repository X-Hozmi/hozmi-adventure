
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Saint Eadwine, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits had shadowed their small caravan, storms had battered their meager supplies, and the endless expanse of unforgiving land tested their endurance daily.  Yet, the whispered tales of miraculous cures and the unwavering hope in her heart spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of another step closer to her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the kaleidoscopic beauty.  The intergalactic trade run was risky; pirate factions lurked in the shadowed sectors, and unpredictable spacetime anomalies threatened to swallow whole ships.  But the thrill of charting unknown systems, the promise of exotic goods from distant worlds, and the camaraderie of her crew made the dangers worthwhile.  For Nova, the vastness of space was not empty, but a canvas teeming with adventure, every jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
