
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his weary steed onward. The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as he navigated the treacherous, rutted track through the Black Forest.  Each shadow held the potential for banditry, and every whispered rumour spoke of mythical beasts guarding hidden passes. His quest – to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude and retrieve a sacred relic – demanded courage, cunning, and a resilience forged in the fires of countless hardships.  The journey was as much a test of spirit as it was of endurance.


A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted across the viewport were breathtaking, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines. Her mission: a daring expedition to Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond anything humanity had achieved.  Navigating asteroid fields and contending with unpredictable gravitational forces were child's play compared to the political machinations and rival factions vying for control of this potential new frontier. The vastness of space held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva was ready to embrace it all.
