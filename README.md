
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the Whispering Mountains, a legendary range said to hold both untold riches and perilous beasts.  Her worn map, a family heirloom, promised a shortcut to the bustling port city of  Aquilonia, a gamble for a young woman seeking passage to the faraway lands whispered about in tavern tales. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant lullaby against the vast emptiness of space.  Their mission: to retrieve a rare mineral from the planet Xylos IV, a world shrouded in legend and rumored to be guarded by sentient crystalline lifeforms.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own unique brand of adventure, a far cry from the dusty trails of a medieval journey, but equally fraught with danger and the thrill of the unknown.
