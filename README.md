
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, spurred his weary steed onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new trials – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis in a sea of despair, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble to secure a vital resource for a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders was child's play compared to the psychological toll of interstellar travel – the crushing loneliness, the gnawing fear of the unknown, and the constant hum of the ship's engines a stark reminder of her distance from everything she held dear.  But the potential reward – the salvation of her people – kept her engines burning bright.
