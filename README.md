
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as her weary mare picks its way across the parched landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a treacherous passage to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the desert itself are constant companions on this perilous journey, but the promise of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown spur her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the scrub, holds the potential for both terror and exhilaration.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust Drifter* breaches the nebula, its hyperdrive still humming faintly.  The breathtaking vista of the Andromeda galaxy spreads before them, a kaleidoscope of swirling colours and distant suns.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  But the vastness of space holds dangers unseen – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  Yet, the allure of discovery and the hope of a new dawn for humankind propel them forward, into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
