
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous trek across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a gamble against the odds.  The whispers of Zerzura’s riches and magical artifacts fuelled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain wilderness.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to harbor advanced alien civilizations.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was child's play compared to the diplomatic challenges that awaited.  The vast expanse of space held both wonder and danger, the potential for discovery balanced precariously against the threat of unknown, possibly hostile, encounters. Every jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on the vast, unforgiving canvas of the cosmos.
