The dusty track wound through a seemingly endless landscape of rolling hills and sun-baked plains, the only company the rhythmic clop of hooves and the chirping of unseen insects.  He carried with him a king's ransom in silks and spices, but the real treasure was the adventure itself – the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of his small band, and the constant threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of war lurking just beyond the horizon. Each sunset brought a new challenge, each sunrise a new hope as they pressed ever closer to their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the occasional crackle of static from the comms system.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the cramped confines of her ship.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates – but the promise of discovery, of charting unknown worlds and possibly encountering other life, fueled her unwavering determination.
