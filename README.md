Weeks of relentless travel across the blistered plains had taken their toll, but the thrill of the unknown spurred him onward.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts, had drawn him from his ancestral lands, a siren song promising glory and untold riches.

The thrill of discovery, the ever-present danger of warp storms and alien encounters, fuelled her insatiable thirst for the unexplored expanse of the cosmos.
