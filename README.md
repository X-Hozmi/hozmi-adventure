
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Aquitaine, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested the limits of man and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the allure of adventure, the glint of glory, spurred him onwards.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the elusive Kryll civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-vigilant patrols of the Zydonian Empire demanded precision and courage. The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, pressed in on her.  But the possibility of first contact, the chance to uncover new knowledge and expand humanity's reach, fueled her drive to overcome unimaginable odds.
