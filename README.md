
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack mules and weary men, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We were bound for Constantinople, carrying silks and spices – fortunes and perhaps fates –  along a route riddled with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of breathtaking landscapes, from snow-capped mountains to whispering forests, but also the chilling uncertainty of what lurked beyond the next dune.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway. The *Stardust Wanderer*, a vessel that defied the very laws of physics, cut a shimmering path through the nebula of Xylos.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expansion.  The vast emptiness between stars held a beauty and terror equally profound, the thrill of discovery balanced by the ever-present danger of uncharted space anomalies and the silent, alien landscapes that awaited us on distant worlds.
