
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the whispers of a plague sweeping the east added to the growing unease. Yet, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, each creak of her saddle a testament to the miles conquered, each hardship a step closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been treacherous, pushing her vessel to its limits, but the potential rewards – a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – were too tempting to ignore.  The vastness of space was a constant reminder of her isolation, yet the thrill of exploration, the uncharted territories shimmering before her, fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination and rewrite the history of interstellar travel.
