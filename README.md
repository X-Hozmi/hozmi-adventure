
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised autumn sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a prickling fear – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in a tavern tale. Yet, the urgency of her mission spurred her onward, the promise of a king's gratitude a distant, yet powerful, beacon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae, avoiding asteroid fields that dwarfed entire planets, and communicating across unimaginable distances were daily challenges.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a flicker of hope in the vast, indifferent cosmos.  The loneliness of space was a constant companion, but the thought of bringing aid, of reuniting families scattered across light years, fueled her resolve and pushed her further into the unknown.
