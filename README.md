
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's urgent missive, a perilous journey to deliver across treacherous mountain passes and through bandit-infested forests.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, or disaster.  The whispers of ancient ruins and forgotten legends fuelled her onward, a lone woman against the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting through the cosmic dust.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable gravity wells, and the lurking threats of alien lifeforms made every jump through hyperspace a gamble.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration beyond the known galaxy, kept her engines humming, pushing the boundaries of human reach.
