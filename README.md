
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his mount onward. The sun beat down on the dusty track leading through the unforgiving French countryside, a stark contrast to the lush meadows promised in his destination.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the lingering spectre of the Black Death, sweeping through the land like a merciless tide.  His quest: to retrieve a stolen relic, a journey filled with peril, intrigue, and the hope of returning a hero to his kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues painted across her viewport offered a breathtaking distraction from the perilous warp jump ahead, a jump that could send her ship hurtling through space-time itself or, worse, into the clutches of the Kryll pirates who patrolled these desolate sectors. Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a journey demanding not only skill but courage in the face of unimaginable cosmic dangers and vast, uncharted territories.
