
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing all she owned.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasted meat from distant villages mingled with the earthy aroma of the parched land.  Her journey to the fabled city of Granada, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the lure of adventure, whispered on the wind and shared in hushed tavern tales, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of space, its trajectory set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigation was a delicate dance of astrogation and hyperspace jumps, each one a gamble against unknown gravitational anomalies and hostile pirate fleets.  The crew, a motley bunch of explorers and mercenaries, clung to camaraderie and shared dreams of discovering new worlds, civilizations, and technologies beyond human comprehension.  The vastness of space offered unimaginable opportunities, but also held the potential for utter annihilation.
