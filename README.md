
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Robbers, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of disease were minor inconveniences compared to the whispers that followed her – whispers of a power hidden in Ys, a power that could change the fate of kingdoms.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold reward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a journey fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Warp drives hummed, battling gravitational pulls and the unpredictable whims of cosmic currents.  Pirate raiders, sentient asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were just a few of the hazards threatening the crew and their precious cargo.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, held the same allure of untold riches and discovery as the medieval landscape did before.
