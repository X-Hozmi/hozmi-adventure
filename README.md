
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his chainmail heavy beneath his worn surcoat, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested his courage and resilience. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the lingering fear of never reaching his destination, a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval overland travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers in battered freighters, and battling unpredictable temporal distortions were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, and the ever-present risk of catastrophic failure made interstellar travel a high-stakes gamble, a far cry from the comparatively confined dangers of medieval journeys.
