
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The biting wind whipped across the bleak, snow-dusted plains, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of a forgotten god.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the frozen grass, fueled the growing tension—bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving elements all posed constant threats on this perilous journey across the heart of a land shrouded in mystery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vast, terrifying beauty of interstellar space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was a daily occurrence, but the thrill of discovery—of charting unknown territories and encountering alien civilizations—outweighed the dangers.  The cosmos was her canvas, and the endless journey, her masterpiece.
