
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a lost monastery rumored to hold ancient knowledge.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered tales of both wonder and peril – bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe.  Her spirit, however, remained unbroken, fueled by the promise of discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the celestial map etched onto her ancestor's ancient wrist-comp.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to harbor sentient life.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, yet the dangers remained – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vast, inky blackness of space mirrored the immensity of her quest, a journey not just across lightyears, but into the uncharted territories of the unknown.
