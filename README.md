
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail was treacherous, a barely-there path winding through the Ardennes forest.  Robbers, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his quest to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by piety and a desperate need to escape a broken heart.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or death.  The vastness of the land itself, a canvas of rolling hills and dark forests, was as much a challenge as any human foe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The risks were cosmic in scale – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life.  Yet, the vast emptiness of space, speckled with the brilliance of distant suns, held a captivating allure. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble on the edge of infinity, promising discovery and danger in equal measure.
