
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zaragoza, a shimmering jewel on the map promising sanctuary and perhaps, a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of hawk overhead, was a reminder of the dangers that lurked – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the unwavering gleam in her eyes spoke of a determination forged in hardship and fueled by love.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the colossal starship *Stardust* shuddering as it jumped across the void between galaxies. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a world swallowed by the nebula.  The cosmic expanse held breathtaking beauty – swirling nebulae and constellations unseen by human eyes – but also the chilling vastness of space.  Alien encounters, engine failures, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel were constant companions, yet Rexx held fast to his purpose, driven by a hope as tenacious as Elara's, a hope to find life where others had only found oblivion.
