
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for a monastery ravaged by famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry or worse.  She pressed onward, driven by faith and a stubborn resilience, her journey a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, breathtaking vistas, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, mirroring the perilous journeys of countless others across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Sparrow' Vance navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The shimmering gas clouds hid untold dangers, from rogue asteroids to the predatory Xylos Krakens. Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos, a journey mirroring the intrepid explorations of early medieval travelers, but on a scale unimaginable to them.
