
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley collection of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-caked tracks of France.  Each dawn brought the chilling bite of autumn air and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Our quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the Pope in Rome, was fraught with peril:  we dodged marauding soldiers, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and bargained with suspicious merchants in bustling, disease-ridden towns. The journey tested our courage, our loyalty, and the very limits of our endurance.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast emptiness between galaxies, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravity wells of rogue planets.  Her crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists, engineers, and explorers, faced unimaginable challenges:  uncharted nebulae shimmered with unknown dangers, while alien lifeforms, both beautiful and terrifying, populated the unmapped sectors of space. Their mission, to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, was a gamble on the very edge of human existence.
