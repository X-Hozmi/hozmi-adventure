
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead, the Spine of the World mountains loomed, a jagged silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  My journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the whispers of wild beasts echoed through the forests. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of facing hardship, fueled my steps. Each sunrise brought new challenges, new landscapes, and the unwavering promise of adventure.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Beyond the viewport, swirling nebulae painted an ethereal canvas across the infinite black. My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel. This wasn't a pilgrimage, but a scientific expedition, the risks as tangible as the radiation shielding around our vessel.  The alien landscapes awaiting us held the potential for breathtaking discovery, but also for unimaginable dangers. The universe was vast, mysterious, and utterly unforgiving, but the allure of the unknown, the insatiable human thirst for exploration, propelled us ever onward.
