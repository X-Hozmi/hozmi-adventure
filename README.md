
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Robbers, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unknown lands.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear that Zerzura might be nothing more than a shimmering mirage.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and contending with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were commonplace hazards.  But the lure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering a new civilization, spurred Elara and her crew onward through the inky blackness, their ship a tiny spark against the overwhelming grandeur of the cosmos.
