
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights pressed onward. Their quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a legendary artifact said to hold the power of a thousand suns.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the rhythmic thud of hooves on cobblestones, the creak of saddle leather, and the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in their bellies.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the glimmer of hope, fueled by legend and the promise of glory, kept them moving.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a tapestry woven with the hum of warp drives, the crackle of subspace communications, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and hostile alien patrols, stretched longer than any earthly voyage.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, and the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies kept the crew focused on their daunting, breathtaking mission.
