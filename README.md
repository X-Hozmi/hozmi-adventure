
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest – to find the lost monastery of Saint Fiacre – led her through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers, and into the shadowed depths of ancient forests.  Each day brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the glint of hope, fueled by whispered legends and ancient maps, kept her spirit alight.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Mallory piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failures.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a cosmic ocean where the smallest mistake could mean oblivion. Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to push humanity's boundaries, propelled him onwards.
