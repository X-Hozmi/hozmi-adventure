Her worn leather satchel holds little besides dried bread and a chipped map, its faded ink barely visible.  She's bound for Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by grief and a desperate hope for solace.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are but minor inconveniences compared to the sorrow that drives her onward, each day a chapter in her perilous, yet strangely beautiful, journey across medieval Europe.

She navigated asteroid fields, battled space pirates, and repaired vital systems while gazing at the breathtaking spectacle of a thousand glittering stars, a constant reminder of the immense, beautiful, and terrifying vastness of the universe.
