
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a place of unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Bandit patrols, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges facing him on this perilous quest, a journey dictated by a thirst for both fortune and the unknown. Each sunrise brought a new peril, each sunset a small victory in this epic struggle across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and maintaining the ship's fragile life support system against the ravages of interstellar space were just a few of the countless dangers she faced.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the cold brilliance of distant stars, held its own terrors, a stark contrast to the more grounded dangers of Thomas' medieval journey, yet both were driven by the same powerful human impulse: the irresistible lure of exploration.
