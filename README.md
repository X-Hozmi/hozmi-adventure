
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she crests the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  Her journey across the vast, unforgiving plains of Francia has been arduous, fraught with bandits, storms, and the gnawing hunger that never truly leaves.  Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, a place of unimaginable wealth and wonder, keeps her weary legs moving. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope for the legendary treasures awaiting her.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and rain, is her only guide.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and risking untold dangers, including the unpredictable spatial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her crew, a motley bunch of seasoned explorers and brilliant scientists, are her only companions in the fathomless expanse of space, bound together by the shared thrill of exploration and the chilling reality of their perilous undertaking.
