
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his mettle, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked him and his dwindling retinue.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure, yet the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of his ambition, propelled him forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite canvas of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue black holes, and enduring the crushing loneliness of deep space were all just part of the voyage.  The vastness of the cosmos dwarfed her vessel, yet the unwavering hope of finding her lost brethren, and unlocking the secrets of the universe, ignited her spirit and drove her onward, a tiny flame against the cold, impenetrable dark.
