
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of decaying vegetation.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease lay ahead, but the hope of salvation spurred him across the unforgiving landscape, each day a gamble against the elements and the brutality of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets potentially harboring life.  The vast distances were nothing compared to the unknown dangers lurking in the unexplored regions of space – rogue asteroids, hostile alien species, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure. Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to expand humanity’s reach, pushed her and her crew further into the cosmic abyss, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the boundless expanse of the galaxy.
