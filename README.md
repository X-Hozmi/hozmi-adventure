
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, inches across the sun-baked plains towards the rumored city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura's fabled riches and lost knowledge fuel our onward journey, pushing us beyond the limits of exhaustion and fear.  The vastness of the unknown, both terrifying and exhilarating, is our constant companion.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Starseeker*, a vessel capable of folding space, carries me across the Milky Way to Kepler-186f, a planet promising verdant landscapes and the possibility of alien life.  The journey is less arduous physically, more a mental marathon of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present hum of the Alcubierre drive.  The thrill, though, is different: the vast scale of the cosmos, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae swirling past our viewport, and the utter loneliness of traversing the infinite gulf between worlds – a loneliness that dwarfs even the desert's emptiness.
