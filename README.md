
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  The sun beats down mercilessly, baking the earth to a near-unbearable temperature.  Each day brings its own perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the spice markets of Samarkand, the whispered legends of forgotten cities, and the sheer thrill of the unknown propel us onward, our determination as stubborn as the mules that carry our burdens.


Conversely, centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways. The *Starseeker*, a vessel capable of traversing light-years in mere weeks, cuts through the inky black between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faint whispers of quasars, her crew a diverse band united by their insatiable curiosity.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers are different—uncharted gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the potential for encountering unknown alien civilizations—but the spirit of adventure, the irresistible pull of the unknown, remains a constant across the epochs.
