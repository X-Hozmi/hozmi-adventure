
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the treacherous Black Forest loomed, a tapestry of shadow and rumour.  He carried a king's ransom, not in gold, but in a fragile scroll containing the secret to a lost monastery, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a testament to the raw, untamed adventure of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold scientific riches and possibly, life beyond Earth.  The journey was a symphony of starlight and sub-light speeds, punctuated by the crackle of the comms and the hum of the hyperdrive.  Facing cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present unknown, Eva led her crew into the vast, unforgiving expanse, an adventure on a scale dwarfing even the wildest medieval dreams.
