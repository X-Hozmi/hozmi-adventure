
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the vast unknown.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse, a perilous journey to reach her ailing brother in the distant kingdom of Aquitaine.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the tension of her solitary adventure, a test of courage and resilience against the unforgiving medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable planet light-years from her homeworld.  The journey had already spanned decades, a tapestry woven with the hum of the hyperdrive and the camaraderie of her diverse crew.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery amongst the unknown wonders of the galaxy, far outweighed the risks of traversing the treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  The future beckoned, a limitless frontier awaiting their arrival.
