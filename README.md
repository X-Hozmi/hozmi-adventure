
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down relentlessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the smell of parched earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each labored breath of his horse, represented another step closer to either salvation or a grave beneath a foreign sky, his fate hanging on the fickle kindness of the road and the malice of brigands lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby masking the immense distances and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers, shared a common dream: to chart the uncharted regions of the galaxy, to uncover the secrets of the cosmos, and to bring back knowledge that could reshape the future of humanity. The journey, however, was fraught with perils far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.
