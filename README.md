
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in his gauntlet.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city whispered to lie beyond the Serpent's Tooth mountains, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to swallow both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of determination, each sunset a grim reminder of the monumental task ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and solar flares; instead of starvation, the constant hum of the ship’s failing life support. The vast emptiness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown alien life forms all fuelled her expedition.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, bringing them closer to a future yet unwritten.
