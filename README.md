
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a worn map – her only companions on this perilous journey to Avignon.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in a tavern tale, but the promise of a new life fueled her weary steps, each mile a victory against the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, held dangers far exceeding any earthly threat.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of engine failure were just some of the challenges she faced, but the possibility of discovering new life and expanding human knowledge propelled her onward, a tiny ship against the infinite backdrop of the universe.
