The King's ransom, a heavy chest strapped to the beast's flank, was his burden – and his only protection against the bandits known to plague the road to Avignon. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a jolt of fear through him, a stark contrast to the thrill of the journey itself. He dreamt of exotic spices and vibrant silks in the faraway city, a reward far outweighing the perils of this arduous, uncertain path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, a nebula of crimson and gold swirling before her.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy was a tapestry woven with the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of space-time. The risk of encountering hostile alien life was ever-present, yet the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets outweighed the danger a thousand times over.
