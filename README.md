
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the battered hooves of Elara's mare as they crested the hill, revealing a vast, sun-baked plain stretching to the horizon.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Her leather jerkin chafed, her water skin nearly empty, but the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of uncovering lost secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and treacherous mountain passes were mere inconveniences compared to the lure of the legendary city.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive resonated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast distances conquered.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien life, the ever-present threat of equipment failure – the same intrepid spirit that drove Elara fueled Eva.  Both women, separated by epochs, shared a common thread: the insatiable hunger for exploration and the courage to face the unknown.
