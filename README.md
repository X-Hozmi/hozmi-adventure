
Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of glory and untold riches fueled his weary limbs, pushing him ever closer to his perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly alien fauna.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and repairing vital systems in the inky blackness of space were all in a day's work.  Yet, the vastness of the cosmos, the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human exploration, filled her with a thrill that surpassed even the most perilous of spacefaring adventures.
