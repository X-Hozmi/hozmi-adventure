Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  The journey had been brutal – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and weeks of meager rations had tested his spirit and his resolve.  But the lure of Eldoria, a beacon in the vast, unknown wilderness, pushed him ever closer, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the dangers of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a meticulously planned interstellar voyage, was far from easy; navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged hyperdrive conduits, and battling bouts of cosmic radiation were everyday occurrences. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for contact with new life forms, far outweighed the risks. The cosmos beckoned, promising adventure on a scale unimaginable to those medieval travelers.
