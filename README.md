
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, said to hold ancient texts, fueled her journey. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a hard-won victory in her quest for knowledge. This was not mere travel; it was a life risked for a whisper of legend.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, punched through the nebula, its engines a low hum against the cosmic symphony.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of hyperspace were child's play compared to the political maneuvering and interstellar piracy that threatened her mission. Every jump across galaxies was a leap of faith, a calculated risk against the vast, indifferent indifference of the cosmos, a gamble for the future of humanity itself.
