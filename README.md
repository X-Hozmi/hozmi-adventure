
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange. Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the road were constant companions, but the whispers of Ys, of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, forging her into something stronger than she'd ever imagined.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and dealing with the constant threat of warp-core malfunctions were all part of a day's work. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life, and the courage it took to push beyond the known boundaries of humanity.
