
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a perilous but necessary passage to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of mythical beasts echo in the wind, adding to the thrilling uncertainty of her quest.  Her only companions are the worn map clutched in her hand and the unwavering hope fueling her journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hum, a constant lullaby against the backdrop of stellar explosions and the silent majesty of uncharted galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The risks are astronomical – hostile alien species, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the unmapped reaches of space. But the potential reward, a breakthrough for all humankind, fuels her unwavering determination.
