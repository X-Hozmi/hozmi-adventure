
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the air.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of monstrous beasts echoed through the canyons.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the promise of Ys, a city said to hold unimaginable power, fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across light-years of space.  Asteroids danced like deadly fireflies, and the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns threatened to rip her ship apart.  But Jax, hardened by countless voyages through the cosmos, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the shimmering blue of Kepler-186f, a jewel in the vast, inky blackness of space, promising untold riches and a future for her crew.
