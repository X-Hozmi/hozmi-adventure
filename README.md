
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a perilous cargo earned through weeks of harrowing travel across unforgiving lands.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the unpredictable weather threatened to bury her and her mule beneath a sudden avalanche. Yet, the glint of the distant city, a beacon of untold riches and potential, spurred her onward.  Each aching muscle, each scraped knee, was a testament to her journey, a story she would one day tell under a safer roof.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  The journey between galaxies had already taken years, a voyage fraught with cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormhole shifts.  Her crew, a motley bunch of xeno-linguists and astro-navigators, relied on her unwavering skill to reach their destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored haven for a lost civilization. The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the immensity of the universe and the tiny, brave ship that dared to explore it.
