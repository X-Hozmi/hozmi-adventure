
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing his ailing sister.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were companions on his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the vastness of space, a constant reminder of her isolation.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate vessels presented challenges far removed from Sir Reginald’s, but the spirit of adventure remained the same – the unyielding human desire to explore the unknown, to push boundaries, and to discover what lay beyond the horizon, however distant that horizon may be.
