
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both rider and beast tumbling into the abyss, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of having survived another day on this arduous pilgrimage across a land both breathtaking and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped territories beyond known space, seeking new habitable worlds for humanity's expanding colonies.  Navigating asteroid fields the size of small moons, dodging rogue black holes, and communicating across unimaginable distances were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of humanity’s fragile position in the cosmic ocean, but the allure of discovery, of charting a future among the stars, fueled her every decision.
