
Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold secrets lost to time and treasures beyond measure.  He faced bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts, but the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned brighter than any fear.  Each creak of saddle leather, each gasp of his weary horse, was a step closer to the legendary prize.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor sentient life unlike anything humanity had ever encountered.  The jump gates spat them into the unknown, a breathtaking expanse of celestial bodies.   Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of space pirates made every hyperspace jump a gamble, but the potential discovery, the chance to expand humanity’s understanding of the universe, was a risk worth taking. The vastness of space held both wonder and peril in equal measure.
