Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the swirling nebula outside his starship a breathtaking kaleidoscope of colors.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Kryll warships was a daily challenge, but the potential discovery of a new, habitable world – and the untold riches it might hold – fueled his relentless pursuit across the infinite expanse of space.
