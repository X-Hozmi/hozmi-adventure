
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creaking bridge, each shadowed forest, held the promise of both peril and discovery. Bandits, storms, and the sheer unforgiving landscape itself tested her resolve, but the thought of her brother spurred her onward, her heart a drumbeat against the rhythm of her horse's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the velvet expanse of interstellar space.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the complex politics of intergalactic trade routes was just as perilous as any medieval journey, demanding cunning, courage, and a healthy dose of luck.  The breathtaking beauty of nebulae and alien landscapes offered rewards beyond measure, yet the constant threat of rogue planets and hostile alien encounters kept the adrenaline pumping.
