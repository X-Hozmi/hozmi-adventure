
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel holding all her worldly possessions.  The scent of woodsmoke and sweat clung to her, a familiar perfume on this pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk overhead, held the thrill of the unknown.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the adventure, a harsh counterpoint to the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape and the camaraderie found in shared hardship around crackling campfires.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, a jewel shimmering emerald against the inky backdrop of space.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, hummed with a nervous energy.  The journey had tested their ship, their skills, and their courage, battling asteroid fields, navigating treacherous wormholes, and outrunning the relentless pursuit of a rival corporation. The discovery of new life, or even a new resource, would make their perilous journey worthwhile.
