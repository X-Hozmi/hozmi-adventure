
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bit at Elara's cheeks as she urged her weary horse onward, the rutted track a ribbon of mud snaking through the dense Ardennes forest.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Rochefort, felt as perilous as the treacherous paths themselves.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the forest itself seemed to whisper of unseen dangers, and every creak of her saddle leather amplified the gnawing fear in her heart.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the chilling reality of her isolation.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the Xylos Nebula, the vibrant colours of nebulous clouds a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of his starship.  His mission, to retrieve a rare mineral from the ice planet of Cryos, was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies.  While the technology offered a degree of safety unimaginable to medieval travellers, the vastness of space amplified the loneliness, every passing star a silent testament to his isolation amongst the countless wonders, and dangers, of the galaxy.
