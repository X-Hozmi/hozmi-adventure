
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a relic capable of ending the Hundred Years' War.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the trials that lay ahead. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, as he forged his path through the unforgiving landscape, driven by hope and the weight of his kingdom's fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship believed to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien maps were everyday occurrences.  The vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy was a thrilling and terrifying canvas,  a constant reminder of the immense distances and unimaginable wonders – and dangers – that awaited her on this perilous journey to the edge of known space.
