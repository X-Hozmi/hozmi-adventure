
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the parched plains of Castile, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offers little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings fresh challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the cold indifference of a world unforgiving to the lone traveler.  Her only companions are her unwavering spirit and the whispered stories of adventure that fuel her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant hues of alien planets swirl outside her viewport as she charts a course through unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, the whispers of their plight reaching her across light-years.  Unlike Elara, Ryla commands advanced technology, but the vastness of space presents its own daunting obstacles: treacherous asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment failure.  The unknown stretches before her, a tapestry woven from cosmic wonders and perilous dangers, beckoning her onward.
