
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a better life, a desperate gamble on a rumored, fertile valley far beyond the reach of the plague-ridden villages she’d left behind.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, with every sunrise, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by the promise of adventure and a future beyond the grim reality of her present.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova"  Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets and new trade routes.  The risks were immense – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the darkest reaches of space.  But for Ryla, the thrill of discovery, the vast unknown, far outweighed the dangers.  The galaxy was her playground, each new star system a thrilling chapter in an epic adventure.
