
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the sky, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, and the love for his sister, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy tested the ship's systems and her crew's resolve, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational wells.  But the promise of life on a distant world, the chance to make a difference, spurred Captain Rostova and her crew to brave the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
