
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside, the scent of rosemary and thyme battling the stench of sweat and unwashed wool.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Constantinople, seeking a cure for her plague-stricken brother.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge – bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Byzantine splendor, of silks and spices and untold riches, fueled her weary spirit and spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with bioluminescent flora and hostile, six-legged predators.  Warp jumps risked tearing his vessel apart, and navigating asteroid fields was a constant dance with death.  But the promise of unimaginable wealth, enough to secure his family’s future for generations, drove him and his crew across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, facing dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.
