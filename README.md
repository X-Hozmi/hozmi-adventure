
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her – a tapestry of emerald fields and shadowed forests. Her journey to Avignon, to seek healing for her ailing brother, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the whispering woods, and the whispers of the plague follow close behind.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, from fording rushing rivers to negotiating with suspicious villagers, forging alliances born of shared hardship and necessity. The road is long, but the hope of her brother's recovery fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, breaches the nebula, the swirling cosmic dust painting vibrant hues across her viewport.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos star cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Ryla and her crew face challenges far beyond anything imaginable in the medieval era.  The vastness of space, however, holds a different kind of peril; the loneliness of the void tests their courage as much as any earthly danger ever could.
