
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and dried meat.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees mountains added a thrilling edge to her journey to Santiago de Compostela. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential adventure, a test of her courage and resilience against the unpredictable wilderness and the even more unpredictable human element.  The thrill of the unknown, of discovering new lands and encountering different cultures, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known universe, faced not only cosmic hazards but also the mysteries of newly discovered planets, teeming with alien life, both wondrous and dangerous. The allure of charting unmapped galaxies, of finding new worlds and new forms of life, overshadowed the inherent risks, making every jump a breathtaking leap into the unknown.
