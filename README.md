
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward. The sun beat down relentlessly on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire, bound for the fabled city of Constantinople.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked his every step.  Each sunrise brought the risk of ambush, each nightfall the threat of starvation, yet the lure of adventure – the promise of untold riches and the glory of reaching his destination – spurred him ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of the Cygnus X-1 system.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The vastness of space held wonders beyond imagination, but also mortal dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new life and new worlds, fueled her unwavering determination, pushing her to the very edge of the known galaxy.
