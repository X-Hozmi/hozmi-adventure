
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed glades, the path was barely discernible, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at their dwindling supplies.  Yet, the lure of the fabled lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, propelled him and his small band of loyal companions ever forward, facing down wild beasts and treacherous terrain with unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of a million burning suns.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, tossing the crew against their restraints, but they'd made it to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Ahead lay the dangers of unknown alien lifeforms, treacherous gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirates who preyed on lone explorers in the outer reaches of known space.  But the promise of galactic exploration fueled her courage, driving her towards the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
