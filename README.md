
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto his face, mirroring the rutted tracks beneath his weary steed.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in his quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing daughter.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing uncertainty of whether he would reach his destination in time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Vast distances and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were the daily bread of her life, a far cry from the muddy trails of Reginald's era.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien life as dangerous as it was beautiful.  The stakes were higher, the technology more advanced, but the thrill of exploration, the inherent risk of the unknown, remained a constant in both timelines, a powerful draw for adventurers across the ages.
