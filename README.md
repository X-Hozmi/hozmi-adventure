They had braved treacherous mountain passes and fought off bandits in the name of profit, but the adventure was only beginning.  Rumors of a lost city, rumored to hold untold riches, whispered through the desert winds.  The lure of glory and fortune fueled their journey, each step a gamble in the face of the unknown.

The shimmering blue of the habitable moon of Kepler-186f filled the viewport.  Captain Anya checked the readings on her console, the ship’s AI reporting a stable approach.  She felt a thrill of anticipation, a familiar tingle of excitement that had been a constant companion since she joined the Galactic Exploration Corps.  This moon, nestled in a system light years away from Earth, was a new frontier.  They were on the cusp of discovering a whole new ecosystem, with the possibility of alien life.  The journey, a blur of hyperspace jumps and meticulous navigation, was merely a prelude to the adventure that awaited them.
