
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, a mere track through the unforgiving Ardennes forest, was barely discernible.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a stark reminder of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Aquitaine, bearing a vital message that could determine the fate of his own.  He carried with him only his sword, his shield, and the unwavering hope of survival, the landscape a constant challenge pushing him to the edge of his endurance.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating by the faint shimmer of distant quasars, she felt the hum of the Alcubierre drive against the hull.  The vast expanse of space offered a breathtaking beauty, but held equal measures of peril.  Asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels made each jump a gamble. Her mission: to reach the Kepler-186f system, carrying colonists to a potentially habitable world. The weight of countless lives rested on her shoulders, and the infinite darkness of space pressed in on her, testing her courage and skill beyond anything imaginable.
