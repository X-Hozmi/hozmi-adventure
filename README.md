
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier on her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Rumours whisper of untold riches and ancient magic, but the road is fraught with peril: bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of a monstrous wyrm echo through the desolate passes.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, a new step towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unmapped Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless gravitational pull of black holes is commonplace for him and his crew.  The hunt for the legendary Xylos crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, has brought them to the far reaches of the galaxy, a gamble that could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration – or seal their fate amidst the cosmic void.
