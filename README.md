
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and the weight of her family's hopes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of both peril and wonder. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, while the whispered tales of mythical creatures and hidden monasteries spurred her onward.  The journey was a tapestry woven with fear and exhilaration, the vastness of the land a constant reminder of her own smallness and the immense power of human resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of cosmic wonders outside.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory Void-Wraiths was a daily challenge, but the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human understanding and reaching for the stars, fueled her every action.  The universe was a vast and unforgiving ocean, but for Eva, it was home.
