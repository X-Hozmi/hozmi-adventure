
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, traverse the sun-baked plains. Their journey to the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis beyond the shifting sands, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed canyons, scorching heat threatens to claim them, and the whispers of djinn and sandstorms keep them constantly vigilant.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the lure of the unknown fuels their relentless onward push, a tapestry of hardship and hope woven into the very fabric of their medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter.'  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across a dozen planets after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predations of space pirates is routine, but the true challenge lies in deciphering the fragmented distress signals, each whisper a clue in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  The galaxy stretches before him, a canvas of infinite possibilities and unimaginable dangers, promising an adventure far beyond the confines of Earth.
