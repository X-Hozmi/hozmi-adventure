
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Rhineland.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present shadow of famine.  Yet, the glint of distant mountains, a promise of sanctuary and survival, fuels her onward.  This journey, fraught with peril, is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in a time of hardship.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive drowns out the vastness of space, a stark contrast to the quiet desperation of Elara's journey.  Here, the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the unknown inhabitants of Kepler-186f. Yet, like Elara, Eva is driven by a profound purpose: to discover, to explore, to expand the boundaries of human knowledge and reach for a future beyond the cradle of Earth.
