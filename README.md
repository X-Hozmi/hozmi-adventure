
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Elara's horse, a sturdy grey mare named Bess, picked its way through the rutted path.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, a shimmer on the horizon of Elara's ambition, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in the starship *Stardust*.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Warp drives hummed, starlight painted streaks across the cockpit, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and unknown celestial anomalies kept the crew on edge.  But the vast, unknown expanse of the galaxy, a canvas painted with a million suns, was a more seductive challenge than any earthly realm.
