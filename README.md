
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits a constant companion.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – from scorching heat and dwindling supplies to the whispers of mythical creatures lurking in the shadowed forests.  Our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, feels as distant as the stars themselves, a glittering prize at the end of a perilous journey.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cuts through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the potential for navigational errors leading to derelict space stations or worse, uncharted nebulae teeming with hostile life forms. Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, rich with resources and untold wonders, fuels our relentless pursuit across the cosmos. The universe is our playground, and the risks, though immense, are a small price to pay for the thrill of exploration.
