
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty air thick with the promise of adventure.  Ahead lay a treacherous trek across the Alps, a perilous passage through bandit-infested forests, and the unforgiving expanse of the Hungarian plains.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, pressed onward, each day a battle against the elements and the ever-present threat of violence.  The shimmering promise of Constantinople, with its silks and spices, fuelled our weary steps, a beacon in the vast unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky black between galaxies, each jump a leap of faith into the void.  Nebulae swirl like cosmic paint strokes around us, and the gravity wells of distant suns tug at our hull.  We're mapping uncharted territories, seeking out habitable planets teeming with alien life—or perhaps the remnants of civilizations lost to time. The universe is vast, and the risks are immense, but the reward – the discovery of new worlds – is a siren song too powerful to resist.
