
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease were constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating by the stars to bartering for meager rations in dusty, forgotten villages.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve strengthened, fueled by faith and the unwavering hope of reaching their sacred destination.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between days and weeks, yet the vastness of space remained a constant awe-inspiring and terrifying presence.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen became commonplace.  The journey was a testament to human ingenuity and courage, a relentless push into the unknown in search of a forgotten people, a whisper of hope echoing across the galaxy.
