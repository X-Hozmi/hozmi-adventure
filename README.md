
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city whispered to lie beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Every mile was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the lure of the Sunstone, a relic said to hold unimaginable power, spurred them on, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and peril.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of impossible colours.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Cosmic storms threatened to shatter their vessel, alien leviathans lurked in the inky blackness between stars, and the ever-present threat of navigation errors could leave them adrift forever. Yet, the hope of finding the colonists, and the lure of uncharted galaxies, fuelled her unwavering determination, making each jump into hyperspace a breathtaking gamble on the edge of eternity.
