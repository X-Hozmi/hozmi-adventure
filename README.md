
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear clinging to his own throat.  He was bound for the distant city of Prague, a journey fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and disease stalked the dusty roads.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking canvas of swirling colors and distant suns, held both wonder and danger.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, and alien encounters were commonplace, but the potential rewards—a new era of galactic peace—outweighed the inherent perils of interstellar travel.
