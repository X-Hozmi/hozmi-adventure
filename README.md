
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's worn boots sank into the mire. Her journey across the breadth of the Kingdom of Aeridor was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Days blurred into a monotonous cycle of aching muscles, meager rations, and the constant threat of bandits or wild beasts. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the fabled Sunstone, rumored to reside in the far-off monastery of St. Aldhelm, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Unlike Elara's arduous trek, hers was a journey of breathtaking celestial wonders, a tapestry of shimmering gases and distant star systems. Yet, the challenges remained; unpredictable wormholes threatened to tear her ship apart, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump through hyperspace a gamble.  But the promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a world ripe for colonization, fueled her determination, driving her across the vast emptiness of space.
