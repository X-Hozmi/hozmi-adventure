
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, a place said to shimmer with forgotten magic, spurred her onward. The journey was perilous, a tapestry woven with scorching heat, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the allure of the unknown fueled her spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational currents was child's play compared to the political machinations and corporate espionage that threatened her mission.  Each jump to hyperspace brought both the thrill of discovery and the chilling awareness of the vast, unforgiving expanse of space and the myriad dangers it held.
