
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather.  This journey, to reach the rumored monastery holding the lost scroll of Saint Fiacre, was fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a beacon brighter than any castle torch.


Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Rexx navigated the Xylos Nebula in the sleek, silver starship *Stardust*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kyron, a world teeming with unpredictable weather patterns and sentient crystalline lifeforms. The hyperdrive hummed a constant, low thrum against the backdrop of swirling nebulas, a hypnotic rhythm against the ever-present danger of asteroid fields and pirate scavengers.  The vastness of space, breathtaking and terrifying in equal measure, held the promise of untold riches and the certainty of death should one miscalculation occur.
