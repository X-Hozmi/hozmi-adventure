
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward. The rutted track snaked through a landscape of brooding forests and stark, windswept moors.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unforgiving vacuum of space were all part of the arduous journey.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her as she steered her vessel towards the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, a lone explorer charting a course through the infinite expanse of the future.
