
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate gamble to reach the rumored fertile lands beyond the King's borders. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey, testing her resilience and faith with each passing mile.  The whispers of adventure, though intoxicating, held a stark reality: survival itself was the ultimate prize.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a treacherous passage riddled with unstable wormholes and unpredictable gravitational currents.  The thrill of exploration pulsed through her veins, a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required to pilot her vessel through the unforgiving void. The vast unknown, a tapestry woven with wonders and dangers unimaginable, awaited.
