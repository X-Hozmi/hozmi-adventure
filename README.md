
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear hangs heavy in the air, a constant companion on her journey to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, promises both peril and possibility. Bandits, starvation, and the relentless sun are just some of the trials she faces, her spirit fueled by desperate hope and the unwavering strength forged in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the forgotten mining outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away and shrouded in legend.  The dangers aren't bandits or starvation, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted regions of space.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, pushes him onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the unfathomable expanse of the galaxy.
