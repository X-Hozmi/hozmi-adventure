
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant shimmer.  Her worn leather satchel holds not only meager rations but also a king's ransom in smuggled silks, a dangerous cargo that fuels her journey across the ravaged French countryside. Bandits, feuding lords, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death stalk her every step, making each sunrise a gamble and every sunset a hard-won victory.  The vast, untamed landscape itself, with its treacherous passes and unforgiving terrain, poses a constant challenge to her resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light years to a distant, uncharted galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silence of the void beyond the viewport.  Her mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the galaxy holds dangers far beyond the predictable: pirate fleets, rogue AI, and cosmic anomalies threaten to derail her mission, testing not only her piloting skills but her courage in the face of unimaginable cosmic wonders and perils.
