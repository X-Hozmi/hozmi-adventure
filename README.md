
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward, the muddy track a ribbon winding through the endless French countryside.  Each sunrise brought the threat of banditry, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present discomfort of lice and aching limbs. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered of in hushed tones, spurred them on.  The promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fueled their aching muscles and dampened spirits, pushing them further into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The Althea, a starship older than most of its crew, jumped through hyperspace, spitting us out into the swirling nebula of Xylos. Our mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from a planet shrouded in poisonous mists and guarded by creatures straight out of nightmare.  The thrill of exploring alien landscapes, the breathtaking vistas of nebulas ablaze with impossible colours, and the sheer audacity of venturing where no human had gone before, dwarfed even the mortal dangers we faced.  The galaxy was our oyster, a vast expanse of untold wonders and terrifying unknowns.
