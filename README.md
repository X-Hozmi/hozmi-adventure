
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights trudged onward, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, propelled them forward, their determination fueled by whispers of glory and the promise of untold treasures beyond the horizon.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Each jump through hyperspace brought its own risks – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the vastness of space, the mystery of the unknown worlds, and the potential for groundbreaking discovery spurred Eva onward, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering light of a potential new home for humanity.
