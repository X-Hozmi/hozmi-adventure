
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Anatolia in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage of both faith and desperation, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, the harsh terrain tested her resilience daily, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the burning desire to reach her destination fuelled her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, the swirling nebula of Xylos painting the viewport in vibrant, impossible colours.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unimaginable risks.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of interdimensional travel were all part of a day's work.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery in the boundless cosmos, outweighed the inherent dangers, pushing Ryla and her crew ever further into the heart of the unexplored.
