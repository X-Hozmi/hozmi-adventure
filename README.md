
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking behind the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains. Her journey from the fertile lands of the south to the rumored hidden city of Eldoria had been fraught with peril: bandits ambushing caravans, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispers of Eldoria's mythical healing springs, and the promise of a life free from the plague ravaging her homeland, spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed vow to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, the kaleidoscope of colours a breathtaking distraction from the precarious jump to the Xylos system.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital component for the newly-constructed hyperspace engine from a remote mining colony, a journey that spanned not miles but light-years.  The dangers were different now – cosmic storms that could tear a ship apart, pirate fleets lurking in the shadows of asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. But the reward – the potential to unlock faster-than-light travel for all of humankind – was a prize worth risking everything for.
