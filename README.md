
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and wonder. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and rumors of mythical beasts whispered around crackling campfires.  But the lure of the fabled city of Ys, said to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, fueled her journey, a promise of untold riches and secrets waiting to be unearthed.  The path was arduous, the risks immense, but the spirit of adventure burned brighter than the midday sun.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Ahead lay the Andromeda Galaxy, a swirling kaleidoscope of billions of suns and uncharted planets.  The mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Cluster, rumored to contain a source of limitless energy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space held dangers far exceeding any terrestrial threat. But the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, drove Rexa and her crew onward, into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
