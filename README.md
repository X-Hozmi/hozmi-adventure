
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of peril – bandits, starvation, or the wrath of a capricious god.  Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered of in hushed tones at taverns along the route, fueled her onward.  The journey was fraught with hardship, but the whispered legends, the chance of discovery, made the risk worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions were far removed from the medieval dangers Elara faced, but the inherent risks remained.  The vastness of space, the unknown nature of alien life, and the constant hum of the ship's failing hyperdrive all contributed to a journey as perilous, though in a different way, as Elara's quest across the medieval world.
