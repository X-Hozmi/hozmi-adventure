
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease that stalked the land.  Yet, the lure of survival and the possibility of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory K'tharr warships, Ryla relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to survive. The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to the boundless possibilities and perils of galactic exploration.
