
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones by travelling merchants – a city of untold riches and even more dangerous secrets. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges facing Elara and her small caravan as they pressed onward, fueled by a mixture of hope and sheer stubbornness.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship the *Stardust Wanderer* a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The mission: to retrieve a rare mineral from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and alien life. Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets, but the journey was far from effortless; navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling malfunctioning systems were all in a day’s work for a seasoned explorer like Jaxx.  The vastness of the cosmos held both incredible beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the risks inherent in galactic exploration.
