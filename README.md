
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the burning hope that fueled his arduous journey across the war-torn kingdom. Each sunrise brought the promise of a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Cosmic storms, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were commonplace hazards. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover the fate of her ancestors, pushed her relentlessly forward.  Every jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, uncaring immensity of space.
