
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the promise of finding her lost brother a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a testament to human ingenuity, a leap across unimaginable distances.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each new system a potential treasure trove of discovery, driving her and her crew across the cosmos.
