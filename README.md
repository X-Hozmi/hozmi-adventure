
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward through the muddy byways of France.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagons, each snapping twig underfoot, held the potential for ambush by bandits or the chilling whisper of the Black Death.  Our destination: the rumored lost city of Ys, a legendary haven whispered to hold unimaginable treasures and forgotten magics.  The journey itself, fraught with peril and hardship, was an adventure as grand as the promised reward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The Althea, a starship built of shimmering, self-repairing alloys, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet teeming with a form of energy capable of solving the galaxy’s impending energy crisis.  We faced dangers far removed from bandits – rogue asteroids, hostile alien life forms, and the ever-present threat of warp-core malfunctions.  Yet, the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and the thrill of exploring uncharted territories made the risks worthwhile.
