
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-infested forests, and past villages where suspicion lingered like the stench of unwashed bodies. Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or disease, but the lure of Zerzura, and the whispered promise of its magic, kept his weary legs moving.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex, her breath misting in the frigid air of the Xylos bridge, piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, plotting a course through nebulae and asteroid fields, a journey that would take generations by conventional means. The thrill of exploration, the vastness of the unknown, fueled her.  The promise of new worlds, new civilizations, and perhaps even answers to the universe's deepest mysteries, made the risks of hyperspace jumps and potential encounters with hostile alien races, worth every heart-pounding moment.
