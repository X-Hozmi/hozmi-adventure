
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her satchel, heavy with maps and meager supplies, bumped against her hip.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, sent shivers down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness.  She was on a quest for the legendary Sunstone, a journey fraught with peril, promising both immense fortune and certain death should she fail. The whispers of bandits and mythical beasts were far less frightening than the gnawing loneliness of the endless road.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula, its hyperdrive a hum against the infinite silence of space.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos system, she charted a course towards the unexplored Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  The thrill of discovery warred with the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation and rogue space debris.  Her crew, a motley band of explorers, relied on each other, their camaraderie a beacon in the vast, uncaring darkness between worlds.
