
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, famine, or the slow, agonizing death of disease.  Yet, the promise of the fabled City of Ys, whispered on the wind, spurred her onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel; a journey measured not in miles, but in the resilience of the human spirit and the endless expanse of the unknown.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart a steady counterpoint to the ship's humming engines.  Unlike the medieval adventurers before her, her journey wasn't hampered by physical limitations, but by the vastness of space itself; light years stretched between star systems, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien encounters. The quest for the mythical Kryll artifact, however, fuelled her courage, a siren's call echoing across the galaxies, promising untold power and knowledge – a reward worth the risks of interstellar travel.
