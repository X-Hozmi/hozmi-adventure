
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawing at our bellies.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Sunstone city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred us onward.  The journey was as perilous as it was exhilarating, a constant test of endurance and courage against the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Unlike the medieval perils of land travel, the dangers here were cosmic – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on unsuspecting transports.  The vast, inky expanse of space offered a different kind of breathtaking panorama, one filled with swirling nebulae and distant galaxies, but the journey was no less demanding, requiring precise navigation and unwavering resolve to reach the distant shores of Xylos.
