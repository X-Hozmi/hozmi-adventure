
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of windswept moors, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in shadowed forests.  He dreamt not of glory, but of reaching Jerusalem, of finding solace and perhaps, a reprieve from the gnawing fear that had become his constant companion since leaving his family behind. The creak of leather, the snort of his steed, and the distant call of a hawk were the soundtrack to his arduous pilgrimage, a testament to the relentless spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with a similar blend of fear and exhilaration.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity. Unlike Gareth's journey measured in months, hers spanned years, the vast distances between stars a constant reminder of the daunting scale of interstellar travel.  Yet, the shared human impulse remained – the unwavering drive to explore the unknown, to push the boundaries of what is possible, fueled by hope and a thirst for discovery.
