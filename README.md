
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the whispered tales of werewolves kept their spirits low, and the unforgiving landscape tested their endurance at every turn. Yet, with each sunrise painting the sky in hues of fiery hope, the allure of the sacred shrine and the thrill of the unknown spurred them onward, a tapestry of adventure woven from hardship and determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova's starship, *The Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's burgeoning interstellar empire.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the potential for encountering hostile alien civilizations or navigational anomalies.  But the vastness of the cosmos, with its promise of untold discoveries and the sheer audacity of exploring the infinite, made the risks worthwhile.
