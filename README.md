
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals a breathtaking vista – snow-capped mountains piercing the azure sky, ancient ruins whispering tales of forgotten empires, and bustling market towns overflowing with the exotic spices and silks of the Orient.  The journey is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the shadows, disease stalks the weary, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and experiences beyond imagination, pushes us onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship powered by harnessed quasars, cuts a silent path through the velvet void.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and awe-inspiring, punctuated by the swirling nebulae, distant supernovae, and the chilling silence broken only by the hum of our ship's engines.  The risks are different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present danger of system failure.  But the quest for knowledge, the thirst for exploration, remains the same driving force, pushing us across the galactic ocean to the far reaches of the cosmos.
