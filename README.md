
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the whispering rumors of mythical beasts kept even the bravest knight on edge.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious rest beneath a sky ablaze with the colors of both hope and fear.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the unmapped Kepler-186f.  Her mission: to establish a permanent human colony on a potentially habitable exoplanet.  The vast distances were punctuated by the eerie silence of space, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of comms.  Asteroid fields posed deadly threats, and the ever-present risk of equipment malfunction hung heavy in the air. But the promise of a new beginning, a new world, fueled her relentless journey across the unimaginable gulf of space.
