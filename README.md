The rutted track, barely a path across the windswept moor, offered little comfort but plenty of challenge.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort of his weary steed, was a testament to the arduous journey across the kingdom.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers demanded careful fording, and the constant threat of starvation hung heavy in the air.
