The rough track, barely a trail through the whispering woods of Arden, offered little comfort but the promise of adventure.  He sought the lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones – a city of gold and magic, guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled his anticipation, a mixture of fear and exhilarating hope for the unknown that lay ahead.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

She carried with her not only the hopes of humanity for a new home, but also the weight of a thousand untold stories of exploration, a legacy of brave pioneers pushing the boundaries of human reach amongst a breathtaking tapestry of stars.
