
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its breath misting in the frigid air.  Her journey across the fractured kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to send both horse and rider plummeting to their doom, and the constant gnawing fear of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispers of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient healing, spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to reach her destination, no matter the cost.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across light-years of interstellar space.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of pirates preying on interstellar trade routes, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps all tested her and her crew's mettle.  But the promise of a cure for a galaxy-wide plague fueled their courage, making the unimaginable distances and dangers a worthwhile risk.
