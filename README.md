
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura whispered about in hushed tones by wandering merchants. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant threats, but the lure of the unknown – the promise of a different world beyond the familiar – propelled her onward, her heart a drumbeat against the rhythmic clop of hooves on stone.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking canvas, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a desperate search against the odds.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids were challenges far removed from Elara's, but the intrepid spirit of exploration, the yearning for discovery, burned as brightly within Ryla as it had in her medieval counterpart.
