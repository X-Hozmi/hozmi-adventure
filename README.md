
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to bury her alive in snowdrifts. Each crest of the mountain revealed a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, the shimmering promise of the city a distant, almost mythical goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was child's play compared to the political intrigue and resource scarcity that threatened her mission at every turn.  The vast emptiness of space held both unimaginable wonder and chilling isolation, the search for a distant hope a daunting task against the infinite backdrop of the cosmos.
