
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track winding through the unforgiving French countryside.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the dreaded Black Death, whispered to stalk the land.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril but fueled by unwavering faith and a desperate hope for redemption.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, every nightfall a precarious gamble against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and potentially lethal xenofauna.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, yet the dangers remained as real as ever – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of the galaxy.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each landing a delicate dance between survival and discovery.
