
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s small band pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  The thrill of the unknown, however, fueled their weary bodies, the promise of adventure outweighing the hardship of their arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light-years away across the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was less about physical exertion and more about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the bone-jarring effects of warp speed.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with swirling colors and distant starlight, held a different kind of peril and wonder than any medieval trek, but the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, remained the same.
