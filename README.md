
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown spurred her forward, fueled by a faith stronger than any hardship, a faith that whispered of miracles and the hallowed ground awaiting her at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hummed, a constant, comforting thrum against the silence of space.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, seeking new habitable worlds for a humanity desperate for expansion.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering alien life, both friendly and hostile. But the boundless expanse of the universe, a sea of stars beckoning exploration, held a similar allure to Elara's pilgrimage, a promise of discovery and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.
