
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing fear that Zerzura was nothing more than a myth, leaving only the harsh reality of the unforgiving medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable warp currents tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  The vast, alien beauty of the cosmos contrasted sharply with the perilous realities of interstellar travel, where even the smallest malfunction could be fatal.  The reward, however, promised a future free from the limitations of Earth's dying resources.
