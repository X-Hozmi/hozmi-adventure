
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Aquitaine in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling breath of death itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering hope that fueled his every stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of the cosmos dwarfed even the grandest medieval adventure, yet the human spirit, with its relentless pursuit of exploration and discovery, remained unchanged across the millennia.
