
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the western sea.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the obstacles she faced, each sunrise bringing a new challenge and a renewed sense of determination to her perilous journey. The whispered tales of Ys fueled her, a beacon in the vast unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Warp jumps through swirling cosmic clouds, encounters with strange alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of system failures tested her crew's mettle.  The vast, uncharted expanse held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, making each journey a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of space.
