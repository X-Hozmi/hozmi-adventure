
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs and a chipped map, her only companions the rasping cries of vultures overhead and the rhythmic clop of hooves on parched earth.  She sought the legendary lost city of Ys, a fool's errand some said, but the glint of gold in a dying monk's eye and a whispered prophecy had fueled her journey for months, pushing her through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the grim beauty of a landscape both unforgiving and breathtaking.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Warp drives hummed, a low thrum that vibrated through the ship's metal bones as they jumped between galaxies, charting unknown star systems for the Galactic Federation.  The dangers weren't bandits or wild beasts, but unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids the size of planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the allure of the unexplored, the thrill of discovering new worlds teeming with alien life, fueled her relentless pursuit of the universe's mysteries, mirroring Elara's centuries-old quest for a lost city.
