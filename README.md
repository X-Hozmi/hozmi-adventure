
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork quilt of weary humans and laden beasts, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress towards the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the sudden, brutal wrath of nature.  Yet, the whispered promises of untold riches and ancient secrets fuel our onward journey, a testament to the enduring human spirit's thirst for the unknown, braving the perils of medieval travel to chase a dream.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Starseeker' cuts through the inky black, its trajectory charting a course between glittering nebulae and distant galaxies.  We, a crew of seasoned explorers, grapple with the complexities of hyperspace jumps and the chilling silence of the void. The lure of new worlds, potentially teeming with life both wondrous and terrifying, outweighs the ever-present danger of solar flares, asteroid fields, and the unsettling unknown that dwells beyond the reach of human understanding.
