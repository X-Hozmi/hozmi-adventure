
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her weathered face.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of Aquitaine was a gamble – a desperate race to reach her ailing brother before winter's grip choked the land. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of fear through her, but the unwavering image of her brother's face spurred her onward.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand was her only guide, a promise of safety and reunion at the journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting the cockpit in a breathtaking, yet perilous, panorama.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a remote research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards, but the sheer scale of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, never failed to remind her of the immense risks, and the incredible rewards, that awaited those brave enough to explore the furthest reaches of space.
