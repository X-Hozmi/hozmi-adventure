
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He was bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the scorching desert offered little respite from the sun's relentless glare.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers to ford, and the constant gnawing fear of disease and starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Samarkand’s riches and wonders fueled his relentless push eastward, a flicker of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in years, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present risk of cosmic radiation and unforeseen celestial events.  But the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new life and charting unmapped territories across the galaxy, far outweighed any danger. The vast expanse of space held its own terrors, yet it offered a freedom and adventure far beyond the medieval world’s wildest dreams.
