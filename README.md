
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-slicked back, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies in the crowded caravan.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and potential discovery – bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable whims of nature all lay between him and his desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal flickering weakly from beyond known space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the capricious gravity wells of unexplored planets was a daily challenge.  The thrill of discovery, the immense scale of the cosmos, and the ever-present danger of encountering alien lifeforms, both benevolent and hostile, made every jump through hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
