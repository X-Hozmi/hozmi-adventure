
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Each creak of her saddle was a reminder of the arduous journey ahead – a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs far beyond the Serpent's Tooth Mountains.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the whispered promise of a miraculous cure fueled her onward, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones lining the path.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut through the inky blackness of space.  The vibrant nebulae swirling outside her viewport were a breathtaking distraction from the complex calculations required for hyperspace jumps between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vast distances, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate raids were formidable challenges, but the potential reward – a future free from intergalactic conflict – spurred Rexa and her crew to push the boundaries of human exploration.
