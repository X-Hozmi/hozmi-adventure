
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the King's urgent missive, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city far to the east.  Each creaking step is a gamble against bandit raids, treacherous cliffs, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The adventure is fraught with peril, but the chance to prove her worth and perhaps even earn her freedom fuels her onward, her eyes fixed on the distant, hazy peaks promising both danger and deliverance.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The journey across galaxies is measured not in days, but in light-years, a voyage punctuated by warp jumps and the constant hum of the hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to exist on a planet orbiting a dying star, a planet shrouded in ancient mysteries and guarded by hostile alien lifeforms.  The vastness of space offers a different kind of peril – the unknown, the unpredictable, and the ever-present risk of mechanical failure – but the lure of discovery and the potential to reshape galactic power keeps her course steady among the stars.
