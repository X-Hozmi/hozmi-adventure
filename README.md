
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's steed as he crests the hill, the vast, untamed landscape of France stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the key to ending the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new peril – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered promises of salvation, propel him onward, a solitary figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.  She faces dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval knights – hostile alien lifeforms, collapsing star systems, and the ever-present threat of navigational error.  But the vastness of space, the promise of discovery, fuels her courage as she navigates the uncharted territories of the future.
