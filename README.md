
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wagon wheels a constant soundtrack to their perilous journey eastward.  Their destination: Samarkand, a fabled city shimmering in the hazy distance, promising untold riches and a chance to escape the encroaching famine in their homeland.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the vast, unforgiving landscape itself posed a constant threat, but the lure of adventure, and survival itself, pushed them relentlessly forward. Each sunrise brought new challenges— treacherous river crossings, hostile tribes, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with dangers unseen by mortal eyes.  Unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids the size of moons, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested her crew's skills and courage.  Yet, the vastness of space held a seductive power, a promise of discovery that outweighed the inherent risks. Each jump into the unknown was a gamble, but the potential rewards—new worlds, new technologies, new knowledge—fueled their unwavering pursuit of the cosmos.
