
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, and the treacherous mountain passes tested both her resilience and her mule's.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating flooded river crossings, bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages, and relying on the kindness – or tolerance – of strangers.  Yet, the vastness of the landscape, the shared stories around crackling campfires, and the unwavering goal spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat deemed impossible by many.  The ship bucked and vibrated as they navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of unseen celestial bodies.  The risks were immense – a single miscalculation could mean annihilation – but the potential rewards, the discovery of new worlds and civilizations, outweighed the danger.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, punctuated by the vibrant colours of nebulae and the cold, hard brilliance of stars, both terrified and exhilarated him.
