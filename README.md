
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath of her horse, mirrored the anxieties gnawing at her.  She carried a secret message, vital to the survival of her village, clutched tight within her worn leather satchel.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were only some of the obstacles facing her on this perilous journey across the length of France, a journey as vast and uncertain as the fate of her people.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos nebula, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities, and the immense dangers, that lay beyond the known universe.
