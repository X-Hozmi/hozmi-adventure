
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the jagged peaks, and the path itself was a perilous dance with crumbling rock and sudden ravines. Yet, the glint of gold in her worn leather pouch, a payment for a dangerous escort, spurred her onward.  Survival, and the whisper of legend, drove her across the unforgiving landscape.

A thousand years hence, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hyperdrive hummed a low, resonant thrum, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness outside.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond the known universe.  But pirates, ruthless and technologically advanced, patrolled these far reaches of space, and the navigational charts were notoriously unreliable. The gamble was immense, but the potential reward—the unlocking of the cosmos itself—made the risk worthwhile.
