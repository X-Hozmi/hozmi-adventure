
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a dangerous mission to secure a vital alliance in the faraway kingdom of Aragon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown, the chance to shape history, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new breathtaking vista, a new step towards her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol system and the newly discovered Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering the enigmatic signals from alien civilizations were commonplace risks.  The vastness of space offered a terrifying beauty, a sense of isolation punctuated by the vibrant colors of distant planets and the silent hum of the hyperdrive.  The galaxy was her playground, a boundless expanse teeming with opportunity and peril in equal measure.
