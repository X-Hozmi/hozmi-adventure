
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than supplies; it held the hope of finding her lost brother, a rumour whispered in a tavern of a caravan heading east to the Silk Road.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill and the terror of the unknown – bandits, disease, and the endless, unforgiving expanse of land itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate chase against time and fate.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic vistas visible through the cockpit.  But the vastness of space held dangers as profound as any medieval wasteland – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  Nova's journey was a quest for scientific advancement, but also a test of courage against the unimaginable scale of the universe.
