
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zamora, a quest for a rumored healing herb, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve at every turn.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, fueled by the whispered tales of Zamora's wonders and the desperate need to reach it before winter's icy grip tightened its hold.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through a nebula shimmering with the colours of a thousand dying suns.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and wrestling with the capricious whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar courier.  The vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos, both beautiful and dangerous, offered a different kind of adventure than Elara’s, but the thrill of the unknown, the relentless pursuit of a distant goal, remained a constant.
