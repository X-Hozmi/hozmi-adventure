
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, a perilous journey to retrieve a stolen relic from a distant monastery, had already claimed two of his companions.  Each sunrise brought the chilling uncertainty of bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the relic in his mind’s eye, a promise of salvation for his beleaguered kingdom, spurred him onward. The whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten magic fueled both his terror and determination.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the inky expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's burgeoning population.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of rogue black holes tested the limits of her crew's resilience and the ship's advanced technology.  Alien encounters, both benevolent and hostile, were as commonplace as the breathtaking nebulae that painted their journey across the cosmos. The ultimate reward, a new home for humanity, felt both impossibly distant and tantalizingly close.
