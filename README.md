
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag, mirroring the grime on her face after weeks traversing the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey from the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence to the misty highlands of Scotland had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered legends of the mystical Loch Ness monster, and the hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother, fueled her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure, each hardship a test of her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperately overcrowded Earth.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held equal measure of danger.  Uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel all threatened to end her voyage prematurely. But Eva, with a steely gaze and a heart full of daring, pressed on, driven by the hope of securing a future for humanity amongst the stars.
