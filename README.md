
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants and pilgrims, snaked across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The shimmering mirage of the distant oasis, their promised land, offered only fleeting hope against the gnawing reality of their arduous journey across the desolate plains.  Each creak of their wagon wheels was a testament to their resilience, each shared hardship forging an unlikely bond amidst the vast unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the tremor barely registering amidst the thrum of the Althea's hyperdrive.  Their journey across the Andromeda galaxy was far from peaceful; pirate attacks, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids kept the crew on high alert.  But the promise of Xylos, a planet brimming with rare minerals and untold riches, fuelled their determination, a celestial treasure awaiting those daring enough to navigate the treacherous currents of interstellar space.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of loneliness than the medieval plains, but the thrill of exploration burned just as brightly.
