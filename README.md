
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill and terror of the unknown.  Her journey to the fabled city of Constantinople, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every sunrise, the promise of adventure fueled her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of his navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet of Aethelred, a world rumored to be guarded by sentient crystalline beings.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with glittering stars and perilous black holes, held a different kind of danger; the unknown was less about bandits and more about gravitational anomalies and hostile alien lifeforms. But the allure of exploration, the chance to chart new territories and push the boundaries of human knowledge, was a siren song he couldn't resist.
