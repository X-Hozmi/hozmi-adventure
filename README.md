
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his armor rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey across the blighted lands of Albion had been fraught with peril – bandits ambushed them near the whispering woods, a raging river nearly swept them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic, kept them pressing on, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel-like planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The journey was a breathtaking dance with the cosmos, navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the monotonous hum of the hyperdrive. But the thought of those miners, stranded on the edge of known space, fueled her determination, making the vast emptiness between worlds a canvas for her courage and resilience.
