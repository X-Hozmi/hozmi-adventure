
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by whispered legends and the unwavering hope of discovering the lost city before winter's icy grip tightened its hold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the Xylos wormhole.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of dimensional rifts.  But the thought of finding her missing crew, their families waiting on distant Earth, spurred her onward, a beacon in the seemingly endless expanse of the cosmos.
