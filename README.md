
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new landscape – sun-drenched vineyards, towering mountain passes, and unforgiving deserts where mirages danced cruelly on the horizon.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of Zerzura, propelled him forward, each hardship only strengthening his resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a rogue black hole decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, the cosmic tapestry outside her viewport a breathtaking, terrifying spectacle.  Asteroids the size of mountains were dodged with practiced ease, and the ever-present threat of solar flares kept her crew on high alert.  But the allure of rediscovering a lost civilization, the potential for uncovering untold knowledge, far outweighed the perils of interstellar travel.
