
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small company pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease. Yet, the glint of Eldoria’s rumored gold, and the hope it offered, spurred them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its absolute limit.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet, but also unknown dangers – alien predators, hostile environments, or the simple, crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed the peril, fueling her resolve to explore the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
