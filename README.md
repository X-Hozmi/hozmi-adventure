The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the treacherous peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each crest offered breathtaking views, but also harbored the potential for ambush: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of treacherous terrain.

Yet, the allure of the unknown and the thrill of charting new pathways through the cosmos burned brighter than any fear. The galaxy awaited her.
