
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mare across the unforgiving plains of Iberia.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones amongst the desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this perilous journey, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels her onward. Each sunrise paints a new challenge upon the horizon, testing her resilience and pushing her to the very limits of human endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the star-strewn void aboard the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the Andromeda Galaxy, a feat considered impossible by many.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown entities in the uncharted sectors make this a journey far more perilous than any land-based expedition. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge propels her and her crew forward, into the heart of the infinite.
