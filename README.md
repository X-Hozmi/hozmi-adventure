
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swirling dust cloud against the ochre landscape, creaked onward towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the known world, spurred us onward.  The promise of unimaginable riches, lost knowledge, and perhaps even magic, fueled our weary bodies and ignited the flickering flame of hope in our hearts.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts a shimmering path through the nebula, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Captain Eva Rostova, her face etched with the map of a thousand galaxies, charts a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with peril – pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving vastness of space. But the potential reward – a revolution in interstellar exploration – is a risk worth taking for Eva and her daring crew.
