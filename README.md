
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The map, brittle with age, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains, a fabled city of gold rumored to lie nestled in a valley untouched by time.  His journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to claim both horse and rider, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whisper of untold treasures, fueled his relentless push towards the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement that had vanished without a trace centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll raiders, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's aging technology. The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, a silent, unforgiving expanse that dwarfed even the most daring human ambition.  But the promise of discovery, of uncovering the colony's fate, burned brighter than any star.
