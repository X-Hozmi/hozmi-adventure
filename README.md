
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains fiery red.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and exposure. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represents, fuels his unwavering determination to press onward, even as the shadows lengthen and the wolves begin their nightly howls.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey for habitable planets suitable for human colonization.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and deciphering the enigmatic signals emanating from unknown civilizations,  Eva faces dangers far removed from medieval knights and bandits, but no less perilous. The vastness of space, the uncharted territories, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms demand courage, ingenuity, and an unwavering spirit of exploration.
