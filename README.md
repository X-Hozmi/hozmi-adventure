
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis lost in the sands of the Sahara, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  His meager supplies dwindled with each day, the sun a relentless enemy, but the promise of untold riches and forgotten magic fueled his weary bones. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the dunes, held the potential for adventure – or disaster.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr space pirates, Elara pushed her ship and her crew to their limits. The vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos held both incredible beauty and unimaginable dangers, a tapestry woven from starlight and the relentless pursuit of the unknown.
