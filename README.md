
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Castilian plains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and water skins; it contained a map, painstakingly copied from a crumbling monastery scroll, leading to a rumored lost city said to hold untold riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of the unknown, the ever-present danger of bandits or wild beasts a constant companion to the siren song of adventure.  She pressed on, spurred by hope and the fierce independence that burned within her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vast, star-dusted canvas outside her viewport held a breathtaking, terrifying beauty.  Her mission: to chart unexplored systems, searching for habitable planets suitable for human colonization.  The journey itself was a gamble, each jump through hyperspace a calculated risk, the potential for encountering unforeseen celestial anomalies a constant threat. But the promise of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach beyond the known, fuelled her relentless drive across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
