
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Yet, the whisper of hope, carried on the wind, spurred her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Thorne piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Navigation was a treacherous dance through asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes, each jump a gamble against the void.  But the weight of responsibility, the memory of her people's plight, fueled her engines, propelling her towards a future uncertain, yet promising a chance at salvation for all.
