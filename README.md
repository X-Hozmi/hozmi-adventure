
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a seemingly impossible quest for the legendary Sunstone, had driven her across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, past whispering forests guarded by unseen things, and through villages ravaged by famine.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed passes, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown, a fear that fueled her determination as much as her dwindling supplies.  The Sunstone, or death – those were her only options.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of colors and dangers. His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the sentient planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with strange and beautiful life, but also guarded by hostile, technologically advanced flora.  Warp jumps between galaxies were commonplace, yet the unpredictability of space – rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – made every voyage a gamble with fate.  The galaxy was vast, beautiful, and deadly, a testament to the relentless human drive for exploration, no matter the cost.
