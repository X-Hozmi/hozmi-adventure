
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was far from over; bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed.  Yet, the whispered legends of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing village, fueled her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every strained breath, was a testament to her unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra "Nova" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and deciphering ancient star charts all while managing the temperamental AI, HAL-E, tested her every skill. The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, but the hope of finding survivors, and perhaps uncovering the secrets of the anomaly, propelled her forward across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
