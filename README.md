
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Burgundy, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure and danger that clung to him like the clinging forest air.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a crucial data core from the abandoned mining station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day's work for Eva. The vast, uncharted expanse of space offered a different kind of adventure, one measured in light-years instead of leagues, but the thrill of exploration burned just as brightly in her heart.
