
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged castle, had sent her across the unforgiving plains of Francia.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, and the whispers of the Black Death haunted every village.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, with every mile, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by the promise of salvation and the thrill of the perilous journey itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable spatial anomalies that threatened to tear her ship apart.  The vastness of space instilled both awe and a chilling loneliness, a stark contrast to the vibrant alien landscapes she explored – shimmering crystal forests on Kepler-186f, or the bioluminescent oceans of Proxima Centauri b. Each jump to a new star system was a leap into the unpredictable, a thrilling gamble in the grand cosmic lottery.
