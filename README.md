
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zamora, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the whispered promise of healing spurred her onward, each aching muscle fueled by a fierce determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic beauty a stark contrast to the mission's deadly seriousness.  Their quest: to retrieve a vital data crystal from a derelict research station orbiting a black hole.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crippling effects of Xylos's intense radiation were all in a day's work for Nova and her crew. The galaxy held untold wonders, but it was a dangerous playground, and the stakes had never been higher.
