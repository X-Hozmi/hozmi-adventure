
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s worn boots as he spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the chilling grip of starvation.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, breathtaking vistas, and the unwavering hope that whispered in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a rogue asteroid field decades prior.  Navigating treacherous wormholes and evading space pirates was child's play compared to the psychological toll of the endless void. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of discovering new alien life amidst the cosmic dust, propelled her and her crew towards the unknown, a testament to humanity's relentless thirst for exploration across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
