Bandits lurked in the shadows, mythical beasts roamed the untamed wilds, and the very air crackled with the unseen magic of this forgotten land.  Each day brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies. His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone, demanded courage, resilience, and a healthy dose of luck.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.

The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, presented a different kind of challenge than any medieval adventurer could have imagined, but the thrill of exploration remained a constant companion.
