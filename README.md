
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more hope than coin, its contents a collection of dried herbs and a brittle map promising a rumored monastery harboring ancient healing secrets.  Every rustle of leaves, every distant hawk cry, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the lingering chill of the Black Death itself.  Her journey was a gamble against both nature and fate, a testament to human resilience in a time when a single wrong turn could mean death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's shimmering veil.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a technology that could bridge the vast gulf between galaxies.  The journey had already claimed lives and tested the crew's mettle against gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids.  But the lure of unlocking interstellar exploration, of finally mapping the uncharted reaches of the cosmos, spurred them onward, their courage a bright spark against the unending darkness of space.
