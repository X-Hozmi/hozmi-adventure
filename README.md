
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains of Eurasia as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant battle hung heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every hardship, her resolve hardened, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess knowledge of faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risks.  The vast expanse of space, teeming with undiscovered wonders and unimaginable dangers, held the allure of a thousand Zerzuras, promising untold riches for those brave enough to seek them.
