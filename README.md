
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Ys, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across churning rivers swollen with spring melt, and past brooding forests where whispers of lurking bandits chilled the air.  Each day brought new challenges – exhaustion, hunger, and the ever-present threat of raiders – but the lure of Ys, a city said to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred them on.  Their horses' hooves pounded a rhythm against the unforgiving earth, a counterpoint to the relentless beat of their own determined hearts.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay the Andromeda galaxy, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and celestial wonders, but also a perilous voyage across uncharted space.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the watchful eyes of hostile K'tharr warships, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen supplies tested the crew's mettle. The reward, however, was the potential discovery of a new habitable planet – a prize worth risking everything for in their quest to expand humanity's reach among the stars.
