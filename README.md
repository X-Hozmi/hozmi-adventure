
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling taverns and cobbled streets of London he'd left behind.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria whispered to exist beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains, led him through treacherous passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where brigands and worse lurked.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the allure of the unknown propelled him forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril; asteroid fields threatened to rip the ship apart, while alien leviathans patrolled the interstellar currents.   Eva, however, was undeterred.  The vast emptiness of space held no fear for her; only the thrill of discovery and the promise of unlocking humanity's destiny among the stars.
