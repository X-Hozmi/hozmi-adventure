
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on her and her mule.  Their journey from Canterbury to Rome was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and the unwavering hope of reaching the Holy City, where she sought a cure for her ailing brother.  The vibrant tapestry of medieval life – bustling market towns, hushed monasteries, and the stark beauty of the wilderness – unfolded before her, a constant reminder of the vastness and the danger of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading rogue AI pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were all part of a day's work.  Yet, the breathtaking vistas of nebulas painted across the cosmos, the discovery of new lifeforms, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration made the risks worthwhile.  This was the age of galactic expansion, and Nova was at the forefront, carving a path through the infinite.
