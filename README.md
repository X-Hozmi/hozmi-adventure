
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to ending a devastating plague.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse, the mysterious sickness itself, stalking him across the unforgiving landscape.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting kindness from strangers, and the persistent hope that fuelled his desperate ride.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint but persistent against the cosmic hum.  Vast distances, treacherous asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were her constant companions.  But Elara faced a greater threat – the relentless pursuit of the Kryll, a ruthless alien empire determined to claim the colony's advanced technology for themselves.  The vastness of space, while offering breathtaking beauty, also held the chilling reality of isolation and the ever-present danger lurking just beyond the next star.
