
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the distant monastery, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send her tumbling to her death, and the constant gnawing hunger was a companion as relentless as the sun. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed determination fueled her onward, fueled by the unwavering hope of reaching her destination before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula shimmering with a thousand impossible colors.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, unknown celestial bodies loomed as potential hazards, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a gamble.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of unmapped planets teeming with untold wonders, was a beacon that steered her ever forward, into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
