
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of mercenaries pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust devils against the setting sun. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of glory, kept them moving, their resolve tested but unbroken.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Starseeker' across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking canvas, a far cry from the dusty plains of Kaelan’s journey. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage fraught with the dangers of uncharted space, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  But the unknown beckoned, promising scientific discovery and the chance to expand humanity’s reach across the cosmos – a journey as thrilling, if vastly different, from Kaelan's medieval quest.
