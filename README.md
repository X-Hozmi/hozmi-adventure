
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula. Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a precious scroll containing ancient prophecies, the key to her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the scorching sun beats down relentlessly.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the dry brush, is a potential threat, yet the lure of the sacred destination fuels her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unpredictable expanse of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have mastered faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of uncovering a lost civilization, a civilization that could hold the key to galactic peace, keeps the engines roaring and her spirit unyielding across the vast, unknowable distances of the galaxy.
