
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery hidden deep within the Black Forest, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching night.  Yet, the whispered promise of healing spurred her onward, a beacon in the growing darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across a dozen planets following a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirates of the Outer Rim, she relied on her crew's skill and the ship's aging hyperdrive.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space held both immense beauty and terrible danger, but the faint hope of finding survivors – and uncovering the truth behind Aethel's disappearance – propelled her ever forward.
