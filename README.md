
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering resolve in her heart, fueled by the suffering back home, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent backdrop of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolutionary leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of celestial bodies was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political intrigue that threatened to derail her expedition.  The vast expanse of space, however, held a beauty and mystery that both terrified and exhilarated her, a constant reminder of the colossal scale of her undertaking and the potential rewards it promised.
