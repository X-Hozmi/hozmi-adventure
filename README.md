
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to lie beneath the waves.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown, but the promise of Ys, and the thrill of the journey itself, spurred her onward.  The clinking of her worn waterskin was a constant reminder of the fragility of life, a counterpoint to the wild freedom of the open road.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been harrowing, a near-miss with a rogue asteroid field a stark reminder of the inherent risks of interstellar travel.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to a powerful, ancient energy source.  But the whispers of hostile alien races and unpredictable wormhole currents filled the comms, making this journey as perilous – and thrilling – as any medieval knight's quest.
