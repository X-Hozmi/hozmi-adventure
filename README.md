
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel, containing a tattered map and a few precious coins, held the weight of her destiny.  Each creaking cart wheel and barking dog was a reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next ridge – bandits, disease, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical City of Eldoria, and the promise of untold riches and knowledge, spurred her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Corvus piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive and the distant crackle of cosmic radiation were his constant companions, a stark contrast to the vibrant holographic maps charting his perilous course through asteroid fields and unexplored sectors. The lure of discovery, of charting new worlds and unraveling the secrets of the galaxy, far outweighed the inherent risks of interstellar travel.
