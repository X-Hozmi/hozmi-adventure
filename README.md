
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s boots as she spurred her weary horse across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother’s wasting disease.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a reminder that the journey, fraught with peril as it was, held the key to her family's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unmapped gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense scale of her task. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, spurred her crew onward towards the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
