He'd left the familiar comfort of Camelot weeks ago, his quest a perilous journey across the untamed wilds of Albion to reach the mythical Isle of Avalon.

Encountering hostile alien civilizations, navigating asteroid fields, and repairing critical systems under pressure were all part of a galactic adventurer's life. The reward, however, was the thrill of exploration and the hope of finding a lost civilization.
