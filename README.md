
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant city of Porthaven.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the sense of peril, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that stalk these lonely paths.  Survival is a daily gamble, but the promise of salvation, a flicker in the vast unknown, keeps her pushing onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of untold power rumored to exist on a remote planet orbiting a dying star.  The journey is fraught with dangers; unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failures. Yet, driven by the thrill of discovery and the allure of the unknown, Ryla presses on, charting a course across unmapped galaxies, a lone explorer in the vast expanse of space.
