The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the oppressive heat.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous bogs, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of wild beasts lurking in the shadows.

Each warp jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and courage in the face of the infinite expanse of space.
