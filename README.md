
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the bruised autumn sky, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track snaked through a primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost Crown of Aethelred.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised either peril or discovery.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the uncharted lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the unknown entities that lurked in the unmapped regions of space.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to the galaxy's future, and Eva was determined to find it.
