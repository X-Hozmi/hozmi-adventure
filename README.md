
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland – was a treacherous journey across unforgiving landscapes.  Each day brought new perils: bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s healing waters fueled his determination, pushing him further into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks were commonplace hazards.  The vast distances between star systems demanded months of hyperspace travel, punctuated by the monotonous hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present weight of loneliness.  But the hope of finding the lost colonists, and the thrill of galactic exploration, kept her spirit unbroken.
