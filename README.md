The map, a crudely drawn parchment, promised riches in the faraway city of Samarkand – silks, spices, and perhaps even the fabled Sunstone.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscapes of Eurasia.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his stubborn resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys; the reward, however, promised to reshape the fate of humankind itself.
