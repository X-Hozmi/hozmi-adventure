
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Bandits, treacherous paths, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the unwavering resolve in her heart, fueled by the desperate pleas of the sick, pushed her ever onward.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a chance to conquer the next brutal mile and bring solace to those left behind.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to solving the galactic energy crisis.  The vast emptiness of space was a stark contrast to the rugged mountains Elara had faced, but the challenges were no less daunting.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the relentless hum of the hyperdrive kept her senses sharp.  Yet, the weight of responsibility—the fate of billions resting on her shoulders—was a burden heavier than any mountain range.
