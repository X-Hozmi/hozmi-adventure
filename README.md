
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Ahead lies the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her arduous journey.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the promise of both peril and discovery, fueling her unwavering resolve to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets, her crew pushes the boundaries of human exploration.  The thrill of charting unknown star systems, encountering alien civilizations (both benevolent and hostile), and the endless possibilities of the cosmos far surpass any terrestrial adventure.  The journey itself, a testament to human ingenuity and courage, is the ultimate reward.
