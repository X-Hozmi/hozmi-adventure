
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a chipped map promising a legendary lost city.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the wild lands offered little mercy.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whisper of forgotten magic and untold riches, spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Kar'tar navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his hyperdrive-equipped starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the mythical Alora Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across entire galaxies.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted regions of the cosmos.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of known space, fueled his journey, a solitary explorer charting the infinite canvas of the universe.
