
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to Canterbury was proving longer and far more arduous than the maps promised.  Each sunrise revealed new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs swallowing entire wagons, and the constant gnawing hunger that only stale bread and meager rations could partially alleviate. Yet, with each sunrise also came the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands and the whispered promise of adventure at the journey's end, a promise worth more than gold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky black between galaxies. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting constant, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle outside her viewport: swirling nebulae painted across the void like cosmic brushstrokes, distant galaxies spiraling into existence and oblivion.  Their mission, a daring expedition to chart a newly discovered cluster, held both the excitement of unmapped territories and the ever-present danger of encountering the unknown - alien civilizations, gravitational anomalies, or even the terrifying emptiness of space itself.  The journey, a lifetime in the making, held the potential for glory, or utter annihilation.
