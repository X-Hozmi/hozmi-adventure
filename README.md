
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, untamed landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His journey across the Holy Roman Empire had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Zerzura, with its fabled treasures and ancient secrets, spurred him onward, a flickering candle of hope against the encroaching darkness.  Each creak of his saddle, each rasp of his horse's breath, was a testament to the harsh beauty and unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated efficiency of her ship's controls. Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the cosmic expanse.  The journey was a lonely one, punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the occasional burst of static on the comms.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial formations, and the potential for discovery fueled her determination, making the dangers of asteroid fields and rogue black holes pale in comparison to the adventure awaiting her among the stars.
