
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a victory against the relentless mud and the gnawing hunger in my belly.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier between me and the fabled city of Eldoria.  Every creak of my pack, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the uncharted lands.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria's gold and the promise of untold riches spurred me onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Outside, the swirling nebula painted a breathtaking canvas across the viewport, a kaleidoscope of colours unimaginable to medieval eyes.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The journey, though measured in light-years rather than miles, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the black.  But the potential rewards, the advancement of humanity itself, eclipsed any fear, making the perilous voyage to Xylos a necessary gamble.
