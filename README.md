
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both danger and discovery.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and rumors of a mythical city whispered on the wind, fueling her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar spices, the sight of distant mountains piercing the hazy sky – these were the rewards of a life lived on the open road, a life far removed from the confines of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His ship, a nimble freighter barely clinging to the edges of known space, hurtled through a nebula, the swirling colours a vibrant, terrifying spectacle.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The galaxy held countless wonders and unimaginable dangers, but Rexx, a veteran of countless jumps across the vast cosmos, felt the familiar thrill of the chase.  The risk of pirates, rogue black holes, and the unknown itself was a small price to pay for the promise of untold riches and the glory of discovery.
