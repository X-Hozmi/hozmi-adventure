
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of Eldoria’s healing springs fueled his weary legs, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of vibrant colours, its swirling gases a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to harbor a rare element crucial to interstellar travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering strange alien lifeforms, and battling the ever-present threat of malfunctioning technology were all part of a day's work for a galactic explorer.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the boundless possibilities and the immense dangers that lay beyond the known universe.
