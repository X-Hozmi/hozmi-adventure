
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The shimmering heat rising from the sun-baked fields of France did little to deter him; the King's ransom, hidden within a worn leather satchel at his hip, spurred him relentlessly towards the distant, treacherous mountains. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the continent, a desperate gamble for fortune and survival. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both death and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of swirling cosmic dust.  The hyperdrive hummed, a reassuring thrum against the silence of deep space, as she charted a course towards the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  While pirates and disease were less of a concern, the vastness of space, potential gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present danger of unknown alien life forms posed a different, equally formidable, threat in her quest to unlock the secrets of a new world.
