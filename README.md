
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its creases hinting at countless foldings and refoldings.  Each rise revealed new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward. The journey was arduous, but the promise of adventure burned brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The vibrant colours of nebulas painted a canvas across the viewport, dwarfing even the most breathtaking sunsets of old Earth.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace presented a gamble; unpredictable gravitational anomalies and pirate factions were constant threats.  But Jax, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown, pressed on, the weight of his crew's hope and the promise of galactic discovery driving him across the vast expanse of space.
