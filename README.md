
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across the continent was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the promise of the legendary lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, fueled her relentless pursuit, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but also the breathtaking beauty of a world largely untouched by the modern world.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source hidden on the remote planet of Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a test of endurance and skill, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars.  But the true adventure wasn't just the vastness of space, it was the unknown: the potential for discovery, the thrill of facing the alien and the unexpected, all in the pursuit of a future shaped by daring exploration.
