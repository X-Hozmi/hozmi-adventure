
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend among the travelling merchants, promising untold riches and adventure.  Bandits were a constant threat, the terrain unforgiving, and the nights filled with the howls of wolves – but the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the perils of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unknown dangers of unstable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  Though the technology offered a stark contrast to Elara's perilous trek, the spirit of adventure remained the same – a relentless pursuit of the extraordinary, a defiance of the mundane in the vast expanse of space and time.
