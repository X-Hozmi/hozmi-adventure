
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, perilous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing uncertainty of their success, yet the lure of the legendary city fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship rumored to have discovered a new, habitable planet beyond known space.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, she relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's aging hyperdrive.  The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.
