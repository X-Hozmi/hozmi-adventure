
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to the wind like a chilling premonition.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-earned victory in a race against time and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with exotic flora and potentially hostile fauna.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders a constant shadow in the vast expanse of the galaxy.  Every jump was a gamble, every planet a new and potentially deadly adventure in the relentless pursuit of her goal.
