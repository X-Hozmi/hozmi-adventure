
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the treacherous mountain pass in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey to the Sultan’s court had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the promise of untold riches and the glory of reaching their destination fueled their relentless advance. The rhythmic clop of hooves against the cobbled road was a constant companion to the anxieties and hopes that filled their hearts.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby compared to the chaos of the asteroid field they’d just navigated.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of legend on the fringes of known space.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos was a constant reminder of their isolation, yet the possibility of discovering a new civilization, of charting unmapped territories among the stars, spurred her onward.  The universe stretched before them, a tapestry of wonder and danger in equal measure.
