
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s chausses as she urged her weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and the ever-present gnawing fear of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose propelled her forward, the whispered legends of the Apostle's tomb a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rourke piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in subjective years thanks to relativistic time dilation, was a tapestry of breathtaking cosmic vistas and terrifying near-misses with rogue asteroids and unpredictable spatial anomalies.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and brutally indifferent, tested the limits of human endurance and technology, a relentless challenge mirroring the medieval pilgrimages of old.
