
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bites at Sir Gareth's face as he urges his weary steed onward, the rutted track disappearing into the vast, whispering forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking branch, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse – yet the desperate hope for salvation fuels his journey across the treacherous landscapes of a medieval Europe steeped in both beauty and peril.  He carries with him not only his sword but the weight of his people's fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling on the edge of known space, a journey across light years of cosmic wonders and lurking threats.  Nebulae paint breathtaking canvases across the void, but asteroid fields and pirate raids are ever-present dangers.  The vastness of space magnifies both the isolation and the shared humanity of her crew, bound together by a common purpose against the backdrop of a breathtaking, yet unforgiving, galaxy.
