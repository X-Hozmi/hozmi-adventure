The King's summons to the far north had thrown him into a perilous journey, a tapestry woven with the threats of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Each sunrise brought new challenges – a ford too deep, a village offering meager hospitality, the unsettling silence of vast, empty plains.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.

The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed upon her, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her adventure and the potential rewards, or catastrophic failures, that lay ahead.
