
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – rare herbs desperately needed by her ailing village.  Each day brings new peril: bandits lurking in shadowed ravines, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of healing fuels her onward, a flicker of defiance against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The journey is arduous, the destination uncertain, but the spirit of adventure burns bright.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with dangers unseen.  Nebula storms threaten to crush her vessel, alien leviathans lurk in the void, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders hangs heavy. But the promise of rediscovering humanity's lost kin, and perhaps even unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel, fuels her tireless pursuit across the cosmos. The journey is epic, the challenges insurmountable, yet the thrill of interstellar exploration propels her forward.
