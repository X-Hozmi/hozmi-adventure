
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than her hopes of reaching the fabled city of Ys.  Each crest offered a breathtaking panorama of rugged valleys and distant, snow-capped peaks, yet the beauty was overshadowed by the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous paths, and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  This journey, a pilgrimage born of a whispered prophecy, tested her spirit more fiercely than any battlefield ever could.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rourke piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate was all in a day's work for Razor, but the loneliness of interstellar travel was a different beast altogether.  The shimmering beauty of the cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and swirling gases, offered little solace against the gnawing emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the vibrant, dangerous landscapes of his ancestors' time.
