
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the plague.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, felt both a desperate prayer and a reckless gamble, the rough-hewn path a tapestry woven with equal parts faith and fear.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages offered fleeting comfort amidst the vast, uncertain expanse.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, she relied on instinct and advanced technology to chart a course through nebulae and asteroid fields. The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel. The thrill of exploration battled the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life or navigational errors that could strand them forever in the black. The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of light and dark, held both unimaginable wonders and potential annihilation.
