
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a haphazard collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brings its own peril: bandits lurking in rocky canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones of unimaginable wealth and splendor, keeps us moving, our hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.  The vast, unknown landscape unfolds before us, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the vast gulf between galaxies, a tiny speck against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos. Each jump is a gamble, a dance with unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters. Yet, the pursuit of knowledge, of uncovering ancient civilizations lost to time and space, drives us onward. The universe, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and uncharted planets, awaits exploration, a challenge to our courage and resilience that far surpasses anything our medieval ancestors could have imagined.
