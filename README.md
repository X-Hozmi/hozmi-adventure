
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the tales of bountiful harvests and shimmering castles whispered in taverns weeks ago.  His quest, a perilous journey to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elmo, led him through treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, across rivers swollen with spring thaw, and into the shadowed depths of the Whispering Woods, where even the bravest knights feared to tread.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Raiders, a fearsome spacefaring race, tested her skill and nerve.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the cold brilliance of distant stars, was as lonely and unforgiving as any medieval wasteland, but the promise of rediscovering lost humanity fueled her every jump to hyperspace.
