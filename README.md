
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, shadows lengthening as twilight fell.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent a jolt of apprehension through him – bandits were a constant threat, and the whispers of mythical beasts lurking in the deeper woods were enough to chill even the bravest knight.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her controls.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess a unique energy source vital to the survival of her people.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate vessels, Elara pushed herself and her crew to the limit, driven by the hope of finding a new home amongst the stars.
