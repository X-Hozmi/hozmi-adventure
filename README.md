
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Robbers, disease, and starvation were constant companions on his journey from the English court to the Holy Roman Empire, a pilgrimage undertaken to deliver a vital message.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through him – an adventure as perilous as any knightly quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space held a different kind of terror than any forest could; the silent, crushing weight of the void, the unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding habitable worlds, fuelled her journey across the galaxy, a quest as bold and thrilling as any medieval knight's pilgrimage.
