
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, guided his weary horse across the parched landscape.  Each day was a gamble; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages they passed.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, rumored to be hidden within the untamed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, spurred him onward. The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of untold riches and glory fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the discovery of a new energy source vital to the survival of the human colonies scattered across the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory warships of the Kryll Empire, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval knights.  The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, held both unimaginable riches and unimaginable annihilation.
