
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – seeds of a new life, a new harvest for the ravaged village left behind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the Black Death itself stalked the land, a shadow as vast as the horizon.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate bid for survival etched against the backdrop of a crumbling kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue energy storms.  Unlike Elara, Eva faced a different kind of peril, one of cosmic proportions, where failure meant not just death, but the annihilation of a fragile hope for humanity's expansion amongst the stars.
