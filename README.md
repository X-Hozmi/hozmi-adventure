
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each weary mile, her spirit soared.  The camaraderie of fellow travelers, the kindness of strangers, and the breathtaking beauty of the land fuelled her onward, transforming hardship into an unforgettable adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane connecting the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, held countless unknowns.  Uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the potential for encountering alien lifeforms – all presented exhilarating challenges.  Each jump to lightspeed was a leap of faith, a thrilling plunge into the unfathomable, a testament to human courage and the endless pursuit of discovery.
