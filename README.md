
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and drying herbs a meager comfort against the biting wind.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harsh elements themselves.  Yet, the hope in her heart, as fierce and unrelenting as the sun beating down on her back, pushed her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Starbreaker' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy. His mission: to locate a lost colony ship, its coordinates a cryptic whisper from a dying star.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory tendrils of space krakens demanded skill and courage beyond measure.  The vast, indifferent expanse of space held beauty unmatched by any terrestrial vista, but also harbored dangers far exceeding any medieval threat - radiation storms, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the black.  The vastness of space, a sea of stars, both terrified and exhilarated him.
