
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the ever-present danger – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself threatened to derail her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with its own perils – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any known civilization. But the potential reward, the promise of unlocking interstellar exploration for humanity, outweighed the risks, fueling their relentless voyage across the cosmic ocean.
