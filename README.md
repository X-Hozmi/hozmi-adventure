
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria spurred him on, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon flickering faintly on her long-range scanners.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Elara, hardened by years of spacefaring, pressed onward, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of the colony's silence.
