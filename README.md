
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that mirrored the swirling anxieties in their hearts.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the King's plague-ridden land.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the Sunstone, and the hope it represented, propelled them forward through sun-drenched days and starlit nights.

Centuries later, Captain Elara steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission, far more complex than a simple quest, was to locate a lost colony scattered across multiple planets in a newly discovered galaxy.  Hyperspace jumps were perilous, fraught with the risk of encountering rogue asteroids or hostile alien patrols.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes of each planet, and the unknown dangers lurking in the darkness presented challenges far exceeding any medieval knight's.  Yet, the hope of reuniting with lost humanity fueled her journey across the cosmos.
