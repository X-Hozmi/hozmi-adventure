
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each winding path presented a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, coupled with the fierce love for her brother, fueled her onward, a lone speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with the hum of the Alcubierre drive.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and facing the ever-present risk of system malfunctions were all part of the arduous journey. Yet, the knowledge that she was providing a lifeline to those struggling for survival on a distant world gave Nova the strength to overcome every obstacle, a solitary beacon of hope traversing the vast emptiness of space.
