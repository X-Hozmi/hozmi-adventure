Weeks of relentless travel had taken him across the treacherous, bandit-ridden passes of the Pyrenees, the sun beating down mercilessly on his helm.  Each night held the promise of ambush, each village a gamble; but the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, and the rumored treasures within, spurred him onward.  The rustling of leaves, the distant howl of a wolf – each sound amplified his growing sense of unease and anticipation.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship shuddered against a gravitational current.

The shimmering, alien landscapes of the planets below promised riches beyond measure, but also unknown dangers, waiting in the shadows of unmapped systems and hostile alien civilizations. The thrill of exploration, a legacy inherited from the medieval adventurers before her, pulsed in her veins.
