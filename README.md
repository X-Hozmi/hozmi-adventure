
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister’s wasting illness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or its grim counterpart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost amidst the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets, and facing the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all in a day’s work.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Her journey was a testament to human ingenuity, a daring exploration into the unknown depths of the cosmos.
