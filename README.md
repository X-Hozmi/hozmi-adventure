Ahead lay the vast, untamed expanse of the Ardennes forest, a whispered promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, rumored to be as numerous as the trees themselves, haunted the shadowed trails, and the whispers of magic, both dark and light, hung heavy in the air.

The rewards were immeasurable – new resources, unimaginable technologies, and the thrill of pushing humanity's boundaries into the vast, uncaring immensity of space. The risks, however, were equally profound.  A single miscalculation could mean oblivion.
