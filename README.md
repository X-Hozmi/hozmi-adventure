
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of distant Jerusalem – a city whispered about in hushed tones – spurred her onward, fueled by faith and the unwavering spirit of a pilgrim on a perilous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and negotiating wormhole jumps were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the uncharted territories they explored.  Seeking out new habitable planets, Ryla and her crew faced unknown alien species, treacherous gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of void storms that could obliterate a ship in an instant. Their adventure, however, promised unimaginable discoveries and the possibility of finding a new home amongst the stars.
