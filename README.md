
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried meats and meager coins; it contains a meticulously crafted map, a whispered promise of a hidden monastery rumored to possess ancient healing secrets.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the gnawing hunger is a constant companion, but the allure of the unknown – the chance to save her ailing brother – fuels her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust Drifter* hurtles through the inky blackness between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored nebula known as the Whispering Void, a region whispered to contain lost technologies from a long-vanished civilization.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory space pirates that plague the intergalactic trade routes are constant threats, but the potential discovery of knowledge untold – the chance to unravel mysteries older than time itself – drives her crew forward, each warp jump a leap into the breathtaking and terrifying unknown of the cosmos.
