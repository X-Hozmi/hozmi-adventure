
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth distorted the distant spires of Camelot, a beacon promising respite from the bandit-ridden roads and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each hesitant step of his mount, was a testament to the arduous journey, a pilgrimage through sun-scorched fields and dark, foreboding forests, a tapestry woven with peril and the unwavering hope of reaching his destination.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Captain Eva Rostova's ears as she navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of alien gas giants painted the viewport, a breathtaking backdrop to the perilous journey across the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace anomalies and hostile alien encounters.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the epic scale of their adventure.
