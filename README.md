
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, and the vast, unforgiving desert stretched before her like a shimmering, deadly ocean.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, each sunset the chilling reality of her isolation in the face of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, cursing a rogue asteroid field. His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, bucked and shuddered as it navigated the treacherous gravitational pull of a dying star.  His mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, promising a new beginning for humanity. The cosmos, vast and indifferent, presented a challenge far exceeding any earthly obstacle, but the hope of a new world fueled his every action.
