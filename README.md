He dreamt of distant cities, of silks and spices, of stories exchanged in smoky taverns. Each day brought a new challenge, a new peril, a new encounter with the wildness of the unknown.

They were pioneers, charting the course for future generations, risking their lives to unravel the mysteries of the universe.
