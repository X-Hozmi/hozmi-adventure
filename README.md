
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the sprawling, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little beyond dried meats, a few precious coins, and a map more faded than her hopes.  She's bound for Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by desperation and a whispered promise of a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse, but the unwavering glint in her eye speaks of a resolve forged in necessity.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the possibility of salvation spurs her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast, swirling colours paint the viewport, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  The journey is not without its dangers – pirate raids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  But the potential reward, a breakthrough that could reshape interstellar civilization, fuels Ryla's courage and pushes her ever deeper into the uncharted expanse.
