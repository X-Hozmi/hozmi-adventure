
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone, a relic said to hold the power to banish a creeping blight from his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on his arduous journey across the kingdom and beyond, testing his courage and resourcefulness at every turn.  Each sunrise brings new perils, each sunset a prayer for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outsmarting ruthless space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals are everyday occurrences on her interstellar voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, holds both unimaginable wonders and deadly dangers, pushing Elara and her crew to the limits of their endurance as they search for a future amongst the stars.
