
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her plague-stricken brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the odds.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp jumps through treacherous wormholes, skirmishes with space pirates, and the constant hum of the ship's engines were the backdrop to her odyssey.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a promise of untold wonders, and perhaps, unimaginable dangers.
