
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the setting sun. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was a daily routine, but the loneliness of interstellar travel was a far greater enemy. The shimmering nebulae and distant galaxies were breathtaking, yet Eva longed for the familiar blue marble of her home, a world she might never see again.  The weight of humanity's survival rested on her shoulders, a burden heavier than any physical obstacle.
