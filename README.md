
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving fates of the medieval world.  The journey tested his courage, his resilience, and his very spirit, leaving him perpetually bruised, but driven by the unwavering hope of a reunion.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Hyperspace jumps risked encountering rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational anomalies, while pirates and rival corporations lurked in the shadows of the galactic expanse, threatening her cargo and crew.  Unlike the medieval world's limitations, technology gave her speed, but the vastness of space presented its own unique and terrifying challenges, each jump a leap of faith across the uncharted emptiness.
