
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band crested the hill, the sun glinting off their battered chainmail.  Before them stretched the seemingly endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-baked fields, ancient forests whispering secrets of bandit lairs, and the ominous silhouettes of castles perched precariously on distant peaks. Their quest: to deliver a sacred relic to a besieged monastery, a journey fraught with the perils of brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in their desperate race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less perilous.  Warp-drive malfunctions, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace threatened to swallow them whole.  But the lure of discovering new life, of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled her and her crew, pushing them to the very edge of their technological and personal limits in their audacious voyage into the unknown.
