
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and constantly battling the gnawing fear of the unknown that lay ahead.  Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city shimmering in legend, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational currents and treacherous asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, held both wonder and danger.  Communication with Earth was intermittent, leaving her and her crew reliant on their wits and the ship's aging technology. The thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, and the quiet companionship of her crew were all that stood between them and the cold, indifferent emptiness of the cosmos.
