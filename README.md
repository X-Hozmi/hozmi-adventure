
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest to find a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zaragoza's healing waters fueled her onward, a beacon in the growing darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey measured not in days but in months of hyperspace jumps and meticulous navigation.  The vastness of the cosmos held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of engine failure.  But for Eva, the call of the unexplored galaxies, the promise of discovery, outweighed any risk.
