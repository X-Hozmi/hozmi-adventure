
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests.  Each day brought fresh perils – bandits lurking in the shadows, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the saint's blessing, and the thrill of the unknown, propelled them forward, their resolve tested by the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable vastness.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien lifeforms. Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Eva had advanced technology at her fingertips, but the sense of wonder and the potential for catastrophic failure remained strikingly similar, proving that the human spirit's thirst for adventure transcends time and space.
