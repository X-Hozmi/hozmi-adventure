
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, famine, or worse.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to a besieged castle hundreds of leagues away, felt as endless as the horizon itself. The sun beat down relentlessly, mirroring the pressure of her mission; failure meant certain death for those she sought to warn.  She pressed on, spurred by a desperate hope flickering in her heart amidst the grim realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped wormholes and rogue asteroid fields.  The ship’s AI, a sardonic entity named HAL-E, constantly chirped warnings about gravitational anomalies and potential engine failures.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of medieval travel, the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of interstellar navigation presented a different kind of harrowing adventure; a single miscalculation could mean oblivion amidst the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos.
