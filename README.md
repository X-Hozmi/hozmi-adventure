
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, whispers of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of famine.  The road is a ribbon of peril, but the hope of salvation pushes her onward, through sun-drenched valleys and storm-wracked mountains, towards a destiny unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colonized planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space holds wonders unseen, from shimmering asteroid fields to breathtaking celestial displays, but also unimaginable dangers: rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, but the needs of the colony, and the thrill of exploration, fuel her journey across the galaxy.
