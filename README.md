
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby brush, heightened the ever-present tension.  Her quest: to reach Avignon and deliver a vital message to the Pope, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The promise of gold spurred her onward, but it was the unwavering belief in her mission that truly fueled her arduous trek across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid field was child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting her on Kepler-186f. Her mission: to broker a peace treaty between warring factions on the distant planet, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with interstellar pirates, bureaucratic red tape, and the ever-present threat of xenophobic aggression. The hefty galactic credits were secondary; it was the hope of preventing a galactic war that truly drove her across the cosmos.
