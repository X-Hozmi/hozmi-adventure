
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices, a perilous cargo that had already cost him two companions to bandits and fever.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by werewolves and worse, but the promise of riches in the distant port city of Venice fueled his weary legs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both terror and fortune.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from her home.  The journey wasn't perilous in the traditional sense; advanced technology shielded her from cosmic radiation and asteroid fields.  Yet, the vastness of space, the unnerving silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines, fostered a different kind of fear, a profound loneliness in the face of unimaginable scale. The success of her mission, the search for life beyond Earth, rested on her shoulders, a weight as heavy as any medieval burden.
