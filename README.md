
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a stark backdrop to the sun-baked plains below.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – rare herbs destined for a monastery far across the continent.  Each day was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled unpredictably, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every sunrise, a fresh surge of determination spurred her onward, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination and the thrill of the unknown.  The journey was the reward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst cosmic giants.  Her mission: to retrieve a sample of Xylos' unique energy crystals, vital to sustaining life on the drought-stricken planet, Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was treacherous, fraught with the risk of encountering rogue asteroids and unforeseen gravitational anomalies. But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the sheer audacity of interstellar travel ignited a burning passion within her – a lust for the unknown that echoed the medieval traveler's spirit, though on a far grander scale.
