
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered legends, was her only guide through the uncharted territories beyond the King's borders.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown bushes, held the potential for both peril and wonder – bandit ambushes, mythical beasts, or the discovery of long-lost ruins.  The thrill of the unknown fueled her journey, a stark contrast to the stifling routine of village life she'd left behind.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faint glimmer of a distant quasar.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of the cosmos remained awe-inspiring.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  The mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a civilization clinging to the edge of known space.  The dangers were not wild beasts or brigands, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from home.
