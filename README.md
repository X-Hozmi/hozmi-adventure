
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The map, a crude parchment clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches and glory in the faraway kingdom of Eldoria – a land said to shimmer with gold and magic.  His journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown pushed him further, a lone knight errant against a backdrop of medieval hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of stars, held a different kind of danger than Thomas had faced.  Asteroid fields threatened to shatter her ship, unpredictable solar flares could fry her systems, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at the crew's morale.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amidst the cosmic expanse, fueled their relentless journey across the galaxy.
