
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  He was bound for the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the whispers of djinn and otherworldly creatures haunted the endless desert.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the galactic core's stability from the ice planet of Nird, a world notorious for its unpredictable gravitational fields and sentient ice storms.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic signals emanating from Nird itself – signals that hinted at a long-forgotten, and potentially dangerous, civilization.
