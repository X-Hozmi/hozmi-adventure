
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle parchment – a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation – that lurked between her and her desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the legendary 'Aetherium' – a substance capable of powering faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, depicting a course fraught with gravitational anomalies and uncharted asteroid fields.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant sparkle of countless stars, was both terrifying and exhilarating, a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the infinite expanse beyond their home world.
