
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, wild beasts roamed the highlands, and the ever-present threat of starvation clung to the heels of every weary traveler.  Yet, the whispered tales of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging her village, fueled her onward, pushing her past exhaustion and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable currents of hyperspace always held the potential for disaster.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien life both beautiful and deadly.  The rewards were immense, the risks even greater, as Ryla knew the galactic empire wouldn't hesitate to claim her prize, no matter the cost.
