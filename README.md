
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless journey.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to etch his name into legend, spurred him relentlessly across the vast and unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey requiring jumps through unstable wormholes and navigation through uncharted asteroid fields.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, faced the constant threat of equipment malfunctions, alien encounters, and the ever-present possibility of getting irrevocably lost in the cosmic void. But the potential discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of a long-lost civilization, fueled their relentless pursuit across the infinite expanse of space.
