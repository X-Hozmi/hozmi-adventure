The dust of the King's Road swirled behind them, a testament to days spent traversing the unforgiving landscape.  Rumors of a hidden city, shimmering with untold riches and guarded by mythical beasts, fueled their perilous journey.

The promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories in the cosmos, outweighed the risks inherent in interstellar travel.  The galaxy beckoned, a boundless ocean of stars waiting to be explored.
