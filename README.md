The dusty track wound through a landscape as unforgiving as it was beautiful, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a constant, looming presence.  His quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a legendary artifact said to hold the very power of the sun.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but minor inconveniences in his determined pursuit of glory and the salvation of his kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges, testing his courage and skill as he journeyed across the breadth of the land.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms was commonplace on her interstellar voyages.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the hum of her ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with an unyielding spirit, pressed onward, fueled by the hope of finding the lost colonists and unraveling the mysteries of the wormhole itself.
