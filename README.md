
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a worn map, and the hope of finding her brother, lost amongst the crusaders years ago.  Every creaking cart, every campfire flickering in the distance held the potential for danger – bandits, disease, or the simple cruelty of the unforgiving landscape – yet the thirst for adventure, for answers, spurred her relentlessly eastward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Asteroids the size of mountains loomed in the darkness, and the unpredictable gravitational pull of Xylos itself threatened to crush his vessel, but the allure of the unknown, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fueled his every decision.  The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, was his battlefield.
