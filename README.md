
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving far more arduous than the worn maps promised.  Bandit raids were a constant threat,  rivers swelled dangerously with spring rains, and the endless expanse of forest held secrets both beautiful and terrifying.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and faith, a new vista unfolding across the rugged landscape of medieval Europe.  His destination felt further with each passing day, but the lure of the holy city and the thrill of the unknown kept his weary bones moving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony on the edge of explored space.  The journey was a tapestry woven from the hum of warp drives, the crackle of subspace communications, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and unforeseen gravitational anomalies.  Though vastly different from Thomas's pilgrimage, the spirit remained the same: the relentless pursuit of a distant horizon, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, and the unshakeable human desire to explore the vast unknown, be it across a continent or a galaxy.
