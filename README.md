
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Ardennes forest, wound ever deeper into the unknown.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge.  Every rustle of leaves, every shadow cast by the ancient oaks, held the promise of peril – bandits, wild beasts, or perhaps something far more sinister lurking in the heart of the woods.  Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the gnawing fear of never reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, pressed in on her.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with unpredictable anomalies, and pirate raids were a constant threat. The loneliness of interstellar travel was a heavy burden, but the thought of the colonists, stranded and vulnerable, fueled her determination to reach her destination safely, a tiny speck of hope in the unimaginable expanse of the cosmos.
