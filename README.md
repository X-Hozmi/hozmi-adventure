
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant abbey rumored to hold the cure for the creeping plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel – a gamble with bandits, starvation, and the elements themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for human colonization.  The journey was fraught with its own dangers – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien lifeforms. Yet, the boundless wonder of space, the promise of discovery and expansion, fueled her unwavering spirit and the intrepid crew under her command.
