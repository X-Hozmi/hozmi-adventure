
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and disease stalked the crowded roads.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the sacred city, the camaraderie with fellow travelers, and the sheer thrill of the unknown spurred them onward, their hearts pounding with the rhythm of their weary horses' hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with its own dangers.  Uncharted cosmic storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, and the vast emptiness of space held the constant, chilling possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien life. Yet, the insatiable human thirst for discovery, the promise of finding new worlds and civilizations, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of known space fueled her determination,  a modern-day knight errant navigating the cosmos.
