
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the French countryside.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray I'd left behind at the coast.  Every creak of the cart, every rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for banditry or worse, yet the thrill of the unknown spurred me onward.  My quest, a rumored lost scroll promising untold knowledge, felt worth the risks, even as hunger gnawed and exhaustion threatened to overwhelm me.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Unlike the medieval roads, this journey was silent, save for the low thrum of the ship and the murmur of my crew.  Instead of bandits, we faced the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The quest was different too—a legendary artifact said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize far more precious than any ancient scroll.  But the sense of adventure, the exhilaration of facing the unknown, remained the same, a timeless echo across the vast gulf of time.
