
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the packhorse behind, a tempting prize for the bandits that plagued the road to Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him; the journey was fraught with peril, a constant test of courage and endurance, but the thrill of the unknown spurred him on.  He dreamt not of comfort, but of reaching his destination, and proving his worth.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of hums and clicks from the ship's complex systems, a stark contrast to the silence of space, broken only by the crackle of the comms and the occasional meteor shower.  The risks were different – radiation storms, gravitational anomalies, unknown alien life – but the spirit of adventure, the insatiable human curiosity to explore the uncharted cosmos, burned as brightly as it had in the age of knights and horses.
