
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Ardennes forest, was treacherous.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the growing tension –  were they bandits, or something far worse lurking in the shadows? His quest: to reach the rumored lost monastery of St. Jude, a perilous journey fueled by faith, the promise of ancient texts, and a desperate need to escape the encroaching plague that ravaged his homeland.

Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony teetering on the brink of disaster.  The jump to hyperspace had been brutal, the gravitational stresses nearly tearing the ship apart. But the galaxy’s vastness held both wonder and peril.  Pirate incursions, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien species made each star system a gamble, a testament to the courageous souls who dared to explore the infinite cosmos.
