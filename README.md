
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a battle against the biting wind that whipped across the desolate plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier between me and my destination – the mythical city of Zerzura.  My meager supplies dwindled, my companions' spirits even more so, yet the lure of untold riches and forgotten magic fueled our weary legs. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – or perhaps, unimaginable reward.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, soothing thrum against the backdrop of the infinite cosmos.  My mission: to retrieve the Xylos artifact from the uncharted nebula of Xylos Prime, a journey spanning light-years and perilous asteroid fields.  The crew, a ragtag bunch of seasoned explorers and ambitious rookies, relied on each other's skill and courage as we navigated wormholes, evaded space pirates, and battled the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation. The galaxy stretched before us, a tapestry of unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, each jump a leap into the very heart of the unknown.
