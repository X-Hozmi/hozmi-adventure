
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Each creak of her saddle, each strained breath of her aging mount, mirrored the anxieties churning within her.  Her quest – to reach the legendary lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague – was a gamble against the odds.  Bandits, starvation, and the relentless expanse of wilderness were her constant companions, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, pushing her to endure the unforgiving realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant lullaby, punctuated only by the crackling of comms and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational forces.  Unlike medieval travellers, Eva’s challenges were cosmic in scale, demanding not just courage but cutting-edge technology and an unwavering resolve to confront the unimaginable vastness of space.
