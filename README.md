
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hung in the air, a stark contrast to the stench of the war-torn village she'd left behind.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both danger and discovery in this untamed land. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown were constant companions on her arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr Empire, Ryla relied on her crew's skill and the ship's cutting-edge technology.  The vastness of space, with its breathtaking cosmic wonders and deadly threats, was a far cry from the medieval journeys of her ancestors, yet the spirit of adventure – the relentless pursuit of the unknown – burned just as brightly within her.
