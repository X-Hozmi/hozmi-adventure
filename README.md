
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But with every river crossed, every village reached, the thrill of discovery fueled my journey across the vast expanse of Europe.  My quest, to find the lost city of Ys, drove me onward, a flickering candle against the darkness of the unknown.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped across the Andromeda galaxy.  The swirling nebulae outside were breathtaking, a canvas of cosmic dust and vibrant colours unlike anything found on Earth. Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different – hostile alien lifeforms, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of system failure – but the insatiable human thirst for exploration burned as brightly as ever, guiding us through the inky blackness towards the furthest reaches of space.
