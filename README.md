
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

But Elara, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, trusted her instincts and her crew, knowing that the survival of a whole planet rested on their shoulders.
