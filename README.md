
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a potent cocktail of terror and exhilaration fueling her relentless journey to the mythical city of Ys. This quest, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, promised both untold riches and unimaginable peril.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship's sensors registered a gravitational anomaly.  Ahead lay the uncharted Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to harbor a new form of hyperdrive technology.  The journey had already claimed lives and tested the crew's limits, but the promise of faster-than-light travel, of bridging the seemingly infinite expanse of space, spurred them onward. The vast, silent beauty of the cosmos, however breathtaking, held an ever-present danger; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the unknown threats lurking in the unmapped reaches of the galaxy.
