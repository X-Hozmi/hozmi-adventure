
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered legends, was her only guide to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the gnawing fear and the burning hope that fueled her perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the wild were constant companions on her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth, where a rumored energy source could save humanity from an impending energy crisis.  The jump through hyperspace was always a gamble – a chaotic ballet of swirling colours and potentially catastrophic malfunctions.  But the stakes were higher than ever; the fate of billions rested on his shoulders, a weight heavier than any asteroid field he'd ever navigated.
