
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura – a journey fraught with peril, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held a potential for both excitement and deadly consequence.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her navigation console.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and requiring the precise navigation of treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both the promise of discovery and the chilling reality of ultimate isolation.
