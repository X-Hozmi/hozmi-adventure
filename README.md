
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager sustenance in hushed villages.  But the glint of distant spires, the whispered tales of Jerusalem, fueled her weary steps, promising a reward beyond the hardships endured.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, unknowable expanse, yet the allure of discovery, of charting the cosmos, propelled her onward, towards the unmapped stars.
