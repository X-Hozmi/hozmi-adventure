
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand leagues, spurred his destrier onward.  The biting wind whipped at his face, a constant companion on his arduous journey across the fractured lands of the Holy Roman Empire.  He carried with him a king's ransom in gold, a desperate plea from a besieged monastery, and the weight of a secret vow whispered under a blood-red moon. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were merely hurdles in his quest.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of space pirates were routine hazards.  Elara, a seasoned veteran, felt the familiar thrill of exploration mixed with the underlying tension of a mission fraught with both scientific discovery and the potential for unimaginable catastrophe.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of untold riches and unimaginable dangers.
