
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset the agonizing knowledge that Zerzura, if it even existed, remained tantalizingly out of reach.  He travelled with only a worn map, a trusty sword, and the unwavering hope that fueled his perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  Her crew, a diverse band of specialists, relied on cutting-edge technology and unwavering courage to navigate this perilous expanse, pushing the boundaries of human exploration further than ever before.
