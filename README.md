
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Their journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was proving far more difficult than the maps suggested.  Bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation dogged their steps as Elara pursued the legendary Sunstone, a relic said to hold the power to heal her ailing village.  Each crest scaled, each valley crossed, brought them closer to their goal, but also closer to the edge of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope's End*, lost amidst the swirling chaos of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were just part of the routine, but the unsettling silence from *Hope's End* was a chilling constant. The vast, unknowable expanse of space pressed in, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of Earth, but the hope of finding survivors pushed Ryla and her crew onward into the unknown.
