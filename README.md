
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Black Forest.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, for rumors of brigands and worse things haunted these woods.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril and the promise of untold riches – or a gruesome end.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, his only guide through the labyrinthine wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey, a months-long odyssey across the vast interstellar gulf, was punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the occasional meteor shower.  But the true challenge lay in the unknown – the alien landscapes, the potential for hostile lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light-years from any rescue.  The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the danger.
