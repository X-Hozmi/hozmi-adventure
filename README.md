
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her weathered face.  Her journey across the vast, unforgiving plains of Francia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys fueled her onward, a beacon of adventure amidst the hardship and uncertainty.  The whispers of ancient magic and untold riches spurred her onward, a counterpoint to the gnawing hunger and bone-deep weariness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast cosmic distances separated her from her home planet, Aethel, but the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risk.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and rogue asteroids.  Her mission: to chart unexplored star systems and search for habitable planets, a quest far removed from the dusty trails of medieval times, yet fueled by the same indomitable spirit of adventure that drove Elara across the plains of Francia.
