
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a half-finished manuscript.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, whispers of a hidden monastery holding ancient secrets, or perhaps the chance encounter with a wandering knight.  The journey itself was the adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship, beauty, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, a stark contrast to the sheltered life she'd left behind.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  While lacking the immediate physical danger of medieval travel, the risks were different – unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life, hostile or otherwise.  The vastness of space was a terrifying and exhilarating playground, where every jump to hyperspace held the promise of discovery, danger, and the thrilling uncertainty of the next frontier.
