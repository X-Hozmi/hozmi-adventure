
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains a fiery orange.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whisperwind Pass, rumored to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged King Alaric, a journey fraught with peril, but one she would undertake for the safety of her people, braving not only the harsh terrain but also the uncertainty of human cruelty. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both breathtaking beauty and imminent danger.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of countless stars painted a breathtaking backdrop to their interstellar voyage.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey across galaxies, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes. Advanced technology shielded them from the cosmic dangers, but the vastness of space, the isolation, and the unknown threats lurking in the dark corners of the universe still filled them with a sense of awe and palpable fear.  The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the risks.
