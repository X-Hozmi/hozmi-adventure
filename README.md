
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Saragossa before winter’s grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where every journey was an adventure, fraught with both peril and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent vastness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards, but the true adventure lay in the unknown – the possibility of discovering new life, new technologies, or even uncovering the secrets of the ancient galactic civilizations whose ruins whispered promises of untold power and knowledge.
