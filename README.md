
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her destrier across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, famine, or worse – a brush with the dreaded Black Death.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril, yet fueled by unwavering faith and the allure of the unknown.  The camaraderie of fellow travelers, the kindness of strangers in humble villages, and the breathtaking beauty of untamed landscapes offer moments of respite amidst the constant threat.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Faster-than-light travel is routine, but the dangers are no less real:  uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Her mission, a perilous search for a lost colony on the edge of known space, demands courage, precision, and an unwavering reliance on her crew.  The breathtaking vistas of nebulas and distant galaxies offer a beauty as vast and awe-inspiring as the medieval plains, but the stakes are cosmically higher.
