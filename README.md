
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, but the lure of the fabled Sunstone, hidden within the lost city of Eldoria, spurred her onward. The journey was arduous, but the promise of discovery burned brighter than any hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a veteran of countless hyperspace jumps, shuddered slightly as it prepared for the warp.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were astronomical—uncharted nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of the Kryll raiders—but the potential rewards far outweighed the peril.  The cosmos held its breath as the *Stardust Drifter* vanished into the inky black.
