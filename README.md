
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days blurred into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to overcome him.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, the promise of something beyond the ordinary, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against the ever-present threat of space pirates and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  The vast distances were punctuated by the eerie silence of deep space, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling static of her comms system.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed on, driven by a sense of duty and the faint hope of finding survivors amidst the cosmic expanse.
