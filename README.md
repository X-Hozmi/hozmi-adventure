
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  The whispered promise of El Dorado, a city of gold lost to the ages, fueled her relentless journey.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for both peril and wonder. Bandits, famine, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant companions on this arduous trek, but the lure of the unknown kept her spirit strong, pushing her ever closer to her mythical goal.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Razor' Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies for the United Galactic Federation.  The vast distances between star systems were measured not in miles, but in light-years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and hostile alien races.  The rewards, however – new worlds, unimaginable resources, and the expansion of human knowledge – were worth the inherent risks of galactic exploration.
