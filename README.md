
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her horse picks its way through the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath of her mount, is a testament to the arduous journey from her homeland to the mythical city of Seraphina.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of the ancient forests, and hunger gnaws at the edges of their meager supplies, but the lure of Seraphina's rumored healing waters, and the whispered tales of its lost magic, push her onward.  The vast, unpredictable landscape is a constant challenge, testing her resilience and pushing her to the limits of her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, holds its own dangers.  Rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demand constant vigilance.  Yet, the potential discovery of new life, and the promise of expanding human civilization across the stars, fuel her unwavering determination to conquer the infinite frontier.
