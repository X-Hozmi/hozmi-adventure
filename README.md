
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the legendary city of Eldoria, had tested their mettle beyond measure.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing threat of starvation had thinned their ranks.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria's mythical healing waters, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  The creak of their worn leather saddles and the rhythmic clop of their horses' hooves were the only sounds louder than the wind's mournful song.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the roadmap. Captain Elara, at the helm of the 'Stardust Drifter', navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos system, her eyes glued to the galaxy-spanning navigation array.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship's hull as they jumped between star systems, chasing a whisper of an ancient civilization said to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. Each jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space-time itself, but the allure of discovering a lost empire pushed them forward, into the vast, uncharted darkness between the glittering pinpricks of light.
