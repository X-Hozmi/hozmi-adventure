The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the whispering pines, leading him ever deeper into the untamed wilds.  He carried with him the King's missive, a perilous journey to secure an alliance with a remote highland clan, a quest fraught with the dangers of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.
