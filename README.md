His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the whispered tales of Zerzura's magnificence, and the love for his sister, fueled his weary steps, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the medieval world.

Yet, the weight of responsibility for the Kepler colonists, and the thrill of galactic exploration, spurred her on, pushing her spacecraft across the vast emptiness between worlds.
