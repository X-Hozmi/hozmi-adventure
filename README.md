Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, the breathtaking landscapes, and the whispered legends of saints and miracles spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of a new adventure, a new challenge overcome.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rendar navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Interplanetary travel was commonplace, but the Xylos run was notoriously dangerous, a gauntlet of asteroid fields and unpredictable gravitational currents.  The reward, however – a rare mineral vital to galactic trade – was worth the risk.  His crew, a motley bunch of seasoned spacers, relied on each other's skills and quick thinking to navigate the treacherous expanse, each successful jump a testament to their bravery and skill.
