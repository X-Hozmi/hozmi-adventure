
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in the dust of a thousand miles, trudged onward. The rough-hewn cart, laden with meager supplies and even more meager hopes, creaked a mournful protest with every jolt over the uneven track.  Bandit raids, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease haunted our journey across the unforgiving landscape, yet the lure of the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the land's blight, spurred us onward. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a precarious victory against the elements and the unknown.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highway.  The sleek, obsidian hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cut through the inky blackness, the faint glow of nebulae painting ephemeral masterpieces across the viewport. Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony demanded skill and nerve, but the promise of galactic exploration, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, far outweighed the inherent risks. The universe, vast and terrifying, was also breathtakingly beautiful, a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities that lay ahead.
