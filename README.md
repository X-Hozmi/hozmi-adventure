
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that danced in the fading light.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and resolute spirits, pushing them ever closer to their unknown destiny.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the enigmatic K'tharr Hegemony, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with interstellar hazards.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien technologies were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space held both incredible beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the promise of galactic commerce and interstellar diplomacy spurred them onward, charting a course into the unmapped reaches of the cosmos.
