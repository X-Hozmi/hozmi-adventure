
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each step, spurred his destrier onward. The sun beat down on the dusty track leading towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispering tales of monstrous beasts kept his heart pounding.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the lure of Eldoria’s fabled riches and forgotten magic spurred him onwards, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and constantly battling the wear and tear of traversing light-years was a daily reality.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas, but also held the chilling possibility of encountering the uncharted, the alien, the potentially hostile.  The journey itself was an adventure as grand as any medieval quest, a test of skill, courage, and the ship's dwindling fuel supply.
