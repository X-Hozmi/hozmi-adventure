
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the caravan as it lumbered across the sun-baked plains, the creak of wagon wheels a mournful counterpoint to the braying of donkeys.  Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming dully in the harsh light, squinted at the horizon.  Rumours of a lost city, glittering with gold and ancient magic, spurred him onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown. Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers, and facing the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of adventure fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian artifact, a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  The journey was fraught with peril – navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate attacks, and facing the ever-present threat of warp storms that could tear her ship apart.  Unlike the medieval adventurers of old, she had advanced technology, but the vastness of space presented its own unique brand of terrifying unknowns. The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the risk.
