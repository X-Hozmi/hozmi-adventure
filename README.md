He squinted towards the horizon, a tapestry of golden wheat fields and emerald forests stretching out before him. Rumors of a lost city, rumored to hold untold riches and a powerful artifact, had drawn him from his manor. The journey was long and arduous, fraught with treacherous bandits and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.

The galaxy, a boundless playground of possibilities, beckoned them with its secrets, and Valerius, at the helm of this interstellar vessel, was determined to unravel them.
