
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the setting sun painting the endless fields of Burgundy a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her family, the seed of a new life across the treacherous mountain passes and into the rumored fertile valleys of the south.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the unpredictable whims of nature itself.  Survival demands constant vigilance and unwavering determination on this medieval pilgrimage.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole network connecting disparate star systems.  The thrill isn't just in the breathtaking nebulae and unexplored planets, but in the constant challenge of navigating unpredictable spatial anomalies and potential encounters with unknown alien lifeforms.  Each jump across the vast emptiness of space is a gamble, a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable thirst for discovery that transcends time.
