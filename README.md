
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked trail.  Her mule, laden with meager supplies, struggled with each uneven step.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey from the ravaged fields of France to the rumored sanctuary of Constantinople.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the hope of finding a new life fueled her weary legs.  The whispering wind carried the scent of woodsmoke and distant storms, a soundtrack to her perilous pilgrimage across a continent teetering on the brink of chaos.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from her home planet. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were everyday occurrences, the vast emptiness of space a stark contrast to the crowded, bustling spaceports.  The hum of the hyperdrive engines and the crackle of the comms system were the only constants in the endless voyage between star systems, a journey fueled by the promise of a new beginning for humanity amongst the stars.
