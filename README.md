
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the bleak landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both danger and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and treacherous terrain all stood between her and her goal.  The journey was arduous, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations even with their advanced technology.  The vastness of space, the constant threat of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, and the isolation of deep space travel tested her crew's resilience.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering new life and worlds, propelled them forward, a tiny ship against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.
