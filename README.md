He squinted towards the horizon, where the crumbling walls of the ancient city of Elyria shimmered in the heat. Legends whispered of forgotten treasures hidden within its depths, and Gareth, driven by a thirst for glory and riches, had chosen to venture into the perilous heart of the forgotten kingdom.
