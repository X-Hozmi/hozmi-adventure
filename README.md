
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's mule plodded onward, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the fleeting comfort of a meager campsite under a vast, indifferent sky.  Her quest, to find a lost brother, fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of a dying star painting their starship's hull in hues of blood orange.  Their mission, a desperate search for a habitable planet, spanned light-years and involved perilous jumps through wormholes, each a gamble against the crushing forces of space-time.  Jax stared out at the cosmos, the breathtaking beauty a stark contrast to the mechanical hum of the ship and the weight of responsibility resting on her shoulders – the fate of her crew, and potentially a whole civilization, depended on the success of this impossible voyage.
