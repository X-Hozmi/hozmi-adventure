
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onwards.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, a tapestry of green and shadow.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – brigands, wild animals, or perhaps something far more sinister.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Every league was a gamble, a test of endurance and courage in a world where the only map was the ever-changing landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate incursions were daily hazards; the vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of her ship, tested her resolve.  The allure of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her relentless journey – a voyage across the cosmic ocean, fraught with danger, yet infinitely rewarding.
