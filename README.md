
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she crested the hill, the sprawling landscape of the French countryside stretching before her like a rumpled green tapestry.  Her destination:  the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Armed with a worn map, a loyal steed, and a heart brimming with both fear and excitement, she began her perilous journey, knowing that bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague could easily claim her before she reached her goal.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through his bones as he navigated asteroid fields and dodged the stray energy pulses of rogue K'tharr warships.  This was no mere trade run; this was exploration at its most daring, a race against time and unknown dangers in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  The fate of humanity, or perhaps even the discovery of new life, hung in the balance.
