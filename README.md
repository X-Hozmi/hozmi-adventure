
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promised riches in the fabled city of  Zarahemla, but the path was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept her ever vigilant. Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing her strength, resilience, and the unwavering loyalty of her small band of companions.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and camaraderie, a testament to human endurance in a world both breathtaking and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her hyperspace drive.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with the dangers of unmapped gravitational fields, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters. The vastness of space was a terrifying and wondrous landscape, filled with celestial wonders and the chilling possibility of loneliness.  Each jump to warp speed was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, propelled by the unwavering human spirit of discovery.
