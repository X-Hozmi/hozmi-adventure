
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages. The journey was perilous, testing their courage and their loyalty, but the promise of Eldoria spurred them onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were their highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, sought out new worlds, charting unknown nebulae and analyzing alien ecosystems.  The journey demanded precision and unwavering vigilance, the vastness of space a constant reminder of both the incredible beauty and the terrifying potential for disaster lurking just beyond the reach of their sensors.
