
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, his destination the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and unimaginable magic.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present fear of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him on, each step a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across lightyears towards the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense distances and unknown dangers she faced.  Pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony were a constant threat, and navigating treacherous asteroid fields demanded pinpoint precision.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, charting unmapped star systems, and encountering alien civilizations fueled her daring journey, a quest as thrilling and perilous as any medieval knight's.
