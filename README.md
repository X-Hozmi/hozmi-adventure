
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth’s worn boots as he urged his mount onward, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of a powerful artifact. The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his strength and resolve, and the whispers of plague stalked the land. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable nature of man.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology capable of warping spacetime.  Asteroid fields posed constant threats, wormholes spat her ship into unknown regions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested her crew's mettle. Unlike Gareth's earthly struggles, Eva faced the terrifying beauty and indifferent vastness of the cosmos, where the unknown stretched infinitely further than any medieval horizon.
