
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through a primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unknown lurked in the shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict research station orbiting the gas giant, a mission fraught with the dangers of volatile stellar winds and the unpredictable behaviour of Xylos's sentient fungal lifeforms.  The vastness of space, peppered with the shimmering lights of distant galaxies, held an intoxicating allure, a constant reminder of the boundless opportunities, and the infinite threats, that lay ahead.
