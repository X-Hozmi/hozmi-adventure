
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onwards.  The trail snaked through a dense forest, shadows long and menacing in the late afternoon sun.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and promise, a constant dance between fear and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.  He carried with him not only his sword, but the hope of a kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reminder of the vast, uncharted distances she traversed.  The shimmering cosmic dust, alien constellations, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown lifeforms, fueled her insatiable wanderlust.  The galaxy was her playground, and the unknown, her siren song.
