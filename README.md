The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous – towering castles perched precariously on cliffs, dense forests teeming with unseen dangers, and rivers swollen with spring melt.

Cosmic storms raged, alien leviathans lurked in the inky blackness, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders haunted their hyperspace jumps. Yet, the lure of discovery and the potential to change the fate of humankind pushed her relentlessly forward.
