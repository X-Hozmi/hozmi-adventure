
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunken City of Ys, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests.  Each day brought fresh challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous terrain testing their mounts, and the gnawing uncertainty of their quest. Yet, the glint of the rumored city’s gold, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling fluctuating wormhole currents were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic courier.  The vastness of space held breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the knowledge that her cargo could mean life or death for an entire planet fueled her courage and propelled her onward across the cosmos.
