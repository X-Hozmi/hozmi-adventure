
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, fueled a mixture of excitement and dread.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant threats, but the lure of the unknown propelled him across the vast, uncharted territories of the Holy Roman Empire and beyond.  He was a pilgrim, a trader, a seeker – a medieval adventurer forging his own destiny.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere orbiting a distant star, a relic of a long-vanished civilization.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space, relying on cutting-edge technology and unwavering courage. The vast emptiness between stars held both wonder and peril, a silent testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the cosmos.  This was interstellar exploration, a new frontier for a new age of adventurers.
