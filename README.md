
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the creak of leather and the rhythmic thud of hooves his only companions.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Each dawn brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, the promise of salvation, fueled his weary body and resolute spirit, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the continent.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's desperate exodus from an Earth ravaged by climate collapse.  The journey was a lonely odyssey punctuated by the hum of the engines and the sterile glow of the control panel.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling cosmic storms, and encountering bizarre alien phenomena were all in a day's work. Yet, the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning for her species, spurred her onward, a solitary beacon in the infinite darkness.
