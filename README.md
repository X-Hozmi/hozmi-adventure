
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her loyal destrier, a sturdy palfrey named Comet, struggling to maintain pace.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in taverns and sung by wandering bards – a city of gold and untold riches.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the lure of legend, the hope of fortune, drives her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance pilots her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the black.  But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories and possibly finding life beyond Earth, fuels her unwavering spirit. The cosmos is her ocean, and she, its intrepid explorer.
