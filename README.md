
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on her sun-scorched face.  Her journey across the unforgiving plains of Aragon was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step. Yet, the allure of the legendary Sunstone, hidden deep within the mystical mountains to the east, fueled her relentless pursuit, a beacon in the desolate landscape. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the dry grass, held the thrill of discovery and the chilling possibility of doom.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of colors and celestial bodies, was both her highway and her hunting ground.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp jump centuries prior.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the potential for encountering hostile alien species or the crushing emptiness of space itself. Yet, the promise of finding Aethel, of reuniting a lost civilization, propelled her forward, a solitary star in the vast expanse.
