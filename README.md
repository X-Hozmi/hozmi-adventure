
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from over; rumours of a lost city, shimmering with untold riches, fueled her relentless trek.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were mere inconveniences compared to the lure of untold secrets nestled within those jagged peaks. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold reward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, a region teeming with potential new worlds and terrifying cosmic phenomena.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unknown – ancient alien ruins, sentient energy storms, and the chilling whispers of civilizations lost to time.  The vast expanse of space held the promise of breathtaking discovery, but the cost of failure was annihilation.
