
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small company pressed onward. Their worn leather boots crunched on frozen ground, each step a testament to their arduous journey.  They rode towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their quest, to find a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland, pushed them relentlessly forward, their courage a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship lurched through a sudden gravitational eddy.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of collapse.  Vast distances and unpredictable celestial phenomena were but minor inconveniences compared to the threat of pirate raiders and the ever-present danger of system failure – in the vast expanse of space, survival was an ongoing adventure.
