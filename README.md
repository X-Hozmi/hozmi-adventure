
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a shimmering tapestry of camels, horses, and weary men, crawls across the scorching sands of the Arabian Desert.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, while the relentless sun beats down, threatening to boil our meager water supplies.  Yet, the allure of the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, fuels our onward journey. The promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge outweighs the ever-present danger, pushing us further into the heart of the unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The colossal 'Starseeker' vessel, a marvel of intergalactic engineering, carries me across the void between spiral galaxies.  My mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate colony fleeing a dying world.  The vastness of space is a breathtaking terror; nebulae paint canvases of unimaginable beauty while the looming threat of cosmic storms and unpredictable wormholes constantly test the limits of our technology and courage.  The survival of my people rests on this arduous journey among the stars.
