
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Elara's small band of travelers trudged onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of  Saint Alba, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  rivers swelled with the spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to their resilience, a testament to their unwavering hope for salvation found in the distant, mythical springs.

Conversely, millennia later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years away, was measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hyperspace travel.  The crew faced technological malfunctions, the constant threat of space debris, and the chilling isolation of deep space. Yet, fueled by the promise of discovery and the possibility of finding a new home for humanity, they pressed on, their vessel a lone beacon of hope in the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
