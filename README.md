
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees were less daunting than the rumour of the lost city of Eldoria, a fabled place said to hold the key to her family's ancient lineage. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat or a tantalizing clue, transforming the mundane journey into a breathless chase across the tapestry of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the celestial echoes of ancient quasars, she and her crew sought the mythical Xylos Cluster, a region whispered to contain planets teeming with life unlike any seen before.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the silence of space, but the thrill of discovery – the potential for wondrous new worlds and equally perilous encounters – vibrated through every atom of the ship, a cosmic adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers.
