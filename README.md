
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a constant companion on his journey from the besieged city of Calais to the rumored sanctuary of Avignon.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, marked a fleeting moment in a perilous odyssey across a land rife with bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of war.  The shimmering promise of safety lay ahead, but the road itself was an adventure both thrilling and terrifying.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, reassuring drone amidst the breathtaking cosmic canvas outside her viewport.  While the dangers were less immediate – bandits replaced by rogue asteroids, disease by radiation – the journey was no less arduous.  Navigation through treacherous gravitational fields and the ever-present risk of system failures kept her senses sharp, transforming the interstellar void into a breathtaking and hazardous adventure.
