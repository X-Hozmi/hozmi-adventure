
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the hope flickering in her heart, spurred her onward across the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The vastness of space, the potential for encountering alien civilizations – both friendly and hostile – and the constant threat of equipment malfunctions presented challenges far exceeding any medieval journey.  But the promise of discovery, of a new beginning for her species, fueled her voyage across the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
