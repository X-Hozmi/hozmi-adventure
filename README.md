
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a pittance compared to the fortune she sought in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of every crumbling ruin, and the whisper of the Black Death clung to the wind, a constant companion on her perilous journey. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers and unexpected encounters, a tapestry woven with hardship, breathtaking landscapes, and the enduring hope of reaching her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Theron piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Raiders, Ryla relied on her wits, her loyal crew, and the cutting-edge technology of her vessel. The vast expanse of space, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders and deadly threats, held both the promise of discovery and the terrifying uncertainty of the unknown.
