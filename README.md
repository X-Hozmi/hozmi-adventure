
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of oxen, pack mules, and weary travelers, inches across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts.  Each creak of a wagon wheel, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, holds the potential for bandits, scorching heatstroke, or worse – the whispers of djinn and desert spirits that haunt these forgotten lands.  Our quest for legendary spices and untold riches is tested daily by the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship powered by harnessed nebulae, cuts through the swirling cosmos towards Kepler-186f.  Our mission: to establish the first human colony on this potentially habitable exoplanet.  The vast, inky blackness punctuated by nebulae ablaze with colors unseen on Earth holds both wonder and peril.  Cosmic storms threaten to tear our ship apart, while the alien flora and fauna of Kepler-186f remain largely uncharted, promising both breathtaking discovery and the very real possibility of extinction.
