
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the scent of pine and damp earth a welcome respite from the grit clinging to his throat.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests haunted by bandits, and across plains vast enough to swallow a kingdom whole. Each sunrise brought new peril, each sunset a hard-earned victory, forging him into a legend whispered around crackling campfires.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on interstellar trade routes.  But the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, burned brighter than any danger, fueling her unwavering determination to reach her destination.
