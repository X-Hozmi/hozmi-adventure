
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary oxen onward.  The sun beat down on her leather armor, a stark contrast to the chill wind whistling through the skeletal branches of the ancient forest.  Each creak of the wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving deserts, and the ever-present threat of war – but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond the known galaxy.  The ship's AI, a calm voice in the echoing silence of space, charted a course through asteroid fields and navigated the treacherous gravitational pull of dying stars.  Unlike Elara's journey, Eva's challenges weren't bandits and wild beasts, but cosmic radiation, malfunctioning engines, and the unnerving vastness of the universe itself.  Yet, the same burning desire – to achieve the impossible – propelled them both.
