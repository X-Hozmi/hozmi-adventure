
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and discovery.  Bandits, storms, and the ever-present hunger were constant companions on this arduous journey across a continent riven by war and rumour.  The path ahead remained uncertain, a tapestry woven with hope and fear in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of colours unseen by human eyes before.  Her mission: to establish contact with a newly discovered sentient species on the far side of the galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant suns, held a different kind of peril—the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, the threat of pirates lurking in the shadows, and the ever-present fear of encountering something utterly alien and hostile.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, propelled her forward, a tiny ship on an ocean of stars.
