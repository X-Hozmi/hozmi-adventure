
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword heavy, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track barely deserved the name, winding through a landscape of brooding forests and treacherous bogs. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving terrain of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the newly discovered Xylos system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems under the watchful gaze of alien sentinels were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless unknowns, but the promise of intergalactic commerce and the exploration of new worlds spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the cosmos.
