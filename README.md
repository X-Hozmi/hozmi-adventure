
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura’s shimmering spires and healing waters fueled his relentless journey, a solitary speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull shimmering under the alien light of the Xylos nebula.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable planets for a desperately overcrowded Earth.  The vast distances were a constant challenge, punctuated by the thrill of discovering new worlds, each a tapestry of strange landscapes and potentially hostile lifeforms.  The loneliness of space was profound, yet the promise of a future for humanity spurred Eva and her crew onwards, brave pioneers charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
