
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey ahead.  The chill wind whipped across the vast plains of France, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and the distant cries of hawks.  My destination: the mythical city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Rumors of its untold riches and powerful magic fueled my quest, a dangerous gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the plague. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tinged with the knowledge that death could lurk around any bend in the road.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity, a jewel nestled in a distant star system.  The vast expanse of space, a tapestry of nebulae and shimmering stars, stretched out before my ship.  Instead of bandits and disease, we faced the perils of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien life.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to build a future among the stars, outweighed the danger, forging in me a courage as fierce and unwavering as any medieval knight.
