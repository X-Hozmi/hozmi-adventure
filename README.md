
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary mounts, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance in the shimmering heat, mocking our slow progress towards the mythical city of Samarkand.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of disease. Yet, the allure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, fuels our relentless journey, a perilous pilgrimage across a world brimming with both beauty and brutality.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cuts a shimmering path through the nebula of Cygnus X-1.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a breathtaking leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  We seek the legendary Xylos system, whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a prize worth risking the dangers of uncharted space, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters. The universe, vast and unknowable, beckons.
