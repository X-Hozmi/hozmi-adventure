
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of its shimmering spires and lost knowledge spurred her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was commonplace; the vast emptiness of space, however, was a constant companion, a stark reminder of the fragility of life amidst the infinite.  The glittering tapestry of galaxies outside her viewport, though breathtaking, held little comfort compared to the warmth of human connection, a commodity as precious as oxygen on a distant world.
