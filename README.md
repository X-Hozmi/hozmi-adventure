
The medieval era, a time of knights and castles, presented a unique challenge for adventurous souls. With limited roads and treacherous terrain, traversing the land was a perilous journey.  The traveler relied on maps, instinct, and the generosity of strangers for survival.  The reward for such perilous journeys was the discovery of new lands, the exchange of knowledge, and the thrill of facing the unknown.  The lure of the road, with its promise of both danger and wonder, was strong, and those who dared to answer its call were forever changed by their experiences. 

In the future, the journey is one of stars and galaxies.  With advanced technology, traversing the vast emptiness of space is now a reality.  Travelers board massive starships, powered by warp drive and antigravity, that can reach distant planets in mere hours.  The destinations are as diverse as they are alluring, with alien worlds teeming with life, ancient ruins shrouded in mystery, and planets teeming with unimaginable resources.  The future traveler embarks on adventures that were only dreamed of in the past, with the promise of discovery and the possibility of making first contact with other sentient lifeforms.
