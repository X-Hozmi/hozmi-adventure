
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone Shrine nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the land from a creeping blight, spurred them on, each sunrise revealing new challenges and breathtaking vistas across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable space storms and the potential for hostile encounters with unknown alien species. Yet,  the vastness of space, studded with celestial wonders, filled Eva with a sense of awe that mirrored the courage she needed to face the unknown.
