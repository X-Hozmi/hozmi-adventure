
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine, not from fear of the elements but of the bandit gangs rumored to prey on lone travelers.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of King Arthur.  The journey, fraught with peril and hardship, promised glory, or oblivion – a gamble worth taking for a knight of his renown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms made every jump through hyperspace a gamble.  Yet, the potential discovery of new worlds and civilizations fueled her unwavering determination, a thirst for the unknown as potent as Sir Reginald's desire for Arthurian glory.
