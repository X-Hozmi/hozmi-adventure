
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already tested their endurance – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from bartering for meager meals in dusty villages to navigating by the stars under a vast, unforgiving sky. Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve strengthened, fueled by faith and the promise of a sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a remote colony on Kepler-186f.  The vast distances between stars demanded precise calculations and unwavering vigilance; navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate ships became commonplace occurrences.  The sheer scale of the cosmos, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes, instilled both awe and a profound sense of isolation. But Eva, like Sir Kaelan before her, found strength in her purpose, knowing that her journey, though fraught with peril, held the potential to save countless lives.
