
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack laden with meager supplies and a heart heavier with worry than with weight.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the ever-present danger.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on her journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  The whispers of the distant sea promised a freedom she desperately sought, a freedom worth risking everything to attain.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was commonplace, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards - a future free from the endless cycle of galactic war - fueled her unwavering determination.
