
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, guides her mule westward.  Ahead lies the whispered-of city of Eldoria, said to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the lure of Eldoria’s mysteries – and the rumored cure for her brother’s wasting sickness – fuels her onward, every creak of the saddle a testament to her unwavering resolve.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience in a world where survival is a daily battle.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the Xylos Nebula in the starship *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, treacherous gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But Eva, a seasoned veteran of countless interstellar voyages, faces the void with unflinching determination.  Her mission: to find a new home for humanity, a testament to the enduring human spirit's boundless quest for exploration and the promise of a future beyond the confines of their dying world.
