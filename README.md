
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses' hooves sinking into the parched earth.  Their journey to the Sultanate of Rum was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins,  rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy.  Yet, the lure of untold riches and the whispered promise of a legendary city fueled their weary steps, each sunrise bringing them closer to the unknown, and a destiny yet unwritten.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Pirate fleets roamed the black between galaxies, wormholes pulsed with unpredictable energies, and the vast emptiness itself held untold mysteries, and the potential for catastrophic failure.  But Elara, fueled by the thirst for discovery and a map promising a lost galactic empire, pushed onward, charting new courses through the uncharted reaches of space.
