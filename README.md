
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost empires.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing breathtaking vistas – snow-capped mountains, sun-drenched valleys teeming with life, and ominous, shadowy forests where whispers of mythical beasts hung heavy in the air.  Each step was fraught with peril: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement vanished centuries ago without a trace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering strange, alien lifeforms were commonplace occurrences.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held dangers far exceeding those of any medieval journey – failing warp drives, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirates.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to uncover the secrets of a lost civilization, fueled her unwavering determination.
