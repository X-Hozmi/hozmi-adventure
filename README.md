
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little more than dried meat, a few precious coins, and a map promising a shortcut to Avignon – a shortcut rumored to be haunted by brigands and guarded by treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the thrill, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lie ahead on this desperate journey to find her lost brother.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The hyperdrive hums a steady, reassuring song, but the journey between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies is fraught with its own perils: rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The reward, however, is the fabled planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – a gamble worth taking, even with the vast, star-strewn emptiness surrounding her.
