
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the midday heat, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a testament to their weeks-long journey across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Bandits were a constant threat, the terrain treacherous, and every ford a gamble. But the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, propelled them ever forward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of their ambition.  Each creak of saddle leather, each stamp of hoof, was a step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Wormholes, treacherous and unpredictable, were their only shortcut across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Alien encounters, both benevolent and hostile, were commonplace.  The mission – to retrieve a vital energy source from a dying star – was fraught with peril, but the potential to save billions outweighed the risks. The hum of the engines and the vast, unknowable cosmos were a constant reminder of the scale of their endeavor.
