
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to possess a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his village.  Every creak of the woods, every rustle in the undergrowth, threatened to reveal bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of starvation or disease, yet the hope of salvation propelled him relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the myriad planets of this unexplored sector.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pulls of dying stars was child's play compared to the unpredictable nature of alien encounters.  With her loyal crew, Eva faced down insectoid raiders, negotiated with sentient plant life, and uncovered ancient secrets hidden within forgotten temples – all in the relentless pursuit of humanity's next frontier.
