
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the sprawling plains of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague haunted every village.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the promise of reaching the fabled city of Constantinople, with its silks and spices and whispered secrets, fueled her onward.  She carried with her not only a worn map and a meager supply of food, but also a fierce spirit, ready to face whatever the medieval world threw her way.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  nebulous storms threatened to tear apart his ship, while pirate factions, far more advanced than any terrestrial navy, patrolled the star lanes.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, yet the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the cosmos – was a siren song that pulled him ever onward, even into the darkest corners of the galaxy.
