
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel. The promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, however, fueled her onward, a burning ember in the heart of a desperate adventurer.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the interstellar navigation system.  His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a journey spanning light years and treacherous wormholes.  Facing down cosmic pirates, navigating asteroid fields, and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Rexx and his crew, their courage and ingenuity the only bulwark against the vast and perilous expanse of the galaxy.
