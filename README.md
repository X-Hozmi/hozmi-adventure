
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tightly.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend, testing her courage and resourcefulness.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones, spurred her onward, a beacon guiding her across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rourke piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours masking the dangers within.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational currents and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Elara's journey, Rexx's was aided by advanced technology, but the vastness of space presented its own unique challenges, a terrifying and exhilarating unknown stretching before him, far beyond the reach of any known map.
