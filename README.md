
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a lost kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to human endurance against a backdrop of rolling hills and ancient forests.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  The cosmos, a breathtaking yet terrifying expanse of dark matter and vibrant celestial bodies, presented its own challenges – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, fueled by the promise of a new dawn for humanity among the stars, she pressed on, her ship a tiny vessel against the immensity of the galaxy.
