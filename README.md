
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a chipped map, a promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – bandits, storms, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the whispered tales of ancient wonders, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby compared to the thrill of charting unmapped nebulae and encountering alien civilizations, each with its unique culture and technology.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate attacks were commonplace hazards, but the potential reward – discovering new planets, new life, and unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos – far outweighed the risks.  The universe, vast and unpredictable, was her playground.
