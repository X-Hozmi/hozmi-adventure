
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track towards the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the relentless heat of the desert, and the gnawing uncertainty of the journey itself.  Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura – a city of gold and untold riches – spurred her onward, alongside her grizzled companions, a band of misfits bound together by a shared thirst for adventure and a hefty dose of desperation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate raiders became second nature. Her crew, a diverse collection of explorers and scientists, worked together to chart unmapped star systems, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace. The thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, outweighed the inherent risks as they pushed the boundaries of human exploration, seeking answers to the universe's oldest mysteries.
