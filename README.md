
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange. Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions – a chipped map, a well-used psalter, and a gnawed bone given to her by a travelling monk for good luck.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and wonder. Bandits, storms, and the sheer unforgiving nature of the landscape were constant companions on her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a journey fueled by faith and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next breakthrough.  The vastness of the cosmos held its own unique dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships preying on lone travellers. Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of charting unmapped galaxies, propelled Jaxx forward, her heart pounding with the rhythm of the hyperdrive's hum.
