
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey from Canterbury to Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the whispered promise of Byzantium, a city of gold and wonders, fueled her onward.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand was her only guide, a lifeline in a world vast and unforgiving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of the cockpit.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, volatile energy fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – the spirit of adventure burned as brightly as ever.  The cosmos, vast and mysterious, held secrets waiting to be unveiled, a siren song only a true explorer could resist.
