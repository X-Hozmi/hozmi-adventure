Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless sun, the gnawing hunger, and the constant threat of bandits and wild beasts. Each creaking wagon wheel, each strained muscle, fueled our desperate hope, a fragile flame flickering against the immensity of the unknown wilderness. The rough-hewn map, its edges frayed and ink faded, was our only guide, promising riches beyond imagining but demanding a price far steeper than any gold.

Conversely, centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking tapestry of the Andromeda Galaxy.

Each hyperspace jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, uncaring expanse of space, a testament to human ambition pushing relentlessly against the boundaries of the known universe.
