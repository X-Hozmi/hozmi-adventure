
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack mules and weary men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air hangs heavy with the scent of dust and distant woodsmoke, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear clinging to us after our brush with bandits in the Black Mountains.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – treacherous river crossings, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of raiders. Yet, with every mile, the allure of Constantinople, its shimmering spires a beacon on the horizon, strengthens our resolve. This journey, fraught with peril, is a pilgrimage to fortune, a quest for spices and silks, a gamble against the harsh realities of a medieval world.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship humming with the quiet thrum of fusion reactors, navigates the inky blackness between galaxies.  My family, born amongst the stars, has never known Earth, only the sterile, recycled air of the vessel.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from our home.  The journey is not perilous in the traditional sense; no marauders or treacherous terrain threaten us.  Instead, the danger lies in the monotony, the isolation, the weight of generations resting on our shoulders, and the unknowable challenges awaiting us on a world we can only speculate about.
