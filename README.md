
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her weathered face.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura before winter’s grip tightened its icy hold.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves, making every league a struggle against the odds, a constant test of endurance and wit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its sensors scanning for habitable planets within the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony, a beacon of humanity flickering at the edge of known space.  The vast emptiness between stars held its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of finding their kin, propelled them forward through the inky blackness, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
