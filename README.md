The rutted track, barely a path through the whispering pines, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Alba, had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed territories of unfriendly barons. Each day brought new challenges – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the allure of Eldoria, and the promise of uncovering its secrets, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, already spanning months, was fraught with its own perils – asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the constant hum of the ship's engines a constant reminder of their fragile position in the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the thought of discovering a new world, of planting humanity's flag on alien soil, outweighed any fear, driving the crew of the *Starseeker* ever closer to their breathtaking goal.
