
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a battle against scorching heat, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Tales of mythical beasts and treacherous terrain fueled their anxieties, yet the whispered promise of salvation and glory kept their weary legs moving. The creak of their armor, the whinny of their horses, and the murmur of prayers formed a constant soundtrack to their perilous adventure across a vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers both organic and technological.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, yet the journey was far from smooth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and skirmishes with space pirates punctuated the voyage, testing the crew's skills and their resolve to succeed in this intergalactic race against time.
