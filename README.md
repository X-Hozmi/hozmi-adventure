
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies – it contains the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, holds the promise of both peril and adventure, a constant test of resilience against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable dangers lurking in every shadow. The journey is a gamble, but the alternative is certain death.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the crimson nebula, the twin suns casting an eerie glow on the obsidian hull of the *Starseeker*.  Their mission: to reach Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond the known galaxies.  The hyperspace jump was treacherous, a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime, but now, amidst the swirling cosmic dust and the distant hum of nebulae, a new kind of adventure unfolds. The cosmos is vast and unforgiving, but the promise of discovery is a potent fuel, propelling them ever onward into the unknown.
