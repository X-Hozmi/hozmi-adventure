
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the known world – each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a prayer for survival.  His only map was a tattered parchment and his guide, a stubborn mule and an unwavering hope.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and untold dangers.  Nebula storms threatened to crush her ship, pirate vessels lurked in the shadows between stars, and the ever-present threat of engine failure loomed large.  Yet, with her loyal crew and advanced technology, Eva pressed onward, her determination fueled by the hope of finding the lost colonists and uncovering the secrets of Xylos' ancient civilization.
