
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara's caravan lumbered onward, the rough-hewn wagons creaking a mournful song.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the harsh desert threatened to swallow them whole.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for supplies in dusty villages, and battling the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a swirling nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a breathtaking distraction from the perilous jump to the Xylos system.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the Galactic Federation's new hyperspace engine, a component hidden on the remote planet of Aethelred, notorious for its unpredictable gravity fields and aggressive sentient flora.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns and the hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of fear than Elara's desert journey, a lonely vastness that tested the limits of courage and ingenuity.
