
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in impoverished villages, and constantly watching their backs against the unpredictable whims of nature and humanity alike.  Yet, the allure of the distant shrine, a beacon of hope in a time of plague and war, pushed them onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in conventional travel.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the silent hum of the ship a constant reminder of their isolation.  Navigation glitches, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks were commonplace.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to map uncharted territories and uncover the secrets of the cosmos, fueled her crew's courage, pushing them further into the inky black of the universe in a quest that dwarfed any earthly adventure.
