
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine, a stark reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked in the shadows.  His quest: to reach the distant Holy City of Jerusalem, a perilous journey fraught with hardship, disease, and the ever-present threat of war.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield, but also the unwavering hope of fulfilling a sacred vow.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a breathtaking spectacle, hid the treacherous currents that threatened to tear her vessel apart. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding both technological prowess and unwavering courage.  The vast expanse of space, while beautiful, was a lonely and dangerous frontier, filled with unknown celestial phenomena and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.
