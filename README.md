The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting wind.  His quest, a perilous journey to the Holy Land to retrieve a sacred relic, had already tested his mettle against bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of the distant sun promised a new day, and with it, the hope of reaching his destination, even if it meant facing the unknown terrors that lay ahead.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through the unpredictable currents of space, the constant hum of the hyperdrive, and the ever-present threat of space debris were commonplace hazards. But the possibility of discovering new life, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her unwavering determination, making the vast emptiness of space a canvas for an adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval knights.
