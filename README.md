
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the promise of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, drives her onward.  The journey is a tapestry woven with the kindness of strangers, the sting of betrayal, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, shaping her into a woman far stronger than she ever believed possible.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck of defiance against the vast cosmic ocean.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the dangers are no less real: rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet struggling against the harsh realities of terraforming.  The journey tests the limits of his ship, his crew, and himself, forcing him to confront the loneliness and the awe-inspiring beauty of space, reminding him of the fragility of life amidst the infinite expanse.
