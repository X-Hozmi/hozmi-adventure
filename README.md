
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, indifferent wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and negotiating treacherous wormholes were commonplace hazards on her trade route between the vibrant, neon-lit city-planets of Xylos and the crystalline ice-worlds of Aethel.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – the thrill of exploration, the challenge of overcoming the impossible, and the unwavering pursuit of her goals mirrored the spirit of those medieval pilgrims.
