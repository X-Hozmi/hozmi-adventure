
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Each sunrise brought a renewed determination, spurred on by the promise of adventure and the hope of glory.

Millennia later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with dangers both natural and artificial.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and repairing critical systems under the relentless gaze of distant suns became the routine of this interstellar odyssey. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed their courage, but the hope of finding their lost brethren fueled their perilous voyage.
