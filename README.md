Their journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send them tumbling to their deaths, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of courage and endurance, as they traversed the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe and beyond, their hope clinging to the promise of Jerusalem.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in generations of cryosleep punctuated by the occasional warp jump, a risky maneuver that brought them hurtling through space-time itself.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos held wonders unseen and dangers unknown; asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every voyage a perilous gamble, fuelled by the indomitable human spirit seeking new horizons among the stars.
