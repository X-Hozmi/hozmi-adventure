
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and impending storm hanging heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the promise of bandits, wild animals, or worse – the gnawing uncertainty of a journey across uncharted territories fueled only by hope and a worn map. The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward far outweighed the risk.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Kestrel piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of halting the encroaching galactic war.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Hegemony, Comet pushed his ship and his crew to their limits.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, the ultimate test of courage and skill in a cosmic race against time.
