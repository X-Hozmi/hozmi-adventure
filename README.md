
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing their courage and resilience as they pressed towards their uncertain destination, their hopes as fragile as the autumn leaves swirling around them.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage through uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself –  a single miscalculation could mean annihilation.  The vastness of the cosmos was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to the boundless expanse of the universe and the courage required to explore its hidden corners.
