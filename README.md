
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resilience, and the constant gnawing hunger threatened to break her spirit.  Yet, the whispered tales of Ys, a city of unimaginable wealth and wonder, fuelled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness. Each day brought new challenges, new landscapes, and a deepening understanding of her own unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable forces of hyperspace.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across a dozen star systems following a catastrophic warp-storm.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying isolation and the exhilarating promise of discovery, each jump a thrilling leap into the unknown, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of nebulae and the silent majesty of distant galaxies.
