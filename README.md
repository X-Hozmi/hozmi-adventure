
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest, each bend promising either ambush or breathtaking vista.  His quest: to reach the rumored city of Ys, a legendary haven said to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the thrill – and the ever-present danger – of his journey across the unforgiving medieval landscape.  He carried not only his sword but the hope of a kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, held a different kind of terror than Reginald's forest.  Radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of engine failure were constant companions. Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her courage and pushed her ever onward across the seemingly infinite expanse of the cosmos.
