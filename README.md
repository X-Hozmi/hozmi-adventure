
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue trudged across the parched Provençal landscape. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of  Serendib, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by ancient maps and whispered legends, spurred them onward, a tapestry of courage and desperation woven into their arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils – wormhole instabilities, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone transports.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding survivors, pushed Eva and her crew through the cosmic void, their journey a thrilling dance between breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger.
