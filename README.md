
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a test of her will and resilience, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving forces of nature.  Zerzura, if it exists, is a distant, shimmering hope on the horizon.

Centuries hence, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet teeming with hostile, bioluminescent flora and guarded by sentient crystal structures.  Warp jumps across vast interstellar distances are punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Rexx relies not on a sturdy steed, but on his wits, his advanced technology, and the loyalty of his crew to survive the dangers of the cosmos and fulfill his mission.
