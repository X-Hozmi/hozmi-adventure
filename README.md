
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, perilous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, yet the vast, unforgiving landscape seemed to stretch endlessly before them, a testament to the risks and rewards of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel had its dangers – unpredictable wormhole collapses, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the void. Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential to uncover new life and knowledge, fueled her crew's tireless efforts, making the unimaginable distances a thrilling, albeit hazardous, journey.
