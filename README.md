
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward across the muddy track.  Each creak of our packhorses’ harnesses, each rustle of leaves in the skeletal trees, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, felt as distant and unreal as the stars themselves, yet the promise of silks, spices, and untold riches fueled our aching limbs and hardened resolve.  Each sunrise painted a new vista of rolling hills and distant mountains, a silent testament to the vastness of the medieval world and the daring of our journey.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves were our pathways.  The Althea, our starship, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy fields, sliced through the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae, vast and breathtaking, provided a fleeting sense of awe amidst the constant hum of the hyperdrive.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unknown entities that lurked in the inky blackness – but the spirit of adventure, the unyielding human thirst to explore the beyond, remained the same.
