The King's writ, a sealed scroll clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches and glory in the distant lands beyond the Black Forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of leaves in the deepening twilight, held the promise of adventure – or peril.

But this journey held a different weight; the hope of humanity's continued survival rested on their shoulders.  The vast, glittering canvas of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, stretched endlessly before them, a constant reminder of the immense scale of their adventure.
