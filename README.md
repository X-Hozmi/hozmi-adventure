
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and hopeful guesses, offered little solace against the looming peaks.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both the beauty and the brutal reality of medieval travel; a constant struggle against nature, bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead.  Her quest for the lost city of Eldoria felt further away with every passing mile, yet the allure of its rumored treasures kept her pushing onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across the vast gulf of space, the journey was a dance with physics and probability; a test of the ship's resilience and her crew's resolve.  The endless expanse, dotted with the shimmering pinpricks of distant stars, held a breathtaking majesty, but also the chilling reminder of the unforgiving nature of the cosmos, where one wrong calculation could mean oblivion.
