
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested both her skill and her mount’s endurance, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-lost research outpost on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was child's play compared to the unpredictable nature of the Xylos currents.  The ship bucked and groaned under the immense pressure, but Eva's steady hand and the crew's unwavering loyalty ensured they pressed on, driven by the hope of discovery and the thrill of charting the uncharted.
