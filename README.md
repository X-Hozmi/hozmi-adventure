
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and exhausted oxen, crawls across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts.  We're bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones, a legendary oasis rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies are our constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of adventure, spurs us onward, each creak of the wagon wheels a testament to our unwavering resolve.


Centuries hence, the Althea, a starship forged of starlight and dreams, leaps across the void.  Its destination: Xylos, a planet veiled in nebulae at the edge of the known galaxy, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes mirroring the cold brilliance of space, steers her crew through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies.  The dangers are no less real; rogue planets, cosmic storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels patrol the interstellar highways, but the potential rewards – unlocking the secrets of the universe – make the peril worthwhile.
