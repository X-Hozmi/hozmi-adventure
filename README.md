
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a potent healing balm for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by sibling love, propelled him across the unforgiving landscape, towards a destiny uncertain but fiercely desired.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of a rival corporation, Eva relied on her wits, her crew's unwavering loyalty, and the advanced technology of her ship.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a perilous expanse, promising both unimaginable rewards and the devastating potential for failure.
