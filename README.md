
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on our backs.  The rough-hewn path, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Our destination:  the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of our saddlebags, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled us forward, fueled by dreams of glory and the thrill of the unpredictable.

Centuries hence, the colossal starship *Odyssey* pierced the inky blackness of space, a tiny beacon against the vast indifference of the cosmos.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with perils unimaginable to our medieval counterparts.  Instead of bandits, we faced nebulae storms and rogue planetoids.  Starvation was replaced by the threat of oxygen deprivation and malfunctioning life support. But the quest for knowledge, the endless expanse of space, and the tantalizing possibility of discovering new life forms, drove us onward into the cosmic unknown.
