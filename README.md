
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the skeletal remains of a long-dead forest stretching to the horizon.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried berries and a chipped map promising riches in the fabled city of Eldoria – a city whispered about in hushed tones, a land of gold and magic said to exist beyond the Serpent's Tooth Mountains.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the unknown.  Eldoria, or death. The choice was stark.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Jaxx relied on ancient sensor technology and a gut feeling honed by years spent charting the uncharted.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of hardship than Elara's journey: loneliness, cosmic radiation, and the chilling possibility of never finding Xylos or returning home.  The stakes were galaxies apart, but the spirit of adventure remained the same.
