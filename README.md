
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to secure a treaty with a distant, rumored-to-be-savage clan.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present uncertainty of the unknown stretched before her like the endless mountain range itself. Survival depended on wit, courage, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, space pirates, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, was a test of both his piloting skills and his crew's resilience. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the most audacious dreams, yet the promise of discovery pushed them onward.
