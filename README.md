
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting whisper against her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the nearby woods, holds the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  The journey is arduous, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding population.  The journey is measured in light-years, not days, the dangers unseen cosmic storms and uncharted nebulae.  Advanced technology provides a measure of safety, but the loneliness of space and the ever-present threat of the unknown demand unwavering courage and a spirit as vast as the cosmos itself.
