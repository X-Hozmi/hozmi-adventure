
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The pilgrimage to Canterbury had become a desperate race against the encroaching plague. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, spoke of the unknown dangers lurking beyond the familiar villages. Bandit raids were common, and rumors of supernatural creatures in the dense forests fueled his already frayed nerves.  Every sunrise brought a renewed sense of dread and a fervent hope for safe passage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and potential sabotage she faced from within her own crew. The vast emptiness of space held a beauty that mirrored the terrifying isolation of her journey, the ultimate test of courage and resilience.
