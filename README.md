
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's decree, a frantic scrawl promising riches and land to whoever delivered the sacred relic to the Pope, burned a hole in his saddlebag. His journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring thaw, and the whispered tales of mythical beasts inhabiting the untamed wilderness chilled him to the bone.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the chilling silence between stars, was a stark contrast to the bustling spaceports she left behind.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a calculated risk against the unknown dangers lurking in the cosmic expanse - rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving void.
