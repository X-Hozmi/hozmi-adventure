
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contained more hope than coin, her destination a whispered rumour of a hidden monastery holding ancient healing texts.  Each creak of her saddle, each wary glance at the shadowed forests, heightened the thrill of the unknown.  Robbers, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the potential reward – a chance to save her ailing brother – fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Roxy" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, Kai, calmly reporting navigation updates.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and potentially lethal alien flora.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking spectacle of celestial bodies, and the constant hum of the ship's engines were a far cry from Elara's medieval trek, yet the same courageous spirit pulsed within Roxy – the relentless pursuit of a goal, the exhilaration of facing the unknown.
