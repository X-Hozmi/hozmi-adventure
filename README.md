
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, dust-caked and sun-beaten, trudged onward, the rough cobblestones a constant reminder of the miles already conquered.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promised both shelter and peril.  Each creak of our overloaded wagons, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit attack, wild beast, or worse – the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume us all before we reached the fabled city of Eldoria. The promise of gold, glory, and a cure for the plague spurred us onward, our resolve tested by every hardship the unforgiving landscape threw our way.

Centuries later, the stars were our cobblestones.  The Althea, a sleek starship shimmering under the cold light of a nebula, jumped across galaxies, each hyperspace transit a thrilling gamble against spatial anomalies. Our mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, potentially bridging the gap between distant civilizations.  The risks were immense: alien predators, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of navigational errors that could strand us in the desolate void. But the lure of discovery, the chance to unlock the universe’s secrets, far outweighed any fear.
