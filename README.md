
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling, and the ever-present fear of disease shadowed every step. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's ancient magic spurred her on, a beacon in the gathering gloom, promising untold riches and adventure beyond her wildest dreams.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colors, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and stellar winds, were a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions beyond the known galaxies, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity. The vastness of space, while beautiful, was also terrifyingly lonely; the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the future of her people, rested heavily on her shoulders as they ventured into the unknown.
