
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a stolen map – a cryptic guide to a rumored lost monastery said to contain ancient wisdom.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her arduous journey, testing her courage and resilience with every sunrise.  Each rickety bridge crossed, each village cautiously entered, brings her closer to the legend – and possibly, to her own demise.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'The Wanderer'. His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a legendary energy source said to power entire galaxies.  Warp jumps through space-time are commonplace, but the perilous encounters with space pirates and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself make every journey a gamble.  He and his crew face down cosmic storms, navigate treacherous asteroid fields, and decipher ancient alien technology, their fate hanging in the balance as they chase the whisper of a galactic legend across the unimaginable expanse of the cosmos.
