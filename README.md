
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the creeping despair of failure.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting kindness from strangers, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faint whisper of a long-lost signal.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying world.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, Eva faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers – gravitational anomalies, rogue space pirates, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar void. Yet, the promise of salvation, however faint, fueled her journey across the uncharted cosmos.
