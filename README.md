
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant city of Prague, bearing a vital message for his lord.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lurked in every shadow of the medieval world. The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting kindness from strangers, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, vital for interstellar travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the tendrils of space-borne anomalies was commonplace, but the true danger came from the unpredictable warp currents, which threatened to tear her ship apart.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies, held a different kind of terror than the medieval forests; a lonely, suffocating vastness that tested even the most seasoned explorer's courage.
