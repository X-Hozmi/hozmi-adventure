
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed several men to fever and exhaustion.  Each sunrise brought the promise of bandit raids or treacherous terrain, yet the lure of Eldoria’s rumored healing waters and untold riches spurred them on.  The creak of leather, the snorts of weary horses, and the constant murmur of whispered prayers formed the soundtrack to their perilous adventure across a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, but the vast expanse of space, peppered with glittering stars and the ever-present threat of pirate factions, held a thrill as potent as any medieval quest.  The success of her mission hinged on her crew's skill, her ship's resilience, and her own courage in the face of the unimaginable.
