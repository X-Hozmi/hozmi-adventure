
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her family's hopes.  Bandit whispers echo in the canyons, and the chill wind bites through her threadbare cloak.  Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, a land said to hold the cure for her ailing brother, is fraught with peril – from the unforgiving terrain to the lurking dangers of both man and beast.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a prayer for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold a rare element vital to faster-than-light travel.  Facing the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Comet and his crew push the boundaries of known space, their courage matched only by the advanced technology that keeps them alive amongst the celestial wonders and terrifying unknowns of the cosmos.
