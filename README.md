
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost secrets of alchemists, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast plummeting to their deaths, and the ever-present gnawing hunger served as a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, fueling her determination to reach her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos Cluster was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of obtaining permits for intergalactic travel.  But the lure of the fabled Nebula of Aethelred, a swirling mass rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was too strong to resist.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but Ryla, fueled by ambition and a thirst for discovery, pressed onward, charting a course through the unmapped expanse of the cosmos.
