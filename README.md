
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor had been brutal; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliff edges, and relentless storms that threatened to swallow them whole. Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to hold unimaginable power, drove him and his small band ever closer to their unknown destination. The whispered promises of wealth and glory, interwoven with the ever-present threat of death, fueled each weary stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had pushed their experimental hyperdrive to its limits, and now, battling cosmic radiation and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, they raced to reach the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The stakes were astronomical, not just the exploration of a new world, but the survival of humanity itself.
