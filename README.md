
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows across the cracked earth.  Her worn map, more faded testament than reliable guide, promised a legendary city beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains – a city said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or the wild beasts that roamed these desolate lands, but the hope of a cure fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula, the swirling colours of cosmic dust painting a vibrant backdrop to the sleek lines of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction generations ago.  The vast distances, the unpredictable space-anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders posed a daunting challenge, but the promise of reuniting a lost people spurred her crew to brave the perilous journey through the inky black between galaxies.
