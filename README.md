
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispers of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in her eyes burns brighter than the midday sun, fueling her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace brings the risk of encountering uncharted gravitational fields or hostile alien life, but the potential rewards—a new home for humanity—make the gamble worthwhile.
