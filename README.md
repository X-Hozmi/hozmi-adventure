
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient power.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Ys, a glimmering promise in the vast, unknown expanse before them, fueled their weary steps.  They were pilgrims on a perilous journey, testing the limits of their endurance and their faith.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy and retrieve a vital energy source crucial to the survival of the Sol Federation.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll Raiders, a notorious spacefaring pirate clan, demanded both skill and courage.   Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap into the unknown depths of the cosmos, but the stakes were cosmically high, forcing Eva and her crew to confront not only physical dangers but also the psychological strain of isolation and the immense scale of the universe itself.
