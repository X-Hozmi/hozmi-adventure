
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of her saddle leather was a testament to the miles already conquered, each sunrise a promise of new challenges.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow her whole, and the constant gnawing hunger was a relentless companion. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of unimaginable riches and exotic spices, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unpredictable landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation through the uncharted cosmic currents was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational forces and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across the immense gulf between star systems.  But the potential reward – the discovery of a new habitable planet, brimming with untold resources and wonders – fueled her crew’s relentless pursuit, a beacon against the terrifying, infinite void.
