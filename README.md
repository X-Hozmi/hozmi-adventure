
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of pack animals and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mimicking the restless anxieties in our hearts. We're bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones – a jewel said to hold unimaginable riches and potent magic. Each sunrise brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the hope of glory and fortune, pushes us onward, our footsteps etching a path into the annals of forgotten history.


Centuries later, the Althea, a starship forged of dreams and polished chrome, cuts a lonely path through the inky void.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond our known galaxy.  We navigate asteroid fields that shimmer like cosmic diamonds, dodge the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and battle the relentless monotony of hyperspace.  The crew, a diverse tapestry of specialists and dreamers, faces the challenges of alien landscapes, dwindling resources, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, united by a shared thirst for discovery and the possibility of finding something truly extraordinary among the stars.
