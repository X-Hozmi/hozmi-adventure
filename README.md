
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling marketplaces and cobbled streets he'd left behind months ago.  His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, a jewel said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a fleeing humanity.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  Each jump through hyperspace brought Elara closer to the unknown, a thrilling yet terrifying prospect.
