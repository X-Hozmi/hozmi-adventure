
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both rider and beast tumbling, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's untold riches and forgotten magic fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new adventure and unforeseen challenges.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, she and her crew faced cosmic radiation, asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize their vessel, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, said to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a thrill unparalleled to any terrestrial adventure, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
