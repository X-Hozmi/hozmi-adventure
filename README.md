
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by tales of the city's miraculous healing waters, pushed him ever closer to his perilous destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her cockpit. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolutionary leap. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the creeping despair of endless space were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like her. The vast unknown held both unimaginable danger and the promise of untold rewards, beckoning her ever deeper into the cosmos.
