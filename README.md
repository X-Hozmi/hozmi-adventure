
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and promise.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to the wind.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, with its whispered tales of untold riches and ancient wisdom, spurred her onward, a beacon against the encroaching darkness.  Every sunrise offered a fresh chance to escape the familiar, to rewrite her destiny on the untamed pathways of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The journey spanned light-years, a perilous voyage through asteroid fields and treacherous wormholes, constantly battling the unpredictable forces of interstellar space.  But the yearning for a new beginning, for a life beyond the dying embers of Earth, fueled her resolve, pushing her and her crew to navigate the vast expanse, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
