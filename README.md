
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track stretching before him, a ribbon of ochre winding through a landscape as unforgiving as the bandits that plagued it. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for peril, but the hope of salvation spurred him on through sun-baked plains and treacherous mountain passes.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, flung across galaxies millennia ago.  Navigation charts were unreliable whispers of a forgotten age, and hyperspace jumps were a gamble against the unforgiving void.  Yet, with every successful jump, each fleeting glimpse of a new, breathtaking planetary system, the allure of discovery fueled her courage against the immense loneliness and potential dangers of interstellar travel.
