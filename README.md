
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for a vital trade agreement across the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or the wrath of unpredictable weather – yet the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, fueled by the promise of returning a hero.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation relied on cryptic star charts and a gut feeling honed by years of interstellar travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional shimmering supernova or the silent grace of a distant planet, instilled both awe and a healthy dose of fear.  The ultimate adventure wasn't just the journey, but the possibility of finding not just a colony, but a whole new world.
