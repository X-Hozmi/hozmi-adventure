
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present possibility of disease.  Yet, with every mile, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, shimmering like a mirage on the edge of our world, spurs us onward.  The tales of its silks, spices, and untold riches fuel our weary legs and steel our resolve against the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The 'Starseeker', a colossal vessel that bends space-time itself, carries me to Xylos, a planet bathed in the emerald glow of a binary sunset.  The journey, though instantaneous thanks to the Alcubierre drive, left me disoriented, a ghost adrift between realities. Now, though, the alien flora bursts with vibrant, impossible colours, while the air hums with the songs of creatures beyond human comprehension.  The risks are different now – the threat of unknown pathogens, hostile indigenous life, or the unpredictable nature of wormholes – but the thrill of discovery, the insatiable human hunger to explore the unknown, remains the same.
