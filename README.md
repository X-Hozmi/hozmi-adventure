
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, guided his destrier across the windswept plains.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Aella, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose spurred them onward, the promise of both spiritual solace and untold riches fueling their arduous trek across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the nebula NGC 7000.  The vibrant colours of the cosmic cloud were a breathtaking backdrop to the hum of the Alcubierre drive, propelling them across interstellar distances at speeds previously unimaginable. Their mission: to locate a habitable planet suitable for colonization amongst a scattered cluster of promising candidates. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the occasional shimmering supernova or mysterious gravitational anomaly, presented a different kind of danger than Reginald’s, but the spirit of adventure – the thirst for the unknown – remained eternally human.
