
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin held little besides a few dried figs and a chipped flint knife, but her heart pulsed with the thrill of the unknown.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of sunlight on her battered sword, fueled her journey to the rumored city of gold, a whispered legend among her people. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the legendary riches and the adventure awaiting her at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, yet the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies, never failed to inspire awe.  Ahead lay the challenges of alien environments, potential first contact, and the constant risk of equipment malfunctions – the price of charting humanity's course among the stars.  But for Eva, the reward far outweighed the peril;  the endless frontier beckoned, promising discoveries beyond imagining.
