
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward through the muddy track.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge: bandits lurking in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with rain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to be hidden in the far-off kingdom of Eldoria, spurred them on.  The clatter of their horses' hooves and the creak of their worn pack animals were a constant rhythm against the backdrop of medieval Europe’s raw, untamed beauty.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues painting the cockpit in ethereal colours.  Their mission: to locate the mythical lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic K'tharr pirates was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the vast unknown, the promise of discovery in galaxies beyond human comprehension.
