
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as his small band of knights crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Salisbury Plain stretching before them.  Their mission: to escort a vital shipment of salt to the besieged castle of Grimshaw, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in legend.  Every creak of their saddles, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, or death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous mission.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation through uncharted star systems, the constant threat of pirate raids, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown alien lifeforms were just some of the obstacles. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the boldest knight's wildest dreams.
