
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map – a guide to the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden somewhere beyond the treacherous Black Mire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of adventure, but also the chilling threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road.  The journey was arduous, testing her spirit and resilience with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet"  Valoria piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and unimaginable distances, held both wonder and peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction were all part of the exhilarating, and terrifying, reality of interstellar travel.  The rewards, however, were the possibility of discovery, and the thrill of charting the unknown.
