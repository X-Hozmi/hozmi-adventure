They were bound for the ancient city of Aethelred, a place whispered about in hushed tones at taverns and campfire gatherings.

Their destination: Proxima Centauri b, an Earth-like planet orbiting the nearest star to our sun. The crew, a diverse band of scientists, explorers, and dreamers, awaited the moment when they would set foot on alien soil, their hearts thrumming with the excitement of pioneers venturing into the unknown.
