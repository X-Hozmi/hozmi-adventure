
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow her whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the allure of the Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices, silks, and untold riches, fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and facing the unpredictable nature of wormholes were all part of a day's work.  But the possibility of discovering a new home, a new beginning for her species, spurred her onwards, a single star in the infinite darkness.
