
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Alexandria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, yet the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', pierced the nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unmapped galaxies and seek out new habitable worlds for humanity's expanding civilization.  Faster-than-light travel had opened the cosmos, but the vastness held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, cosmic storms, and the unknown alien entities lurking in the void.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the universe.
