
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a plea for aid from a besieged town far to the east.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grasses, whispered of potential danger: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering glint in her eyes betrayed the fear, replaced by the steely resolve of a woman on a mission, her journey a tapestry woven with both peril and purpose.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate incursions was a constant battle against the unforgiving vastness of space.  The hum of the hyperdrive engines was a lullaby of adventure, a testament to human ingenuity pushing the boundaries of exploration. Each jump across the cosmos was a leap of faith, a thrilling gamble against the unknown, but for Eva, the chance to discover new worlds far outweighed any risk.
