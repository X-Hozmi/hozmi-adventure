His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to etch his name into legend, spurred him on,  a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.  He carried little, but his hope burned brighter than any torch.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.

The vast distances, the loneliness of space, and the constant threat of system malfunctions were all challenges she accepted with stoic determination.  The fate of thousands rested on her shoulders, a weight that fueled her journey across the cosmic ocean.
