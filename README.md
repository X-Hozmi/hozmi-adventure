The trail, a mere rutted track through the dense Black Forest, offered little comfort against the biting wind and the ever-present threat of brigands.

Captain Eva Rostova, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebula ahead, navigated treacherous asteroid fields and navigated wormholes, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space-time.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced not only the perils of cosmic radiation and malfunctioning equipment, but also the unknown dangers of alien life and uncharted planets, their insatiable curiosity their only compass in this vast, unforgiving expanse.
