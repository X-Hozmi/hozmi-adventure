
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's chainmail as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating confusing crossroads, bartering for meager sustenance in impoverished villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger, both human and natural.  Yet, the allure of the sacred shrine and the thrill of the unknown fueled their relentless march.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her gaze fixed on the navigation console.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had already spanned generations, the ship a self-sustaining ark carrying humanity's hopes for a new beginning.  While the dangers were different – cosmic storms, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien civilizations – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vastness of space, however, dwarfed even the largest medieval kingdom, making the quest for a new home both breathtaking and terrifyingly immense.
