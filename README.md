
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun a merciless eye in the vast, empty sky.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promised a fabled city of gold beyond the whispering mountains, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching desert.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, sharpened her senses, reminding her of the constant gamble of life on the medieval road.  The thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of forgotten empires, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours painting the viewport.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey, a months-long odyssey across the star-strewn void, was punctuated by asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on unsuspecting travelers. Yet, the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting unknown galaxies, made the risks worthwhile.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held a different kind of adventure than any medieval traveler could ever have imagined.
