Ahead lay the rumored sanctuary of Saint Gildas, a pilgrimage fraught with peril – bandits roamed the shadowed forests, and the whispers of a vengeful baron haunted the windswept moors.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of this medieval journey.

Now, charting a course through the swirling nebula toward the rumored Xylos diamond mines, Rexx felt the familiar thrill of galactic exploration battling the gnawing anxiety of the unknown.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of breathtaking beauty and terrifying danger, promised riches beyond measure – but only for the bold enough to navigate its treacherous expanse.
