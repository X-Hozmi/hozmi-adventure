
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to him.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the treacherous Baron de Malvoisin, rumored to have fortified himself in a hidden mountain fortress.  Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous passes, and the constant gnawing fear of betrayal.  His loyal companions, a grizzled veteran and a cunning rogue, were his only solace in this perilous journey across a land steeped in both beauty and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted planet Kepler-186f. The journey was measured not in days, but in weeks of warp travel, a constant hum of the engines her only companion amidst the silent immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, a faint signal their only clue in the vast expanse of the galaxy.  The risks were different now – alien predators, malfunctioning systems, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies, yet the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned just as brightly as it had for Sir Kaelan centuries ago.
