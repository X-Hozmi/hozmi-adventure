
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, felt less holy and more a brutal test of endurance.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of disease and starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred him on, the promise of the distant cathedral a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.  He travelled through bustling market towns and isolated villages, each encounter a story in itself, etching itself into the tapestry of his adventure.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational currents was commonplace; encountering unknown alien life forms, less so.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse.  While lacking the immediate physical hardship of Thomas's medieval trek, Eva faced a different kind of peril, the cold, calculating risk of the cosmos, a vast and indifferent canvas upon which her courage and skill painted their story.
