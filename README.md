
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to the air.  Her journey to the Holy City was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every step. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, fueled by whispered tales of faraway lands and the unwavering hope of finding her missing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' pierced the nebula's swirling colours, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a billion shimmering suns. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien lifeforms.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of new worlds teeming with life (or the thrill of discovering something utterly unknown), outweighed the risks, making the seemingly endless voyage a thrilling odyssey through the cosmos.
