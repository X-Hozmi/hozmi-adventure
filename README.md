
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his armor rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches, kept him pushing forward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and the Middle East.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset a testament to the perilous beauty of his journey.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden, catastrophic solar flare decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory warships of the Kryll Hegemony, Elara and her crew relied on cutting-edge technology and unwavering courage. The vastness of space held both breathtaking wonder and terrifying unknowns; a journey far removed from the medieval knight’s struggle, yet equally filled with the intoxicating blend of peril and potential that defines true adventure.
