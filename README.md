
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the unwavering hope for her brother's recovery fueled her journey, making every hardship a stepping stone on her epic, land-bound pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous journey between galaxies.  Their sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across light-years, defying the vast distances of space.  The mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a dying Earth.  Jax faced dangers far removed from medieval perils— rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failures. Yet, the weight of humanity's future rested on his shoulders, driving him forward through the infinite expanse.
