
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst her people, promising riches and a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, reminding her of the dangers lurking in the vast, untamed wilderness – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Her journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of Eldoria fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void, its hyperdrive spitting her towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  The mission: to locate a lost colony, whispered to have mastered a technology capable of sustaining life across the vast emptiness of space. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling the ever-present threat of solar flares, Ryla and her crew faced a challenge far beyond the medieval adventurer's, but the lure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, held the same intoxicating power.  The unknown beckoned, a vast and awe-inspiring ocean of stars.
