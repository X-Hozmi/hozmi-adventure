
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on his back as he navigated the treacherous, overgrown path through the Black Forest.  Rumours of a mythical city, lost for centuries, fuelled his quest, whispering promises of untold riches and arcane knowledge. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, kept him pressing ever forward towards the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expansion.  The journey was fraught with peril; navigating asteroid fields, encountering bizarre alien lifeforms, and facing the constant threat of system malfunctions pushed her and her crew to the limits of their endurance. Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, the wonder of discovering new worlds, and the hope of securing a future for humanity far outweighed the risks, driving them relentlessly towards their distant destination.
