
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping at my cloak as I urged my weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be home to more than just wolves and bandits.  My quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Bavaria, a journey fraught with peril, but one I embraced with a thrill that outweighed the fear.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential encounter, a testament to the unpredictable and exhilarating nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Unlike the medieval treks of my ancestors, this journey was measured in light years and parsecs, not days and weeks.  Yet, the thrill remained the same – the unknown, the vastness of space, the potential for discovery and danger lurking around every nebula and asteroid field.  The adventure, though different in scale, held the same intoxicating power.
