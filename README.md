
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her trusty steed, Comet, picks its way through the rocky foothills.  Ahead lies the treacherous Whisperwind Pass, legendary for its bandit hordes and unpredictable weather.  Elara, a cartographer seeking the lost city of Zerzura, carries with her only a worn map, a compass that spins wildly at times, and an unwavering determination to uncover the secrets hidden within the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, holds the promise of both peril and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of black holes, Eva's journey is a constant battle against the unforgiving elements of space.  The thrill of exploration, however, fuels her every decision, for within each unexplored nebula, each newly discovered system, lies the hope of a new beginning – a new home for humanity.
