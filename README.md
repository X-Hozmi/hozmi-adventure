
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guided her across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and untold riches, fueling her relentless journey through uncharted lands, shadowed by bandits and haunted by legends.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, his ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve the lost artifact of Aethelred from the unmapped planet of Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to intergalactic travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of Xylos pirates, Rexx pushed his ship and crew to their limits, driven by the promise of glory and the tantalizing allure of the unknown.
