
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust that swirled around them like phantom spirits.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the vast, unforgiving desert threatened to swallow them whole. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the constant threat of starvation.  But the allure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the distance, spurred them on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been harrowing, pushing their experimental warp drive to its limits.  Now, navigating the treacherous asteroid fields surrounding the unexplored planet Kepler-186f was a delicate dance between survival and discovery.  The potential rewards – a new source of energy, a lost civilization – were immeasurable, but so were the risks.  A single miscalculation could mean the end of their mission, and perhaps, their lives.
