
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes against bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager rations in dusty villages.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the unwavering hope of Eldoria's healing power spurred them across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across light years of unexplored space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and enduring the relentless hum of the warp drive were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space dwarfed their tiny vessel, yet the unwavering hope of finding the colonists fueled their tireless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
