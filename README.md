
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her trusty mare across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, holds the potential for adventure – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, a chance encounter with wandering monks bearing news of distant lands, or perhaps the discovery of a forgotten ruin whispering tales of forgotten magic. The journey itself is a gamble, a dance with the unknown, but the promise of riches and glory in the distant city of Constantinople fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast distances separate her from her homeworld, and each jump through hyperspace carries the thrill of unpredictable encounters – alien leviathans guarding unexplored systems, derelict space stations concealing forgotten technologies, or perhaps even a glimpse of the mythical, energy-rich Xylos core.  The perilous journey demands precision and courage, but the allure of discovering new life and unlocking the galaxy's secrets compels her to press on, a lone explorer charting the uncharted cosmos.
