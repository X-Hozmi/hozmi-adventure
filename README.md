
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of her resolve. Yet, with every aching muscle and each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, a potent elixir stronger than fear. This was a journey not just of miles, but of self-discovery, etched onto the landscape of her soul.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The hyperspace jump had been treacherous, a near-miss with a rogue asteroid field leaving her crew shaken but unharmed.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  The vast emptiness of space, the stunning beauty of nebulae and distant planets, and the constant threat of unknown dangers were all part of the intoxicating allure of galactic exploration.  The universe was their oyster, and Ryla, with her seasoned crew, were ready to shuck it open.
