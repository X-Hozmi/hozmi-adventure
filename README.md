Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from York to Constantinople.  His meager supplies dwindling, and bandits a constant threat, Thomas’s journey was a test of endurance and courage, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden perils.  He rode, spurred by hope and a thirst for the unknown, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent tapestry of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, flinging her tiny vessel across the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  With a galaxy of unknowns before her—dangerous nebulae, rogue planets, and potentially hostile alien civilizations—Eva's voyage was a relentless push against the boundaries of human exploration, a testament to both daring and the boundless curiosity of humankind.
