
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and the weight of her secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at both danger and discovery.  Bandit raids were commonplace, and the whispers of a mythical city hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains fueled her relentless journey, a perilous quest for a cure to her ailing brother.  The vastness of the unknown spurred her onward, a tapestry woven with the thrill of survival and the hope of a miracle.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of his navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world said to hold both untold riches and lethal dangers.  Warp jumps sent shivers down his spine, the sheer scale of the cosmos a constant reminder of his insignificance yet also of the limitless possibilities that lay scattered amongst the stars.  The galaxy was his playground, a vast expanse of adventure and peril awaiting his daring exploration.
