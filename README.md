
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he and his small company crest a windswept hill, the distant spires of Camelot a mere shimmer on the horizon.  Their journey to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude has been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of urgency, each sunset a gnawing fear of the unknown landscapes that still lie ahead.  The weight of their mission, and the unforgiving terrain, tests their loyalty and courage at every turn.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, but the journey is far from simple.  Warp jumps are unpredictable, fraught with the possibility of encountering hostile space pirates or stumbling into uncharted gravitational anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space is punctuated by the ever-present hum of the ship's engines and the quiet hum of her crew's anxieties; the potential rewards of discovery are weighed against the constant risk of catastrophic failure in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
