
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, guides his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to break his resolve. Yet, the whispers of Ys, of healing and salvation, fuel his journey, pushing him ever closer to his unknown destiny across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and flickering across the void.  Each jump through hyperspace brings the risk of encountering hostile space pirates or unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the weight of her crew's lives resting on her shoulders.  But the hope of finding the missing colonists, the promise of rediscovering a lost human civilization, drives her across the unimaginable distances between the stars.
