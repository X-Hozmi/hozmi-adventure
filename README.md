
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  They navigated treacherous mountain passes, evaded bandit ambushes hidden in shadowed forests, and forded raging rivers swollen by spring melt. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of unseen dangers lurking in the wilderness. Their only solace lay in their shared purpose and the unwavering hope of reaching Eldoria.

Centuries later, Captain Elara's starship, *Stardust*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hyperspace jump was jarring, a violent shift from the familiar cold of space to the swirling kaleidoscope of impossible colours within the warp. Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace decades ago. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets were child's play compared to the unnerving silence between stars and the constant, low hum of the ship's engines – a relentless reminder of the immense distances and the unknown dangers that lay ahead.
