
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, speaks of the unknown that lies ahead – bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Her journey, to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, is fraught with peril, but the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels her onward, a lone figure silhouetted against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the dangers are no less real.  Pirate fleets lurk in the shadows between galaxies, and unknown celestial phenomena threaten to obliterate even the most advanced vessels.  Rexx's mission: to deliver a vital payload across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unimaginable risks, but potentially offering rewards beyond his wildest dreams.
