
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each day brought fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the distant spice markets of Constantinople spurred us onward, fueled by tales of unimaginable wealth and exotic wonders. The journey tested our resilience, our camaraderie, and our faith, forging bonds stronger than any forged steel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  The alien landscapes I explore—from the iridescent gas giants of Xylos to the crystalline cities of the Kryll—are breathtaking and terrifying in equal measure.  The solitude is profound, but the discoveries, the knowledge gleaned from exploring the cosmos, are a reward beyond any earthly treasure.
