
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the ridge, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  Her journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless – weeks spent traversing muddy tracks, dodging bandits in shadowed forests, and bartering for meager sustenance in ramshackle villages.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: fording raging rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the whispered legends of Jerusalem, the promise of salvation, fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking, terrifying landscape.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  Though technology offered a degree of safety her medieval counterparts could only dream of, the vastness of space held its own brand of terrifying uncertainty.  The loneliness of deep space, the weight of responsibility for her crew, was a burden as heavy as any medieval packhorse.
