
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King, a perilous journey undertaken alone through bandit-ridden forests and treacherous mountain passes. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of apprehension down her spine, yet the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a true medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Corvus piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms was all in a day's work for Comet, a seasoned spacefarer chasing the ultimate frontier.  The vastness of space held both immense danger and unimaginable wonder, a siren's call to the intrepid explorer of the future.
