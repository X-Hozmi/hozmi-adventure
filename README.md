
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest – to find the lost monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the key to a potent healing balm – had led her through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in the woods, the gnawing threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of the plague that ravaged the land.  But the lure of the monastery, and the hope it held, kept her pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Nova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, said to possess a rare element capable of powering faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was treacherous, the nebula's unpredictable currents a constant threat to the ship's delicate systems.  Lyra faced not only the hazards of space, but also the political intrigues of the Galactic Federation, and the shadowy forces who sought to control Aethel's power for their own nefarious purposes. The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness than the medieval wilds – a vast, echoing solitude punctuated only by the hum of the ship’s engines.
