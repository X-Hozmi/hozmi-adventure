
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth thick in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with winter's lingering ice, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, with every creak of my saddle and clang of my sword against its scabbard, the thrill of the unknown spurred me onward. I journeyed not for gold, but for the whispered tales of a lost city, shrouded in legend and said to hold the secrets of a forgotten magic.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Stars blurred into streaks of incandescent light as we leaped across the vast gulf between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel itself.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, solar flares that could cripple our ship, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  But the same intrepid spirit that drove medieval travelers burned within me; the lure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of the known, was as potent as ever.
