
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The map, brittle with age, promised riches and glory in the far-off city of Samarkand, but the reality was blistered feet, dwindling rations, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, reminding her that survival, not riches, was the true adventure.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking vistas, a relentless test of her spirit and resilience against the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across galaxies was less about physical hardship and more a test of nerves, navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and the ever-present threat of unknown space anomalies.  The vastness of the cosmos was both terrifying and exhilarating, a humbling experience that dwarfed even the greatest medieval explorations.
