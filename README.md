
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and unforgiving deserts stretching endlessly under the relentless sun.  His loyal squire, Thomas, rode steadfastly beside him, their shared hope fueling their weary bodies against the odds.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory Zydonian cruisers, she relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's advanced technology.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by breathtaking cosmic wonders, both terrified and exhilarated her as she pursued the unknown, risking everything for the chance to rewrite galactic history.
