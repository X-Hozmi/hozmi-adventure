
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin stiff with dust and sweat, spurred his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire as he and his small band pressed towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril: bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where icy winds threatened to sweep them into oblivion, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to their resilience.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life.  Navigating hyperspace was a constant dance between precision and luck, a gamble against the odds, fuelled by the unwavering hope of finding those lost among the stars.
