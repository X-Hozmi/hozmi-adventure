
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, inches across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in my own heart.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the sparse brush, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the plague.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, the promise of exotic spices and untold riches in the distant East, drives us onward, fueled by hope and a stubborn refusal to surrender to the harsh realities of the medieval world.  Every sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape, a new potential for adventure and peril.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are the highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a shimmering path through the nebula of the Andromeda galaxy.  We’re charting unknown sectors, seeking out habitable planets and the whispers of ancient civilizations.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the silent hum of the Alcubierre drive a constant reminder of the fragile bubble of safety surrounding us.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Will we discover paradise or annihilation?  Only the cosmos holds the answer, and the thrill of uncovering its secrets is a potent allure that fuels our endless journey.
