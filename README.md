
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them forward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the relentless pursuit of a whispered legend.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Warp jumps across galaxies were perilous, each one a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.  Facing cosmic storms, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure, Elara and her crew relied on their skills, their courage, and the unwavering belief in the possibility of finding life, even across the vast gulf of interstellar space.
