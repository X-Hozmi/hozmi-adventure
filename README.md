
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of York, a pack horse laden with meager supplies our only companion.  Ahead lies the treacherous expanse of the Sherwood Forest, rumored to be haunted by outlaws and riddled with hidden pathways.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge; navigating bogland, bartering for food in sparsely populated villages, and always, the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  The lure of the distant Mediterranean, with its promise of spice markets and untold riches, fuels our weary steps.  This is not a journey for the faint of heart; it's a test of endurance, wit, and sheer will.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship powered by a captured singularity, cuts a shimmering path through the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  We brave nebulae choked with radiation, navigate treacherous asteroid fields, and evade the watchful eyes of the Kryll, a sentient species that guards its territory fiercely. Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown,  yet the potential rewards—a future unbound by the constraints of distance—make the risk worthwhile.
