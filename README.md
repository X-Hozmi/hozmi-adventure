
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the ever-present threat of war loomed large. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in hostile villages, and relying on the kindness of strangers. Yet, the lure of the exotic East, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and ancient wonders, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the K'tharr Hegemony's territory.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold beauty of distant suns and the ever-present hum of the ship's engines, was a stark contrast to the close confines of the crew quarters, where interpersonal tensions simmered alongside the bubbling nutrient paste.  The quest for new worlds demanded bravery, resilience, and an unwavering spirit of exploration.
