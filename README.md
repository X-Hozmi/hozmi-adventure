
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but scrolls detailing ancient prophecies, her only guide on a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery hidden deep within the Black Forest.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation test her resolve, but the whispers of forgotten magic fuel her onward, promising a destiny intertwined with the forest's secrets. Each sunrise reveals a new challenge, a new opportunity for adventure and discovery in this harsh, breathtaking world.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble speck against the cosmic canvas.  The mission: to locate a legendary lost colony scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Wormholes and asteroid fields present perilous obstacles, and the ever-present threat of space pirates adds another layer of danger.  But the allure of discovering a new civilization, a new culture, a new hope for humanity, propels her through the vast, inky blackness.  The universe unfolds before them, a testament to the boundless possibilities of interstellar exploration.
