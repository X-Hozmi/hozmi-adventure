
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold secrets of unimaginable power, hidden deep within the unforgiving Sahara.  Bandits, scorching sun, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the whisper of legend – of lost knowledge and untold riches – spurred him on, each sunrise a fresh challenge in his perilous journey across the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the emerald planet of Aethel.  The jump to hyperspace had been jarring, the rhythmic hum of the Alcubierre drive a constant reminder of the vast distances separating civilizations in this sprawling galaxy.  Ahead lay the potential for first contact, the discovery of new species, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile forces lurking in the uncharted sectors.  Each jump was a gamble, each star a beacon in the limitless darkness.
