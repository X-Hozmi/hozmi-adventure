
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Zaragoza, rumored to hold the lost manuscripts of a forgotten sorcerer.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the whisper of magic and the promise of untold knowledge fueled her onward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way. Her crew, a motley band of explorers from a dozen different planets, hunted the mythical Xylos nebula, a region whispered to contain the genesis of all life.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the grasp of space pirates, Ryla's journey demanded not only courage, but a deep understanding of cosmic currents and the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel.  The reward, however, promised to rewrite the very history of the universe.
