
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely more than a goat trail, snaked across the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure and peril.  Bandits were a constant threat, the terrain treacherous, and the whispered tales of mythical beasts lurking in the shadowed valleys fueled his every stride towards the fabled city of Zamora, a journey steeped in both excitement and palpable fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of celestial wonders unfolding outside her viewport.  Each jump through hyperspace held the thrill of discovery, but also the risk of encountering unpredictable gravitational fields or, worse, hostile alien civilizations. The vast emptiness of space presented a different kind of peril, a lonely vastness that tested the courage and resolve of even the most seasoned spacefarer.
