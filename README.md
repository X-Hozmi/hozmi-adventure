
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Carpathian Mountains.  My quest? To reach the legendary city of K’tharr, whispered to hold the secret to a cure for the Black Death ravaging Europe.  Each day brought new peril: treacherous passes, ravenous wolves, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  But the lure of K’tharr, and the hope it offered, spurred me onward,  a single figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to possess the elusive element Xylium, crucial to the survival of my people.  Unlike the medieval journeys of my ancestors, this voyage was swift, but no less fraught with danger.  Asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded constant vigilance from our crew.  Yet, the vast, glittering panorama of the cosmos, the breathtaking sight of nebulae swirling light-years away, filled me with a sense of awe that mirrored – and perhaps surpassed – the wonder experienced by those who dared to venture across the medieval world.
