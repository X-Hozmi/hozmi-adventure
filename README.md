
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them further across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that had vanished near the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, stars blazed past like fleeting embers, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on them.  While lacking the immediate dangers of brigands and blizzards, the journey presented its own terrifying possibilities – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the chilling unknown of interstellar space itself.  The vastness of the cosmos, however, fueled her determination as much as it instilled a healthy dose of fear.
