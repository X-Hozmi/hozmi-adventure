
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as he guides his weary steed across the sun-baked plains of France.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's healing power fuel his onward journey, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost somewhere in the Andromeda Galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines of time and distance, but the vastness of space presents its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  The weight of her crew's lives rests on her shoulders as she navigates this interstellar ocean, driven by hope and the unwavering commitment to find her lost compatriots.
