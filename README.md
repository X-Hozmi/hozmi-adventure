
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, swallowed the horse's hooves as they journeyed across the windswept moors of northern England.  Each dawn brought the chilling promise of bandit encounters or the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, yet the lure of the fabled lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, drove him relentlessly forward.  He carried with him only his sword, a meager pouch of coins, and an unwavering determination to unravel the mysteries that lay hidden beyond the next horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, far from the primitive trails of Reginald's era, spanned lightyears, each jump a calculated risk across treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted space.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond the known galaxies.  With a crew of hardened explorers and the vast expanse of the cosmos stretching before her, Elara faced dangers far more profound than bandits and hunger, but her spirit, like Reginald's, burned with an insatiable thirst for discovery.
