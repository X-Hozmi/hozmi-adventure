
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dust-choked serpent winding through the unforgiving Provençal countryside, creaks onward.  Each sunrise brings the promise of bandits, the threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of the Black Death. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, whispering tales of unimaginable riches and exotic spices in the distant East, outweighs the peril.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every hushed prayer to a fickle God, is a step closer to a destiny unknown, a tapestry woven with threads of courage and desperation.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek obsidian hull of the 'Starseeker' cuts through the inky blackness, a tiny spark against the immensity of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our mission: to chart a course through unmapped nebulae, searching for habitable planets beyond the reach of human civilization. The thrill of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, outweighs the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel and the constant threat of unforeseen cosmic phenomena. Every jump through hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble with fate itself, promising untold rewards for those brave enough to reach for the stars.
