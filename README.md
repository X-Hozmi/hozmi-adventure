
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Kaelan's boots as he guides his weary steed across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of healing his plague-stricken kingdom.  Each sunrise brings fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of Ys, and the desperate hope for his people, spurs him onward, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the Kepler-186f system.  The mission: to establish a colony on a potentially habitable planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers in derelict warships, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the perilous journey.  The vast expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, but the promise of a new beginning for humanity fueled Eva's unwavering determination.
