
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile seed – a rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought the potential for banditry or worse. Yet, the whispered promise of salvation spurred her onward, through echoing forests and across windswept plains, a lone adventurer against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming spores to a newly discovered planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and cosmic wonders, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, but the hope of fostering life on a barren world fueled her courage, propelling her ship across the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
