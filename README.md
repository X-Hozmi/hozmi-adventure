
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a map stained with rain, and the hope of finding her brother, lost in the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Each day was a battle against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of her journey, yet the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of legendary cities and hidden monasteries, kept her pushing onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of his navigation.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light years, a voyage fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies. But the lure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, and the chance to carve his name into the annals of interstellar exploration, fueled his relentless drive across the cosmic expanse.
