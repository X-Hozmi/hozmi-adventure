
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged along the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on her and her mule.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Mountains, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  This journey to the distant city of Porthaven, to deliver a vital message for her ailing lord, was fraught with peril.  Each creak of the mule's harness, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of fear through her, yet the urgency of her mission spurred her onward.  The fate of her lord, and perhaps her own, hung in the balance.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy bursts from collapsing stars, was a routine, yet exhilarating, challenge.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both immense wonder and deadly threat.   The weight of her mission – to establish a new colony – rested heavily on her shoulders, but the thrill of exploration fueled her every action.
