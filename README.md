
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, a legendary barrier separating his homeland from the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumours of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets fueled his journey, a dangerous gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable fury of nature. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through a nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous mission. Their destination: Kepler-186f, an exoplanet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on their technology and their courage, a true adventure among the stars.
