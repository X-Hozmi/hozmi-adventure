
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a scrabbling tapestry of horses, mules, and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing fear of bandit raids, and each sunset the agonizing slowness of our progress.  The whispered tales of Constantinople, a city of glittering spires and unimaginable wealth, fuel our aching muscles, pushing us onward despite the ever-present threat of starvation, disease, and the brutal indifference of the landscape. The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, turning them into fantastical beasts guarding the secrets held within their peaks.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* leaps across the void, a fragile ark in the inky blackness between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faint whisper of quasars, her crew a motley collection of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and hardened spacers.  The thrill of discovery outweighs the ever-present danger of encountering uncharted nebulae, rogue asteroids, or worse – hostile alien civilizations.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a thrilling plunge into the unknown where the greatest adventure isn't just finding new worlds, but surviving to tell the tale.
