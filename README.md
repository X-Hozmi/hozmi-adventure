
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the relentless sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone hidden deep within the Dragon's Tooth mountains, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel – a constant dance with survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' across the yawning gulf of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate incursions from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were commonplace. Unlike Gareth's earthy struggles, Eva faced the silent, infinite terror of the cosmos, where the smallest malfunction could mean oblivion, a stark reminder that even in the future, adventure remained a perilous gamble.
