
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary in the far-off lands beyond the Black Forest.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse. Yet, the burning sun on her face and the vast, unknown horizon fueled her onward.  This journey, perilous though it was, held the promise of a better life, a future etched in the starless night above.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy. Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily affair, a constant gamble against the unforgiving vastness of space.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic entities fueled her journey.  The future of interstellar travel rested on the shoulders of this lone captain, bravely charting a course through the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
