
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous plains of Aquilonia had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother, spurred her onward, each sunrise renewing her desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the chaotic birth of a new star system.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the relentless gravitational pull of black holes was a daily challenge, but the potential discovery of a new, habitable world – and the promise of untold scientific breakthroughs – fueled her unwavering determination. The vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos held both terrifying and breathtaking wonders, a constant reminder of the risks and rewards of interstellar travel.
