
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step of her horse was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The scent of pine and damp earth fought with the stench of fear, a constant companion on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a gravitational anomaly decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous warp lanes was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the K'tharr Hegemony's territory.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of peril—the suffocating loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present possibility of encountering something...unexpected.
