
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of peril – bandits, wild beasts, or the very elements themselves.  His meager supplies, the worn map clutched in his hand, and the unwavering fire in his heart were all that stood between him and failure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light-years to the Kepler-186f system.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of cosmic wonders unfolding outside her viewport.  Her mission: a first contact attempt with a potentially sentient civilization.  The risks were immense – unknown alien life, equipment malfunctions in the unforgiving vacuum of space – but the potential reward, the advancement of humankind, fueled her every action.
