
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, a city of gold and untold riches.  Every creak of my pack, every rustle in the snow, fueled a growing sense of unease, yet the lure of adventure, of facing the unknown, propelled me forward.  Bandits, blizzards, and starvation were all potential foes, but the promise of Eldoria overshadowed every fear.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, not the howl of the wind.  Stars streaked past the viewport, a dizzying kaleidoscope of colours as we jumped between galaxies. My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace centuries ago.  The vast emptiness of space, the potential for malfunction, and the very real threat of unknown alien lifeforms were hazards far different than any mountain pass, but the thrill of exploration, of uncovering the fate of a lost civilization, spurred me onward.
