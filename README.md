
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her quest – to find the lost monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold ancient secrets – had led her through treacherous mountain passes, across swollen rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the whispering woods.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in the shadows, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the chilling uncertainty of the unknown.  Yet, the thrill of the journey, the promise of discovery, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the navigation console, the jarring sound barely audible above the hum of the Althea's warp drive.  Their journey to Xylos, a planet shrouded in myth at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy, had already tested their ship and crew to their limits.  Nebula storms had threatened to tear them apart, and rogue asteroids had danced dangerously close.  But the allure of Xylos – a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap – was a siren's call, impossible to resist. The vast, unknowable expanse of space was a terrifying, thrilling challenge, and Rexx wouldn't have it any other way.
