
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, stained with rain and sweat, offered little comfort against the looming peaks.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, reminding her of the constant danger that defined this medieval odyssey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new colony for humanity, a jewel of a planet promising lush landscapes and untold resources. But the journey across the galaxy was far from simple.  Warp-core fluctuations threatened to tear her ship apart,  and pirate broadcasts crackled over the comms, a constant reminder of the lawless expanse between worlds.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with starlight and danger, presented a challenge as daunting as any medieval mountain pass.
