
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mare onward.  The sun beat down on the parched landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of disease hung like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the unwavering faith in her heart, and the whispered stories of miraculous cures at the shrine, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-abandoned research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world veiled in mystery.  The jump to hyperspace was a violent shudder, the stars streaking past like celestial fireflies.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of alien lifeforms all formed part of the routine.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, ignited a fierce spark within Eva – a yearning for exploration that mirrored Elara's centuries-old pilgrimage.
