
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Her worn map, a testament to countless ripped edges and hastily drawn additions, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold an ancient relic.  The journey was fraught with peril, a constant battle against the elements and the unknown, yet the thrill of discovery spurred her onward, a beacon against the gnawing fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starfall" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was child's play compared to the political minefield of interplanetary relations.  The vastness of space, however, held its own kind of danger—the loneliness of infinite distances, the constant threat of unforeseen cosmic events, and the ever-present pressure of charting a path for a desperate species clinging to survival.
