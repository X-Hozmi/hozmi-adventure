
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder.  They'd dodged bandits in the Black Forest, shared meager meals with weary pilgrims, and marveled at the towering Alps, their snow-capped peaks piercing the bruised autumn sky. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from fording raging rivers to navigating treacherous mountain passes, all for the sake of fulfilling a sacred vow and seeking redemption.  The road itself, a living entity of dust and grit, was their constant companion, a testament to the unwavering human spirit that sought adventure, even in the face of daunting odds.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the road.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – navigating asteroid fields, evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar space. But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of discovering new worlds and civilizations, propelled her forward, a modern-day adventurer forging a path through the cosmos just as her medieval ancestors had once trod the earth.
