
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unfamiliar landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a map barely legible with age, a few dried fruits, and a chipped flintlock pistol – meager supplies for a journey across the treacherous Black Forest, a pilgrimage to find her estranged brother, rumored to have joined a mercenary company.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised danger, but the glint of adventure burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored paradise planet light years from her home.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields, dodging rogue plasma bursts, and battling the occasional space pirate were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer.  The vast expanse of space held a different kind of danger – the loneliness of infinity – but the thrill of discovery, the promise of new worlds and alien civilizations, far outweighed the risk.
