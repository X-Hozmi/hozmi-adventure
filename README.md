
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his determination, each sunrise promising a step closer to his elusive goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling life support were all in a day's work.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien worlds, and the potential for discovery kept her heart pounding with the same adventurous spirit that drove Thomas centuries before.
