
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred him and his small band of companions across the unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her vessel.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and hostile alien territories.  Unlike Reginald's earthly struggles, Elara's challenges were technological – faulty warp drives, dwindling fuel reserves, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks. But the promise of discovering a new civilisation fueled her determination to complete her perilous galactic voyage.
