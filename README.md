
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the unpredictable weather could bring a swift and merciless end to any journey. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, the tantalizing hope of reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a constant battle against the unforgiving expanse of space. The solitude was immense, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling of subspace comms. Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential of finding life beyond Earth, fueled her determination to push ever onward, a lone explorer charting a course into the cosmic unknown.
