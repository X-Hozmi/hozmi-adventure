
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the mud, the chill wind whipping at their cloaks. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, spurs them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with danger, hardship, and the unwavering bond of comradeship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling of billions of suns, holds both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Hyper-jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make each leg of her journey a gamble, but the lifeblood she carries, and the promise of discovery, fuel her relentless pursuit across the galaxy.
