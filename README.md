
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, spurred his mount onward.  The wind whipped across the bleak, rolling hills of northern England, carrying the scent of rain and woodsmoke.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his weary bones, driving him ever closer to his uncertain destination.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace.  The vastness of the cosmos held a terrifying beauty, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against malfunctioning engines or unforeseen celestial events.  But the call of the unknown, the chance to rescue lost souls, and the lure of undiscovered planets propelled her onwards, a lone voyager braving the infinite expanse of the galaxy.
