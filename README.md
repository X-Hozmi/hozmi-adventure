
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Thomas's saddlebags as his weary horse plodded through the sun-baked fields of France.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees, said to hold the key to curing his sister's illness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in the face of his unwavering devotion. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each sunset a reminder of the vast distance yet to cover.  He carried not only supplies, but the weight of his family's hope.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the vast emptiness between stars instilled a different kind of loneliness than Thomas had known.  Instead of bandits, she faced the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the constant threat of rogue asteroids.  The weight of billions rested on her shoulders, not just the hope of a family, but the fate of an entire species.
