
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, felt increasingly desperate.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger in his belly.  He clung to the tattered map, its cryptic symbols his only guide, spurred on by a mixture of hope and sheer stubborn will to survive this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the distant K'tharr homeworld, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of space pirates, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted sectors.  The hum of the hyperdrive and the vast expanse of space offered a stark contrast to Thomas’s medieval struggles, but the thrill of exploration, the unwavering determination to reach her destination, echoed across the ages.
