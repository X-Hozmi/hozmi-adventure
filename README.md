
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map promising riches in the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Eldoria's wonders, spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a pulse of the adventure that throbbed in her veins.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast tapestry of the cosmos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and battling the suffocating loneliness of interstellar space were all part of the journey.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to rewrite the history of galactic exploration, fueled his unwavering resolve.
