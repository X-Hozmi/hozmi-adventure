
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promised both peril and the rumored hidden city of Eldoria, a legendary haven said to hold ancient magic.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the whispers of the land itself spoke of things best left undisturbed.  Her quest was perilous, but the promise of Eldoria, and the treasures it held, fuelled her onward.

Centuries hence, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll raiders, Rexx relied on his trusty co-pilot, Zyl, and the ship's aging hyperdrive.  The cosmos held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that threatened to consume the *Stardust Drifter* and its crew before they could reach their goal.
