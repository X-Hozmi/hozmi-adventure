
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy lanes of London, a cart groaning under the weight of salted meats and meager supplies.  Ahead lay the vast, unpredictable expanse of Europe, a tapestry woven with treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests teeming with bandits, and unpredictable rivers swollen with spring rains. Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown – a chance encounter with a wandering minstrel, the chilling sight of a ruined castle silhouetted against a stormy sky, the comforting warmth of a crackling fire in a humble village inn. The goal: Constantinople, a legendary city shimmering on the horizon of our dreams.


Millennia later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Starseeker* hummed beneath me as we jumped across the void, leaving the familiar spiral of the Milky Way behind.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years away.  The journey was punctuated not by the creaks of a wagon wheel but by the hum of the Alcubierre drive, the breathtaking panorama of nebulae, and the quiet camaraderie of our diverse crew.  Each hyperspace jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos, but the promise of discovery spurred us onwards.
