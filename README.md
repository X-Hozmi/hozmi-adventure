
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered legends, guided her toward the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise – or the threat – of adventure.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant dangers, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Zerzura's untold riches and powerful magic, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and silent voids, was both exhilarating and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields, skirmishes with space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were the daily realities of her journey.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting worlds once separated by light-years, fuelled her courage and made the risks worthwhile.
