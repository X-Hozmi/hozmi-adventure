
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing the perilous route to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his strength and resilience, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another league conquered on his arduous pilgrimage.  He dreamt not of riches, but of the ancient wisdom whispered to reside within Eldoria's walls.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of star jumps and warp drives, punctuated by the crackle of the comm system and the hum of the Alcubierre drive.  Asteroid fields posed a constant threat, requiring deft maneuvering and quick reflexes.  The loneliness of deep space pressed upon the crew, a constant companion to the awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos.  Their mission was not of conquest, but of discovery – to seek out new life and new civilizations in the vast, uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
