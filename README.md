His quest: to reach the fabled city of Serinor, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Elara, alongside her diverse crew, pressed on, driven by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of the disappearing colony.
