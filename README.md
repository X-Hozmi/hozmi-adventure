
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, the landscape shifting from verdant valleys to harsh, unforgiving deserts.  He faced bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, pushed him relentlessly towards his goal.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates, she relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's cutting-edge technology.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held endless possibilities, but also untold dangers.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.
