
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess,  trudged through the mud, the chilling November wind biting at their faces.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the King's ailing son.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and grappling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vast, awe-inspiring expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of the courage and ingenuity required to traverse the infinite distances between worlds.
