
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the mountains were constant companions on her quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wheel of her cart, each clop of the mule's hooves, was a step closer to a hope that felt as distant and improbable as the stars themselves.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the vastness of the galaxy remained a daunting challenge.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where the alluring promise of discovery battled against the cold, hard reality of the void.
