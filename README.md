
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her journey wasn't one of pilgrimage or conquest, but of desperate escape.  Whispers of a plague followed her, and she was fleeing towards a rumored sanctuary in the distant mountains, her meager possessions strapped to the saddle.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, sent shivers down her spine, a reminder of the precariousness of her perilous trek across a land scarred by war and disease.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential human colony, was measured not in days but in years, each hyperspace jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the void.  While danger was less visceral than Elara’s, the loneliness of deep space and the constant threat of equipment failure offered a different kind of terror.  The vastness of the galaxy, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a stark contrast to the contained anxieties of medieval travel.
