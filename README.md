
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand leagues, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track snaking through the whispering pines, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both his determination and a gnawing fear of the unknown dangers that lurked beyond the next crest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising signs of life beyond Earth's dying sun.  The jump to hyperspace had been brutal, the ship groaning under the strain of traversing lightyears in moments.  Ahead lay the unknown – alien civilizations, hostile environments, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the hope of discovering something extraordinary, spurred her on, a modern-day knight errant searching for a new dawn among the stars.
