
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and distant rain clinging to the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the glint of hope, fueled by unwavering loyalty and whispered legends, kept her pushing onward, her heart a drumbeat against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, his ship a tiny speck against the swirling nebula.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr, Rexx and his crew battled not only the cosmic elements but also the gnawing fear of the unknown. The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also terrifying isolation.  Survival depended on their skill, their teamwork, and a stubborn refusal to give up hope of finding their lost kin.
