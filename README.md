
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a rumored lost monastery said to contain ancient knowledge.  Each crest scaled, each treacherous river forded, brought her closer to her goal, but also closer to the bandits and wild beasts that roamed these desolate lands. The whispers of adventure, and the weight of her ambition, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost amidst the swirling gases and treacherous asteroid fields.  The vastness of space was a daunting, beautiful terror – the faint, distant light of distant galaxies a constant reminder of humanity's insignificance, yet also its boundless potential.  Eva's courage, and the hope of finding survivors, guided her through the cosmic expanse.
