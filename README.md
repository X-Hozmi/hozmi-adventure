
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind the creaking wagon wheels as Sir Kaelan and his small band journey across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present uncertainty of finding their way through treacherous, uncharted territories.  The journey tests not only their physical endurance but their courage and loyalty, forging bonds as strong as the steel of their swords.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' her course set for the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion as she navigates the treacherous nebulae and wormholes separating her from the Xylos system, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space presents a different kind of challenge – the threat of pirates, the unpredictable nature of warp currents, and the loneliness of navigating the endless black.  Success hinges not only on advanced technology but also on Ryla's unwavering resolve and the trust she shares with her eclectic crew.
