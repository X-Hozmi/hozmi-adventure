
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the whispered secrets of a hidden monastery, a map promising untold riches, and the gnawing fear of brigands and the unforgiving wilderness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each distant hawk cry, is a potential threat or a fleeting sign of hope on her perilous journey to the legendary city of Ys.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offers scant comfort against the ever-present shadow of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids is a daily routine, but the thrill of discovery outweighs the danger.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the ever-expanding universe.  The cold, indifferent vastness of space holds both unimaginable wonder and a chilling loneliness, a constant reminder of the perilous distances and the monumental risks inherent in galactic exploration.
