
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather jerkin chafing against her skin.  The map, a crudely drawn parchment, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sparked a fresh surge of adrenaline. Bandits were rumored to stalk these desolate lands, and the whispers of a mythical lost city, said to hold untold riches, fueled her perilous journey. The setting sun cast long, ominous shadows, promising a night fraught with danger and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of the galaxy still held a primal allure. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  His mission: to chart a new trade route across unmapped sectors, bringing valuable resources back to the burgeoning galactic empire, while simultaneously evading the predatory K'tharr pirates notorious for ambushing lone vessels in these treacherous regions. The cosmic expanse, breathtaking in its beauty, hid dangers as profound as any medieval wilderness.
