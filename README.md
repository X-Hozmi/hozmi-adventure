
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of hope, fueled by a sister's life, spurs him onward, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the breathtaking beauty of a medieval world seldom seen by most.


Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds among swirling nebulae and unmapped constellations.  Faster-than-light travel shrinks the distances between stars, yet each jump carries its own peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile civilizations. Yet the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, and the potential to find new homes for humanity propel Elara and her crew through the vast, uncharted cosmic ocean.
