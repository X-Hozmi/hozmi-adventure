
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Eldoria – a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill, the uncertainty of her quest a constant companion.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold a source of unimaginable energy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes was a daily occurrence.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant galaxies, fueled his insatiable thirst for exploration, a modern-day odyssey across the cosmic sea.
