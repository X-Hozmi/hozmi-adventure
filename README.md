
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils he faced, each sunrise bringing a new test of his endurance and courage.  The whispers of Eldoria, however, fueled his weary steps, promising a reward far outweighing the hardships of the journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying home planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unforgiving vacuum of space, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the unwavering hope for survival, mirroring the spirit of medieval adventurers facing their own daunting challenges.  The vastness of space, however, presented a different kind of peril, a lonely expanse far removed from the familiar comforts of home.
