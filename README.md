
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the coast she'd left behind weeks ago. Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle in the north, felt as endless as the seemingly infinite stretch of forest and rolling hills. Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow cast by the setting sun, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of disease.  But the thought of her people, their hope resting on her shoulders, spurred her onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck amidst the cosmic grandeur.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a perilous one, fraught with unpredictable asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle of technology, but the loneliness of interstellar space was a constant companion. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, and uncovering the mysteries of the ancient Xylos civilization fueled her drive, making the unimaginable distances feel a little less daunting.
