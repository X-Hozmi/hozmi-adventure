
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a poor substitute for the familiar comfort of her village.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the whispered tales of Zerzura's shimmering spires fueled her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos cluster was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape of the Galactic Federation, but the discovery of a lost Precursor civilization on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy outweighed any annoyance.  With a crew of hardened explorers and a thirst for the unknown, Ryla pushed the boundaries of known space, each jump through hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of reality, yet the promise of untold wonders and lost technologies pushed her ever forward.
