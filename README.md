
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track wound through a whispering forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery; bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable elements were constant companions on his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of dying stars.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, but the allure of discovery – of new worlds, new life – spurred her onward, a modern-day knight errant charting a course through the cosmic unknown.
