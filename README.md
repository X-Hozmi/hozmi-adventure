
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city of gold, or so the legends claimed.  His journey had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains swarming with bandits, and through dense forests where unseen eyes watched from the shadows.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a gnawing fear of the unknown, but the lure of Eldoria, and the chance to prove his worth, pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was treacherous, dodging asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of the nebula, all while battling the constant hum of the ship's failing hyperdrive.  The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable danger, but Eva, fueled by a thirst for discovery and a burning desire to find the lost colonists, held steadfastly to her course, charting a path through the uncharted cosmos.
