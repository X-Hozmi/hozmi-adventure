
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unpredictable terrain tested both beast and rider. Yet, with each creak of the saddle and rise of the sun, her resolve hardened, fueled by the promise of ancient secrets and untold riches waiting at the journey's end.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void, its hyperdrive a shimmering tear in the fabric of space-time.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a blur of hyperspace navigation and the hum of the ship's engines, was punctuated by the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and unforeseen gravitational anomalies. But the crew, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, pressed onward, driven by the insatiable human need to discover and the hope of finding a new home among the stars.
