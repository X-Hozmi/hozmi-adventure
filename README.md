
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in fiery hues. His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to overcome him.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred him onward, transforming the arduous journey into a pilgrimage of unwavering determination.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made this interstellar odyssey a perilous gamble. But the echoes of her ancestors' plight fueled her unwavering resolve, driving her towards the unknown corners of the galaxy.
