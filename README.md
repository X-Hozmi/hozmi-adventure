
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed passes, wild animals roamed the unforgiving terrain, and the biting winds threatened to sweep her from her saddle. Yet, the whispers of a lost city, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient knowledge, spurred her onward.  Each perilous river crossing, each treacherous climb, fueled her determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational currents and rogue asteroids, the vastness of space a humbling, awe-inspiring adversary.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across light years filled with the potential for engine failure, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation.  The galaxy was her playground, and the stakes, impossibly high.
