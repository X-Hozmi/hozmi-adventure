
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a rutted goat path, snaked through a landscape of brooding forests and craggy peaks.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger in his belly.  But the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky black of the void. Her mission: a multi-galaxy survey for habitable planets, a desperate search for humanity's future.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between stars, each jump a gamble against unforeseen cosmic phenomena.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also terrifying – a lonely ocean of potential hazards.  Yet, the weight of her species' survival rested on Eva's shoulders, propelling her forward across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
