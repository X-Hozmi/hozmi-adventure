Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst travelers, said to hold treasures beyond imagining, but also perils – brigands, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Captain Eva Rostova navigated by the faint starlight of distant galaxies, charting a course through nebulae and asteroid fields. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane seas of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.

Yet, the hope of discovering new life and unlocking the universe’s secrets fueled their relentless journey across the cosmos.
