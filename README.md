
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of glory and fortune, fueled his relentless journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling temporal distortions, and facing the unknown dangers of deep space, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration.  The vastness of the cosmos presented a different kind of hardship, but the spirit of adventure, the unyielding thirst for discovery, remained the same.
