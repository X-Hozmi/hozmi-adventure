
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin stiff with dust, urged his destrier onwards. The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only sounds the rhythmic clop of hooves and the rasp of his own breath.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – seemed impossibly daunting, the miles stretching before him like an endless tapestry of hardship, a test of both courage and endurance.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril, making each step a gamble against the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of a nebula.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  The cosmos, a breathtaking canvas of swirling colours and distant starlight, was both inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships were commonplace hazards.  But the true challenge wasn't the physical dangers, but the isolation – the vast, echoing emptiness between worlds, the constant reminder of the fragility of life, and the sheer audaciousness of her mission to reach the distant shores of a new galactic frontier.
