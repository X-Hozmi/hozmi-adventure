
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of knights pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of glory and fortune, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic K'tharr civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps sent jolts through the vessel, and the endless expanse of space, punctuated only by distant starlight, held both wonder and a terrifying sense of isolation. But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, held fast to her course, driven by the potential for discovery and the chance to forge a new era of galactic understanding.
