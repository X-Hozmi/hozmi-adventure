Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend among the villagers back home, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, fueled both his excitement and his apprehension. Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable nature of the terrain were constant companions on his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe, a journey fueled by a thirst for adventure and the promise of something more.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy sprawling before her.
