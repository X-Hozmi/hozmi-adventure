
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome had been arduous, fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested him to his limits.  Yet, the unwavering faith fueling his pilgrimage, the whispered legends of miraculous relics, and the promise of redemption kept him pressing forward, each creak of his saddle a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of medieval hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Vast distances were no match for her advanced FTL drive, but the unpredictable currents of hyperspace presented a different kind of danger – spatial distortions threatening to tear her vessel apart.  The mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a lonely outpost clinging to life on a harsh, alien world.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the shimmering beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, both inspired and humbled her – a testament to the boundless human drive to explore the cosmos.
