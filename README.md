
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of dried grass and woodsmoke heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guides her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable treasures.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential encounter – a friendly traveler, a desperate bandit, or a fantastical beast.  The journey is perilous, but the lure of the unknown burns brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *Stardust*, through a nebula of incandescent purple and gold.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of swirling galaxies and uncharted systems, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation challenges, unforeseen solar flares, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien life forms make every jump between star systems a gamble, a daring leap into the boundless enigma of the cosmos.
