
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onwards, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, each hardship forging a resilience only the open road could bestow.  The whispers of distant cities and the tales of legendary saints fueled her spirit, promising a reward beyond the physical challenges.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  But Eva, hardened by years spent charting unmapped star systems, felt the familiar exhilaration of the pioneer, the thrill of discovery echoing through her veins.  Each jump into hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a promise of alien landscapes and untold wonders awaiting her on the far side of the cosmos.
