
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey across the vast expanse of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable treasures, fueled her relentless trek, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The journey between galaxies was a marathon, not a sprint, demanding precise calculations and unwavering vigilance against unpredictable spacetime anomalies.  The potential rewards, however, were limitless:  new worlds teeming with undiscovered life, ancient technologies waiting to be unearthed, and the thrill of charting the unknown expanse of the cosmos – a legacy far greater than any earthly kingdom.
