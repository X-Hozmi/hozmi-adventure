
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, urged his weary steed onward. The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils, a welcome change from the stench of the battlefield he'd recently left behind.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the dense forest, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  Unlike Reginald's earthly challenges, Eva faced the vast, unknowable dangers of space – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien life.  Yet, the allure of discovery burned brighter than any fear.
