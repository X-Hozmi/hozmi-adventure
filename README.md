
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a village ravaged by plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed beauty and lurking dangers of the medieval world.  She was bound for the fabled city of Alexandria, a journey fraught with peril but brimming with the promise of a brighter tomorrow.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years away.  The hum of the hyperdrive resonated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  This was not a journey for survival, but for discovery – a quest to chart new worlds, to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.  The risks were immense, the unknowns terrifying, but the lure of the unexplored galaxies ignited a fire in Jax’s soul, propelling them ever onward into the inky blackness.
