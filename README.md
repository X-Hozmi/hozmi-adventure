
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a brittle scroll detailing the rumored location of a lost Celtic monastery, said to hold secrets older than Christendom itself.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the whispers of the forest held far more danger than any map could predict.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with the thrill of discovery and the ever-present thread of peril.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, jumped into hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity. The vast emptiness between stars held a different kind of danger - cosmic anomalies, pirate fleets, and the silent, crushing loneliness of the void. But the promise of new worlds, of life beyond the dying embers of Earth, fueled her every decision, a beacon in the infinite darkness.
