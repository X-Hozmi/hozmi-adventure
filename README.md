
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as her trusty steed, a grey mare named Storm, picked its way across the parched plains.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation were Elara's constant companions, but the lure of the lost city, and the ancient secrets it promised, fueled her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach her goal.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace;  the real danger lay in the unknown.  Whispers of temporal distortions and hostile alien lifeforms followed them like shadows, a constant reminder of the immense risks involved in their interstellar voyage.  But the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance, propelled them onward across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
