
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under a bruised sky, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  But the allure of Zerzura, and the glory that awaited its discoverer, propelled him forward, a solitary knight against the vastness of the medieval world.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a swirling nebula, the crimson and gold dust painting a breathtaking panorama across her viewport. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for humanity's burgeoning interstellar civilization.  The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life. Yet, like Sir Gareth before her, Eva pressed on, driven by the insatiable human hunger for exploration and the promise of discovery across the infinite expanse of space.
