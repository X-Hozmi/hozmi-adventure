
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Black Forest had been brutal;  weeks of relentless travel, battling storms and skirmishes with rival knights, all for the chance to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria and its fabled Sunstone.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in every shadow.  The promise of glory, and perhaps survival itself, spurred him on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and breathtaking alien landscapes.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the vastness of space instilled a different kind of fear, a loneliness amplified by the constant hum of the ship's engines.  The unknown lay ahead, a vast and potentially hostile expanse demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck to conquer.
