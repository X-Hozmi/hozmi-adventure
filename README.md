
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of fiery orange and blood red.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery clinging to the cliff face, said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the desperate hope in her heart fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the fabled Lost Colony of Kepler-186f, a settlement swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp drives hummed, the ship buffeted by gravitational tides as Jaxx plotted a course through asteroid fields and uncharted sectors.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, pressed in on him, a stark contrast to the cramped confines of his ship, the weight of his crew's hopes resting squarely on his shoulders.
