
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traverse the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each step is a gamble against the unforgiving terrain, the icy slopes a constant threat.  My meager supplies dwindle with each passing day, but the lure of the fabled Sunstone city, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, pushes me onward.  Wolves howl in the distance, a chilling reminder of the dangers that lurk in this unforgiving wilderness.  The journey is arduous, but the whispered promises of glory keep my spirit alive.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant, soothing thrum.  Stars streak past my viewport like cosmic fireflies as we jump between galaxies, the vast expanse of the universe a breathtaking, humbling sight.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope swallowed by the void decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and skirting nebulae brimming with unknown dangers is commonplace, yet the thrill of exploration never fades. The potential discovery of a new civilization, or even just a single surviving Xylosian, makes the inherent risks worthwhile. The cosmos is our playground, and the search is our adventure.
