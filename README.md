
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track.  Her hand, calloused from years spent guiding her pack mule, instinctively rested on the hilt of her father's dagger.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to swallow men whole, a legend etched in the grim faces of fellow travelers she'd encountered along the King's Road.  Yet, the promise of the fabled Sunstone, rumored to reside in the faraway monastery of Saint Elmo, spurred her onward, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the nearby woods, heightened the adventure, a thrilling dance between fear and unwavering hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Comet" Kepler piloted her starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been a gamble, a desperate mission to secure a vital energy source for a dying Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields, evading the wrath of the Kryll pirates, and decoding the ancient glyphs etched on a derelict alien vessel were all in a day's work for Comet and her crew.  The vast expanse of space, a canvas of swirling colors and unimaginable distances, held a terrifying beauty, a stark contrast to the familiar earth-bound struggles of the medieval age but fueled by the same burning human need for exploration and discovery.
