
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept moors.  Their destination: the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the crashing waves of the western coast.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous bogs swallowing whole horses, desperate bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glint of Ys's golden spires, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, fueled their weary hearts and spurred them onward despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted sectors beyond known space.  Navigating asteroid fields the size of small moons and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of rogue planets were just the beginning.  Pirate raids and the chilling silence of unexplored systems, filled with the potential of alien encounters, posed far greater threats to her crew than any medieval bandit ever could. The promise of finding the colonists, however, burned bright, guiding her through the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
