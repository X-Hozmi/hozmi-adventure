
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under a bruised sky, spurred his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jeweled relics, was strapped to the horse's flank, a weighty burden mirroring the gravity of his mission.  Bandits, rival knights, and the treacherous terrain itself were constant threats on his arduous journey from London to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fraught with peril and the promise of untold riches – or a swift and brutal end. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing fear of the dark.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its multi-hued gases a breathtaking yet deceptive backdrop to the treacherous asteroid field ahead.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to galactic peace or devastating war. The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of malfunctioning technology were far more daunting than any medieval bandit, yet the allure of discovery, the chance to shape the galaxy’s future, propelled her forward.
