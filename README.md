
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked plains stretching before her like a wrinkled parchment.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-growing distance separating her from home.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, or disaster.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylian crystals to the far-flung galactic colony of Aethel.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of space pirates tested his skill and nerve, each hyperspace transit a leap into the unknown.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable peril. The universe was his adventure, and his ship, his home in the infinite expanse.
