
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the devastating plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or worse.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city and the hope it offered fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Facing treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering resolve. The galaxy held infinite wonders, but also infinite dangers, and the journey to Kepler-186f was far from certain.
