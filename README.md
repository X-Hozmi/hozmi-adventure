
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Pyrenees mountains was far from over; bandits, treacherous passes, and dwindling supplies were constant companions. Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fuelled her onward.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the adventure she'd embarked on.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a world teeming with unknown life and resources, kept her crew focused.  The vast emptiness of space was a humbling experience, a constant reminder of humanity's insignificance against the backdrop of the universe's grandeur, yet also a testament to their unwavering courage and thirst for exploration.
