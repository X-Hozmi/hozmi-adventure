
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to Canterbury, a pilgrimage undertaken to atone for a family transgression, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating crumbling roads to bartering for meager rations in unfamiliar villages, forging a path not only across the land but through the very fabric of her own resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of rare isotopes across the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast distances were measured not in leagues, but in light-years, and the dangers were cosmic: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on interstellar trade routes.  Eva’s journey was a test of her navigational skills, her engineering prowess, and her unwavering courage in the face of the infinite, unforgiving expanse of space.
