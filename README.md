
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the hope that fueled his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new perils, but also the unwavering promise of a destination that might hold the key to salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a task fraught with the dangers of hostile alien lifeforms and malfunctioning ancient technology.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between vast distances, but the perilous nature of space exploration remained unchanged.  Eva’s courage, her crew's unwavering loyalty, and the cutting-edge technology at their disposal were their only allies in a cosmic quest that could determine the fate of entire solar systems.
