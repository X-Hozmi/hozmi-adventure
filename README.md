
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him after weeks on the road, squinted at the setting sun. Dust coated his lips, and the rhythmic clip-clop of his horse's hooves was a constant companion against the vast silence of the plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the breathtaking cosmic panorama outside her viewport. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering rogue asteroids or hostile alien patrols, but the promise of a unified galaxy pushed her and her crew onward, charting a course across unmapped sectors and unexplored galaxies.
