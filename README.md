
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her safekeeping on this perilous journey to the distant city of  Porthaven, seeking a legendary healer for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles she faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainties of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, AURORA, calmly charting their course across the vast emptiness of interstellar space.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital element from the planet Kepler-186f, crucial to sustaining life on a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel masked the true scale of their journey, but the risks remained substantial;  uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien civilizations posed significant threats to their survival and the success of their mission.
