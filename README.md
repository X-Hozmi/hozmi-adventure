
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each sunrise brought the promise of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the glory that would follow its discovery, fueled his every step across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  He carried with him only a battered map, a dwindling supply of dried meat, and an unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's engines humming a low, powerful song.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of bending space-time.  The vast emptiness of interstellar space was punctuated only by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and unforeseen cosmic phenomena.  But the promise of discovery, and the potential to change the fate of humanity, drove her onward, a lone voyager in the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
