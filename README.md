
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the fractured kingdom.  The wind, a biting knife against my face, carried the scent of pine and damp earth, a stark contrast to the stench of the war-torn villages we'd passed.  My companions, a motley crew of mercenaries and pilgrims, trudged onward, their faces etched with the same mixture of hope and weariness that mirrored my own. We sought the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal our ravaged land, a legendary treasure guarded by treacherous terrain and more dangerous foes.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we navigated the shimmering void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae painted breathtaking tapestries across the viewport, a spectacle both awe-inspiring and humbling.  Our mission, far removed from the petty squabbles of medieval kingdoms, was to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for a dwindling human race.  The vastness of space, though breathtaking, felt oppressive at times, the weight of our responsibility a heavier burden than any earthly mountain.
