
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked tracks as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched his worn map, its edges frayed from countless miles traversed, his gaze fixed on the distant, snow-capped peaks.  Rumours of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and forgotten magic, had lured him from his humble village, a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes, a gamble with his life for a whisper of possibility.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill – and the terror – of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kryll crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril, dodging asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravitational wells, and facing the ever-present threat of pirate raiders amongst the stars. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes glimpsed from her viewport, spurred her on, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the incredible.
