
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, pressed onward through the muddied track.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our destination, the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to exist only in legend, fueled our relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The clink of steel against steel, the whinny of horses, and the hushed whispers of ancient prophecies were the soundtrack to our desperate quest.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our pathways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unmapped Kepler-186f.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion as we leaped between star systems, dodging asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Our mission: to locate a rumored source of Xylos crystals, powerful energy sources coveted across the galaxy. The vast, cold expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and the promise of untold riches, testing the limits of our courage and our ship's technology.
