
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of St. Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each hushed whisper in a village tavern, added to the tapestry of his adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers and surprising kindnesses that awaited him across the vast, uncharted landscapes of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a perilous journey across unmapped galaxies fraught with rogue asteroids and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  The breathtaking vistas of celestial bodies, the chilling silence of deep space, and the thrill of navigating treacherous wormholes far surpassed any terrestrial adventure.  Her journey wasn't just about survival; it was about pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
