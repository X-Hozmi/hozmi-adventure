
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling my nostrils.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Black Forest promised both shelter and peril.  My companions, a grizzled knight and a wizened scholar, rode beside me, our meager supplies lashed to our mounts.  We journeyed to Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones, seeking a legendary artifact rumored to hold the power to heal the land ravaged by plague.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the allure of the unknown spurred us onward.

A thousand years hence, the stars themselves were our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness between galaxies, a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, indifferent cosmos.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets after a catastrophic rift tore through their system.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the possibility of reuniting a scattered people, of piecing together their fragmented history, fueled my engines and ignited my soul.
