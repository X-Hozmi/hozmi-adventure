
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the faint hope of reaching his elusive destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering strange alien lifeforms, and battling the relentless decay of her aging vessel were just some of the perils she faced.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, but also the ever-present threat of oblivion.
