
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease.  Yet, the whisper of the distant ocean, the lure of a rumored lost city, spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast tapestry of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae painted a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigation charts pulsed with holographic starlight, while the ship's AI hummed a low warning of impending gravitational tides and unpredictable wormhole activity.  The vast, indifferent universe held dangers far beyond anything medieval travelers could have imagined, but the thrill of discovery and the promise of untold knowledge fueled Ryla's relentless pursuit of the unknown.
