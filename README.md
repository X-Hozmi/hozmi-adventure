
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack.  Yet, the promise of salvation spurred her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across scorching deserts, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating by the faintest glimmers of quasars, she steered her crew towards Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life.  The jump to hyperspace was a terrifying gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. But the potential discovery of a new civilization, one that might hold the key to galactic peace, overshadowed the risk.  The cosmos was a vast ocean, and the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny vessel charting its unmapped depths.
