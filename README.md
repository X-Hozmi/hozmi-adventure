
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey from the bustling markets of Constantinople to the mysterious monasteries of Santiago de Compostela.  Her quest for a legendary healing herb, whispered about in hushed tones, pushed her onward, despite the constant challenges and the gnawing loneliness of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes was a daily routine, but the thrill of discovery never dulled.  Her mission: to locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth. Each jump to a new star system brought the promise of breathtaking landscapes—from gas giants swirling with vibrant colours to ice worlds shimmering under alien suns—and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile life forms.  The vastness of space was both exhilarating and terrifying, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her responsibility.
