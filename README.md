
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the sea.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the whisper of the city's magic, the promise of untold riches and forgotten lore, spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the land, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing systems ravaged by cosmic radiation were all in a day's work.  But the breathtaking vistas of alien landscapes and the promise of establishing a new human colony far outweighed the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace, each careful course correction, was a leap into the boundless expanse, a testament to human courage in the face of unimaginable distances.
