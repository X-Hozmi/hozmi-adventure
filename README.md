
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights crested the hill, the sprawling, sun-baked landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before them.  Their quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey that would take them across treacherous mountain passes, through shadowed forests teeming with bandits, and across rivers swollen with spring thaw.  Each day brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, skirmishes with rival warlords, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Their only solace lay in the unwavering camaraderie forged in the face of adversity, and the unwavering belief in their sacred mission.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission, far more complex than Sir Kaelan's, was to secure a rare mineral vital to the survival of the fledgling Terran colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey spanned light-years, demanding precise navigation through asteroid fields and harrowing encounters with hostile alien patrols.  Unlike Kaelan, Eva relied on advanced technology and a crew of diverse specialists, each crucial to the success of their interstellar voyage.  Yet, the core of their adventure remained the same: the relentless pursuit of a vital objective in the face of unimaginable obstacles.
