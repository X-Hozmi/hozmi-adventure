Her journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, from bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages to navigating by the stars in the trackless wilderness.

The potential riches of the new world, and the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, outweighed the fear of the unknown.  They were pushing the boundaries of human exploration, forging a path into the cosmic void.
