
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He'd left the familiar comfort of his village weeks ago, a pouch of meager coin his only companion besides the battered map clutched in his frost-nipped hand.  His quest?  To find the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the blight ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the hope of salvation fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly years ago. Navigating the treacherous cosmic currents and dodging rogue asteroid fields, Eva and her crew faced a far different kind of hardship – technological failures, the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, and the chilling unknown of what lay beyond the anomaly’s edge.  But the faint hope of finding survivors, of uncovering a lost civilization, kept them pushing onward.
