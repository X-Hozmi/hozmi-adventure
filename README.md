
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming dully under the overcast sky, urged his destrier onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the gleam of Eldoria's promise, fueled by hope and a desperate need, kept him and his weary companions pushing forward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation. Their mission: to locate and secure a rare element vital to sustaining life on their overpopulated homeworld.  Warp drives hummed, and the ship shuddered gently as they jumped between galaxies, each jump a gamble against the unforgiving void.  The dangers were not bandits and starvation, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the sheer vastness of space itself – a constant reminder of the fragility of existence against the awe-inspiring scale of the cosmos.
