
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Rocamadour – was fraught with peril.  The sun beat down mercilessly, the landscape offering little respite, but the thought of her family’s safety spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.  She navigated treacherous mountain passes and forded raging rivers, relying on her wits and the kindness of strangers as much as her worn map.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, his knuckles white against the worn metal.  The jump to the Xylos system was a risky one, a shortcut through a volatile nebula.  He peered at the swirling cosmic chaos outside, the swirling colours a beautiful but deadly threat.  His crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, held their breath.  The success of their mission – the retrieval of the legendary Xylos crystals – rested on this perilous journey, a gamble against the immense power and unpredictability of the cosmos.  The stakes were as high as the stars themselves.
