
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his armor rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, rumored to swallow men whole, and beyond that, the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold secrets lost to time.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and the thrill of discovery. The journey was a tapestry woven with fear and excitement, a constant gamble against starvation, bandits, and the unforgiving elements.  He rode towards the unknown, his heart pounding a rhythm against the pounding hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space pressed in, a silent, star-dusted ocean surrounding her tiny vessel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien encounters.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
