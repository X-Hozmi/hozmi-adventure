
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's illness.  Each day brought new challenges; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the glint of hope in his sister's eyes fueled his journey, pushing him further despite the immense hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the backdrop of swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to establish first contact with the elusive Zydonian civilization on the far side of the galaxy.

But the promise of discovery, the potential to reshape the future of humanity, propelled her forward into the uncharted cosmos.
