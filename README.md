
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I urged my mule onward.  The biting wind whipped across the plains of Hungary, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and the distant echo of wolves. My journey to Constantinople, undertaken to find my estranged brother, was fraught with peril.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits,  each nightfall the chilling uncertainty of finding safe shelter.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered tales of exotic cities and ancient wonders, spurred me onwards, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, in 2742, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we jumped between galaxies, the vast emptiness punctuated only by the occasional nebula or the spectral glow of a distant quasar. My mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The risks were immense—navigational hazards, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving expanse of space.  But the potential discovery of a lost civilization, the promise of untold knowledge, made the unimaginable journey worthwhile.
