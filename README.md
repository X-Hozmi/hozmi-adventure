
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as he guides his weary steed across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria and recover the Sunstone, has taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the unforgiving grip of a relentless summer.  Each day brings new challenges: skirmishes with rival knights, navigating the labyrinthine paths of ancient ruins, and bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages.  His companions, a grizzled veteran and a cunning rogue, remain his only solace against the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, the *Hope*, lost amongst the uncharted star systems beyond the Orion Arm.  The journey is fraught with peril – navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and contending with the unpredictable gravitational forces of newly discovered planets.  The vast emptiness of space amplifies the isolation, but Eva's crew, a diverse team of specialists, remain united by their shared purpose and the unwavering hope of finding survivors amidst the cosmic expanse.
