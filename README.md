
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, spurred his destrier onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant battle.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  Survival demanded not only courage but cunning, every step a gamble against the harsh realities of a medieval journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a diplomatic mission to the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light years away across the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey wasn't perilous in the same way as Kaelan's – no bandits, no rivers to ford – but the vastness of space held its own dangers.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure kept the crew on edge.  Their success depended on advanced technology and unwavering teamwork, a far cry from the solitary struggles of a medieval knight.
