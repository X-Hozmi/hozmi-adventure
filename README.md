
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for the arduous journey to Avignon to plead for aid against the encroaching blight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of leaves in the wind, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandit raids, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road ahead.  The adventure wasn't just about reaching her destination, but surviving the journey itself.

Conversely, Captain Rexx felt the gentle hum of the Althea's hyperdrive as they leaped across the vast chasm of interstellar space.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to achieving faster-than-light travel.  The thrill wasn't the physical journey, but the intellectual challenge – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering ancient alien star charts, and outwitting the ruthless K'tharr pirates who patrolled these uncharted regions.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but equally countless dangers, making each jump a gamble between triumph and oblivion.
