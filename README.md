
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of parched earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense forests teeming with brigands, and across vast, unforgiving plains.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of rival knights – but the unwavering gleam of his purpose spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, the vast emptiness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at the crew.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of the lost colony, fueled their journey across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
