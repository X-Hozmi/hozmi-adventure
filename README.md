
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and damp earth, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering forests of the Ardennes, leading him towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey, each hardship a test of his courage and resolve.  The promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge, however, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and managing the ship's increasingly temperamental hyperdrive were all in a day's work. The vastness of space held both incredible beauty and unimaginable dangers, but the potential discovery of new life –  a new beginning – spurred her on through the cosmic void.
