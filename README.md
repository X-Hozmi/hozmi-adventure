Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll – the endless churn of wagon wheels across rutted tracks, the biting winds sweeping across the desolate plains, the constant threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.

The universe was a vast canvas, and she was merely beginning to paint her masterpiece.
