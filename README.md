
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her mule straining under the weight of meager supplies.  Bandits are a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain a challenge in itself, and the whispered rumors of a mythical city lost in the valleys fuel her relentless journey.  Each sunrise brings a new test of endurance, a new vista of rugged beauty, and a renewed hope that the fabled riches – or simply the chance to escape her past – lie just beyond the next ridge.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation is a delicate dance between gravitational pulls and hyperspace jumps, each one a gamble against unforeseen cosmic anomalies.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the far side of the galaxy, a journey fraught with pirate attacks and the ever-present threat of spatial distortion.  But the lure of the unknown, the potential for discovery, and the promise of unimaginable wealth outweigh the risks for this intrepid explorer charting the unmapped territories of the cosmos.
