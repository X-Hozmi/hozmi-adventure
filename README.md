
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the whispered legends of Eldoria's healing waters, spurred him relentlessly across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining spores to the newly colonized planet of Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirate attacks were all part of a day's work.  But the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the weight of her responsibility, and the promise of a new beginning for humanity on a distant world fueled her tireless journey across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
