
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the mythical city of Eldoria.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped compass, a well-thumbed map riddled with scribbled notes, and the hope that whispered legends of Eldoria's healing waters were true. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the endless expanse of the landscape tested her resilience, but the promise of adventure, of discovering something extraordinary beyond the familiar, fueled her onward. Each sunrise offered a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her perseverance.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* across the chasm of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable currents of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of pirate factions vying for control of the galaxy's trade routes.  The vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos held a boundless allure, a siren song tempting her to explore the unknown, even at the risk of never returning.
