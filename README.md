
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey to the faraway kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring thaw, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and relying on the kindness (or tolerance) of strangers.  Their quest, to retrieve a sacred relic, felt as vast and daunting as the landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the edge of explored space, a journey requiring traversing multiple star systems and navigating treacherous asteroid fields.  Advanced technology mitigated some of the hardship, but the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of warp travel still presented immense challenges.  The solitude of deep space, punctuated by the occasional burst of comms static, was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the bustling spaceports she left behind. The fate of the colonists rested on her shoulders, and the weight of that responsibility felt as heavy as the stars themselves.
