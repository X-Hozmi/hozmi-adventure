
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her small band of companions, a motley crew of knights, mercenaries, and a surprisingly knowledgeable apothecary, pressed on.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague devastating their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the promise of Ys fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Nebula steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists, engineers, and mercenaries,  were on a mission far more ambitious than reaching a distant city: they sought the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-jump incident.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and deciphering alien languages were all in a day's work for Nova, but the sheer vastness of space, the profound isolation, and the unknown dangers of unexplored galaxies constantly tested their courage and resolve.
