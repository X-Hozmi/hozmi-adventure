
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had become an adventure far exceeding their expectations.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rough terrain tested both horse and rider.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager sustenance in remote villages.  The tales spun by weary travelers around crackling fires each night only fueled their anticipation of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Her mission: to chart a course to the Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates were daily occurrences, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable cosmos, driven by the promise of discovery and the unyielding human thirst for exploration.
