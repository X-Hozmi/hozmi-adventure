
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, a barely discernible path through the dense Ardennes forest, was treacherous, choked with mud and shadowed by ancient oaks.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers – both human and wild – that lurked in the untamed wilderness between him and his salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of the swirling nebula.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vast emptiness of space was a different kind of wilderness, filled with unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential rewards – new worlds, new life – made the risks worthwhile.
