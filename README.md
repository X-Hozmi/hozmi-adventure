
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as it rumbled across the parched Provençal countryside.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, the threat of disease clung to the air like a miasma, and the sheer distance felt insurmountable. Yet, with each creak of the wheel, each sunrise painting the sky in fiery hues, her spirit soared.  The whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten kingdoms fueled her onward, the unknown a siren's call stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Janson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant.  The jump to hyperspace was a breathtaking spectacle of swirling colours and impossible speed, followed by the chilling emptiness of interstellar space.  Ahead lay the unknown: the potential for lucrative discovery, the ever-present danger of pirates, and the looming mystery of the station itself, its silence a more profound threat than any weapon.
