
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city of gold and forgotten magic.  His small band, a motley collection of seasoned mercenaries and wide-eyed novices, pressed on, facing down bandits, braving treacherous mountain passes, and navigating the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. The journey itself, a tapestry woven with danger and camaraderie, was as much a reward as the mythical city itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy rumored to exist on a remote, uncharted planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders and terrifying unknowns, was a constant companion on her perilous, galaxy-spanning quest.
