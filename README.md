
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the distant abbey of Saint Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and revelation as he journeyed across the unforgiving landscape, relying on his wits, his sword, and the kindness of strangers – or their fear – to guide him.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and grappling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all part of a day's work.  The vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the cutthroat realities of interstellar trade, as Elara pushed the boundaries of known space, her destiny as uncertain as the swirling colours outside her viewport.
