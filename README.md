
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – starvation in this desolate wilderness. The journey was fraught with peril, but the chance of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents between galaxies, she pushed the vessel to its limits, chasing whispers of a lost civilization rumored to possess technology capable of ending the intergalactic war.  The vast emptiness of space was a different kind of peril than Elara's; the threat of void-born creatures, malfunctioning warp drives, and the ever-present danger of enemy ships made each jump a gamble. But the promise of peace, however distant, drove her forward through the cosmic dark.
