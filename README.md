
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a tapestry woven with hardship and the intoxicating allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden, catastrophic solar flare.  The journey was fraught with dangers – asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure – but the potential discovery of survivors, and the unveiling of the colony's fate, fueled her unwavering determination to push forward into the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of the cosmos.
