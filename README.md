
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the tattered map, its faded ink promising riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the grueling rhythm of travel:  dodging bandits in shadowed forests, bartering for meager rations in dusty villages, and sleeping under a sky ablaze with unfamiliar constellations.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the lure of the unknown fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, echoing silence of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate vessels, and maintaining the delicate balance of life support were daily challenges. But for Eva, the thrill of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach among the stars, far outweighed the inherent risks of interstellar travel.
