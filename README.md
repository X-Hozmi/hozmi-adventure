
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The promised bounty of spices in the faraway Sultanate of Delhi burned brighter in his mind than the aching blisters on his feet.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were small price to pay for the fortune that awaited.  Each sunrise painted the horizon with the hope of reaching his destination, a hope tempered by the harsh reality of the unforgiving landscape and the constant need for vigilance.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian warships felt commonplace compared to the exhilarating thrill of charting unmapped galaxies.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a mesmerizing beauty, each star a potential new world, each nebula a breathtaking canvas painted across the cosmic dark. The risks were immense, but the reward—a leap into the future of interstellar travel—was worth the gamble.
