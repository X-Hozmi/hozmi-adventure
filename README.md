
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous, mountain pass.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but vital herbs for a plague-stricken village – a journey undertaken not for riches, but for compassion.  Bandits lurk in the shadows, and the biting wind threatens frostbite, but the sight of distant monastery, a beacon of hope, fuels her onward.  Each creak of saddle leather, each thunderclap echoing through the jagged peaks, is a heartbeat of her perilous, yet purposeful adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but light-years.  The ship groans under the strain of warp drive, while alien anomalies flicker on the scanners, presenting unknown dangers.  But the hope of reunion with lost kin, and the thrill of charting unmapped cosmic territories, outweighs the immense risks.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space is his battlefield, and survival his ultimate prize.
