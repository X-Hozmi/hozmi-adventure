
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the King's ailing son.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of glory, spurred them onward, their determination etched onto their weathered faces.  The journey was as much a test of their mettle as it was a race against time.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a fleeing colony, escaping the dying embers of their homeworld.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with unpredictable gravitational currents and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien forces.  Each jump was a gamble, each new system a potential graveyard. Yet, the hope of survival, the dream of a new beginning, fueled her and her crew, driving them across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
