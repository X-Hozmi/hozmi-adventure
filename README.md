
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the Black Forest, its ancient trees clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh shiver down his spine – not just from the chill wind, but from the rumors of brigands and worse that haunted this untamed land.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues of cosmic dust painted a breathtaking, if somewhat terrifying, backdrop to their journey across the Andromeda galaxy. Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy.  While the dangers of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational forces paled in comparison to the medieval perils of Sir Reginald, the vastness of space and the unknown presented a different kind of fear – the chilling expanse of the infinite, a journey where even the tiniest malfunction could mean oblivion.
