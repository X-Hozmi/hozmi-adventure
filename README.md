
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map – a lifeline in this vast, unforgiving land.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  But the whispered rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, fueled her relentless journey across the kingdoms, a quest that demanded courage, cunning, and a stubborn refusal to yield to despair.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae of Xylos, she steered clear of cosmic storms and pirate fleets, her crew a ragtag bunch united by a shared thirst for discovery and a hefty bounty.  The rhythmic hum of the warp drive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the excited chatter as they approached a newly charted planet, a world potentially teeming with alien life forms, ancient ruins, and untold riches – the ultimate prize for daring explorers charting the unmapped expanse of the cosmos.
