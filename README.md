
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a ravaged village and the looming shadow of the Black Death. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, her determination burned brighter, fueled by the unwavering belief that a better future awaited beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around his starship.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  The vast emptiness of space was punctuated only by the hypnotic hum of the ship's engines and the occasional flicker of distant suns.  Facing treacherous asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction, Jaxx pressed onward, driven by the hope of finding survivors and the knowledge that even the furthest reaches of the cosmos could not diminish the enduring strength of the human spirit.
