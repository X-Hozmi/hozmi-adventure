
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his horse weary, pressed on through the unforgiving Ardennes Forest.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, the whispers of bandits and wild beasts a constant companion on his journey to reclaim his stolen inheritance.  The rough-hewn tracks were treacherous, the days brutally hot and the nights bitterly cold.  His quest was a test of endurance, a gamble against the unpredictable elements and the malice of men, but the promise of his ancestral lands fuelled his onward progress.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the journey between galaxies still demanded careful planning and a touch of daring.  Warp storms were a constant threat, and the uncharted regions held dangers as yet unknown to humankind.  Yet, the lure of discovering new worlds, new life, and potentially new enemies pushed Eva and her crew ever onward into the breathtaking vastness of space.
