
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a King's writ, a commission to deliver vital supplies to a besieged castle far in the north.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the very air crackled with the rumours of war.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a testament to the constant peril of medieval travel – a journey measured not in miles, but in the near-misses and the sheer grit required to survive.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast emptiness of space.  But the emptiness wasn't truly empty.  Rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates – all hazards just as deadly, if far more technologically advanced, than anything faced by a medieval traveler.  Elara's journey was a different kind of adventure, defined by the relentless march of technology against the awe-inspiring, and sometimes terrifying, scale of the cosmos.
