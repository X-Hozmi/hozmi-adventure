
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her quest – to find the legendary lost city of Zerzura – led her through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the suspicious gaze of countless villagers.  Each day brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadows, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, but the allure of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones, fueled her relentless journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet beyond the known galaxy's edge.  Warp drives hummed, battling gravitational tugs as they jumped between star systems, each jump a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the constant threat of pirate attacks – all paled in comparison to the thrilling possibility of discovering a new home for humankind amidst the endless stars.
