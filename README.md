
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by hope and the unwavering belief in their mission.  The vast, unknown landscape held both peril and promise, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal detected only as a faint whisper of energy.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, dodging pirate vessels and battling temporal anomalies, she pushed the boundaries of known space.  The cosmos, a breathtaking expanse of vibrant colors and silent wonders, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a stark reminder of the immense scale of the universe and the insignificance of a single ship within it.
