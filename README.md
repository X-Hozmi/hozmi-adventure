
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria had been arduous, fraught with peril from brigands and treacherous terrain.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating dense forests teeming with wild beasts, fording icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and bartering for meager provisions in sparsely populated villages.  The lure of Eldoria, however, with its promise of untold riches and magical artifacts, fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with challenges far beyond bandits and blizzards.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate incursions demanded constant vigilance, while the sheer vastness of space, the lonely expanse between worlds, pressed heavily on the crew.  Yet, the hope of creating a new home amongst the stars, a haven for humanity, kept them pushing forward into the unknown.
