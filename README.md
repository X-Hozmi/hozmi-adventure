
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, crinkled and stained with spilled wine, was her only guide to the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each hesitant step across a treacherous mountain pass, represented a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  But the lure of the Silk Road, of untold riches and exotic spices, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own dangers – rogue energy storms, alien scavengers, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  Yet, the promise of unlocking the universe’s deepest secrets fueled Eva’s relentless journey across the star-strewn canvas of the cosmos.
