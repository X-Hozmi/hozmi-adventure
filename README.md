
The creaking of the wagon wheels was a constant companion, a rhythmic counterpoint to the wind whistling through the gaps in Sir Kaelan's chainmail.  His journey across the craggy peaks and sun-baked plains of Aerthos was far from luxurious.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the mythical Sunstone city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, spurred him onward, a beacon promising glory and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Unlike Sir Kaelan's arduous trek, her journey was measured in warp jumps, each a momentary breach of spacetime depositing her closer to her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – but the thrill of exploration, the yearning for the unknown, burned just as brightly within her.
