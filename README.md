
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the packhorse behind, a tempting prize for the bandits rumored to infest the Black Forest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him. This journey across the unforgiving landscape, fraught with peril and hardship, was far more thrilling than any joust in the royal court.  He wasn't just delivering goods; he was carving his own legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been flawless, but the whispers of the Kryll, a sentient space-faring fungus, still echoed in her comms. Their home planet, a jewel-toned world orbiting a binary sun, lay just beyond the next jump point, a prize worth risking the Kryll's wrath to obtain. The vastness of space, the unknown dangers lurking in the cosmic darkness, paled in comparison to the thrill of exploration – a legacy far grander than any medieval knight could ever hope for.
