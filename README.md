
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred by whispers of a mythical city of gold lost to the sands, trudged onward.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation in the unforgiving wilderness.  Our horses, once magnificent steeds, were now gaunt shadows, mirroring the dwindling hope in our hearts. Yet, the lure of the legendary El Dorado, a city shimmering with untold riches, pushed us relentlessly towards the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova, her face etched with the weariness of countless jumps, stared out at the swirling nebulae, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Their mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate colony fleeing a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravity wells of uncharted systems presented challenges far exceeding any medieval knight's trials, but the stakes were far higher – the survival of an entire civilization.
