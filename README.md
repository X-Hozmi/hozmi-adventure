
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the packhorse behind, a tempting prize for the bandits who infested the Black Forest.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him. This journey to the distant port of Marseilles wasn't about glory, but survival – a desperate race against time and the shadows that clung to the edges of the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, uncaring expanse of space. But the thrill wasn't just the distance; it was the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for discovery – or annihilation.  The universe was a breathtaking, terrifying tapestry woven with stardust and the echoes of long-dead civilizations, a journey far more perilous than any medieval knight could ever imagine.
