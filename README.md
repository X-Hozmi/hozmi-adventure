
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the unrest in our hearts.  Rumors of bandits plague our journey, whispered alongside tales of hidden monasteries and fabled cities.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown, the risk of ambush balanced by the allure of distant markets and the promise of untold riches. The clatter of hooves on hard-packed earth is the soundtrack to our adventure, a symphony of hope and apprehension playing out against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries hence, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cuts a lonely path through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Nebulae paint breathtaking canvases across the viewport, while alien worlds, each a unique jewel, beckon from the distance.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the vastness of space.  My quest?  To find the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a journey fraught with danger from both the unpredictable nature of space itself and the unknown entities that may lurk in the shadows between stars.
