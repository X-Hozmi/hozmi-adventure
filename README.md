
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the relentless journey.  Ahead, the Alps loomed, a formidable wall of snow and rock between me and the promised silks of the Orient.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were my constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown, the whispers of legendary cities and untold riches, fueled my onward push. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, a renewed determination to reach my destination, no matter the cost.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos was a challenge even for Captain Eva Rostova, but the potential rewards - a lost colony rumored to possess technology far surpassing our own - were worth the risk.  Beyond the shimmering gas clouds lay uncharted galaxies, teeming with alien life both beautiful and terrifying.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a chilling loneliness, but the pursuit of knowledge, the relentless search for the extraordinary, propelled our tiny vessel across the uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
