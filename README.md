The map, a crudely drawn parchment, promised riches in the distant kingdom of Eldoria, riches that could save his family from starvation.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled his relentless journey across the treacherous landscape.  He clutched a small, worn crucifix, a silent prayer for safe passage a constant companion.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted across her viewport were breathtaking, a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of the cockpit. Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies in search of habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the potential for encountering hostile alien life or catastrophic system failures. But the weight of humanity's future rested on her shoulders, propelling her further into the vast, uncharted cosmos.
