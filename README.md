
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to recover the stolen Orb of Aethelred, a relic said to hold the very essence of the kingdom's prosperity.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but minor obstacles in his determined pursuit; the glory awaiting him at journey's end fueled his every stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the elusive Xylan civilization, rumored to possess technology capable of interstellar warp travel.

The vastness of space held both immense peril and unimaginable rewards, making every voyage a gamble against the odds.
