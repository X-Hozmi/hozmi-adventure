
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his chainmail rattling, spurred his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the pack horse behind him.  Their journey from the besieged city of Carcassonne was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed wood, and the whispers of plague stalked their every step.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the hope of reaching the safety of the King’s fortress.  His loyal squire, Thomas, rode beside him, their shared journey forging a bond stronger than steel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political machinations brewing back on Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, fuelled by her unwavering determination, pressed on, knowing that the fate of humanity might rest on her shoulders.
