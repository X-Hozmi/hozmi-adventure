
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Reginald's throat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across swift, icy rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest, where whispers of witchcraft and brigands were as chilling as the night air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure, yet the glint of the saint's sacred silver spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, a silver sliver against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates demanded precision and courage.  The vast emptiness of space, however, was far more daunting than any earthly wilderness, a constant reminder of humanity's fragility against the immeasurable scale of the cosmos.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting the unknown, fueled her onward, a modern-day knight on a galactic quest.
