
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hurried annotations, guides her towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each step is a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume her.  The scent of pine and damp earth fills her lungs, a stark contrast to the whispers of ancient magic that supposedly cling to the city’s ruins.  The journey is arduous, but the promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kerrigan pilots the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of distant stars is a daily challenge.  The hum of the ship's engines and the endless panorama of cosmic wonders are a constant reminder of the vastness of space and the perilous nature of interstellar travel.  But the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, drives her and her crew forward, even in the face of unimaginable risks.
