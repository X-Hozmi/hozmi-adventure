
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s weary steed as he urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked his every step, yet the whispered tales of Ys’s untold riches and powerful magic fueled his relentless drive. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, and each nightfall, a renewed sense of the daunting task ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull shimmering under the alien light of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable planet light-years away.  The vastness of space held its own dangers; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of unknown entities lurked in the inky blackness. But the potential discovery of new life, new resources, and the expansion of human civilization spurred Eva and her crew onward, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
