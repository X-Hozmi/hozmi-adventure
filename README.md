
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in her determined pursuit. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a renewed commitment to reach her destination, fueled by the unwavering love for her kin.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the 'Stardust Wanderer'.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Warp jumps tossed the vessel through spacetime, each a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien encounters.  The vastness of space, a constant companion, dwarfed even her courage, yet the weight of responsibility for her crew and the future of her people pushed her onward, towards the uncharted territories promising salvation.
