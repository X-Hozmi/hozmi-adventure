
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her leather-bound map, crinkled and worn from weeks of relentless travel, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the whisper of the lost city of Ys, rumored to hold unimaginable treasures, fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Wanderer'. The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of shimmering gas clouds and distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and treacherous.  Wormholes offered shortcuts across unimaginable distances, but each jump was a gamble, a dice roll against the unpredictable forces of spacetime.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethel, whispered to possess technology beyond human comprehension.  The vastness of space was a lonely expanse, but the lure of discovery, the potential to rewrite history, burned brighter than any star.
