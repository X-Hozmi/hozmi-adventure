
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance. Days bled into weeks, marked only by the shifting landscapes – dense forests giving way to sun-baked valleys, the rhythmic clang of their horses' hooves the only constant companion to the hushed whispers of the wind.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes were mere inconveniences compared to the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the unwavering faith that fueled their arduous trek provided a strength that surpassed physical limitations.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f. Navigating the chaotic gravitational pull of the binary stars and dodging asteroid fields was child's play compared to the sentient energy storms that lurked within the nebula itself.  The thrill of exploration, the vastness of space, and the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human understanding far outweighed the dangers.  Each jump to hyperspace brought her closer to her goal, and further into the boundless mysteries of the cosmos.
