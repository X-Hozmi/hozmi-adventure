
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan's small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed two of their number to fever and starvation.  Each sunrise brought the promise of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, yet the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold, and the whisper of its healing waters, spurred them relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape. Every creak of their saddles, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and untold riches.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets, Eva's crew faced the constant threat of system failures and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life.  The vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy promised both unimaginable discovery and catastrophic failure, a gamble worthy of the potential reward.
