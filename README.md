
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey across the vast and treacherous kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins of Aerilon, spurred them onward, promising untold riches and glory if they could only survive the journey.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by a centuries-old map passed down through generations of her family.  The journey between galaxies was a perilous dance with cosmic anomalies and aggressive alien patrols, but the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a new Eden amongst the stars, outweighed the risks.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
