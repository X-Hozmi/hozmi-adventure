
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her weary horse onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the legendary city and the ancient secrets it held. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant reminder of the precarious balance between life and death on this arduous journey.


Thousands of years later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing vital systems in the unforgiving vacuum of space were daily challenges.  The vastness of the universe, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the risks, fueling Rexx's unwavering determination to reach her destination, a gamble on the future of humanity itself.
