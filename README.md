
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor caked in mud and his spirit weary, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scrolls of  King Solomon.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the allure of the unknown, the whisper of untold riches and ancient wisdom, spurred him onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Sol system.  Warp drives hummed, a symphony of controlled chaos as she navigated asteroid fields and navigated the treacherous political currents of interstellar diplomacy.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue planets, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the promise of forging new alliances and uncovering the secrets of the cosmos, fuelled her unwavering determination.
