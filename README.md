
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a vital message for a distant lord, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowy forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – negotiating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in hushed villages, and always, the gnawing fear of losing her way, and with it, her purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, charting a course through the Cygnus X-1 system.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known galaxy.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  uncharted nebulae obscure their path, hostile alien encounters are a constant possibility, and the ship’s aging hyperdrive groans under the strain of interstellar travel.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, fuels her determination to press onward into the unfathomable depths of the cosmos.
