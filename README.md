
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of plague stalked the land as relentlessly as the shadows.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the sickness ravaging his homeland.  He carried with him only a chipped sword, a meager supply of dried meats, and the unwavering hope that fueled his weary legs.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and negotiating treacherous wormholes was routine, yet the vastness of space never ceased to inspire awe and a touch of fear.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human population, a desperate search across unimaginable distances for a new Eden.  Fuel reserves were low, communication with Earth was sporadic, and the alien landscapes they encountered held both wondrous beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Her crew's survival, and the future of humanity, rested on her navigation skills and her unwavering courage.
