
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a dozen kingdoms, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through a whispering forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and impending storm.  His quest – to deliver the King's ransom to the besieged Duke – was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and rumors of a monstrous beast guarding a vital mountain pass added to the growing unease. Each creak of saddle leather and rustle of leaves sharpened his senses, the thrill of the unknown a constant companion to the weariness of the journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace had been harrowing, the ship groaning under the strain of traversing unimaginable distances. Ahead lay the unknown dangers of an alien world, the potential for both incredible discovery and catastrophic failure. The vastness of space, a canvas painted with stars and cosmic dust, both inspired and humbled her in equal measure.
