
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and tear-stained corrections, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, promising both unimaginable riches and certain death.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine – the thrill of adventure intertwined inextricably with the chilling reality of her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the nebula of Xylos a swirling canvas outside her viewport.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the jump to the Andromeda galaxy was anything but.  Navigation through uncharted wormholes, evading pirate fleets lurking in the shadows of black holes, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies kept her senses razor-sharp.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril than the unforgiving terrain of medieval lands, but the siren call of exploration, the lure of the unknown, remained a constant, echoing through the ages.
