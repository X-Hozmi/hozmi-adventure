
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone city whispered to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  Yet, the lure of the Sunstone, and the whispered tales of its power, fueled their weary limbs and steeled their resolve for another day's hard travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigation charts were unreliable, and the ever-present threat of space pirates and unpredictable wormholes kept her crew on edge. But the potential rewards of discovering a gateway to countless new worlds overshadowed every danger, propelling them deeper into the uncharted cosmos.
