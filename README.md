
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the very landscape itself conspired against her solitary journey.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, each sunrise painting a new, perilous vista before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space presented dangers far beyond bandits and wild animals; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities tested the crew’s mettle.  But the promise of revolutionizing interstellar travel, of connecting civilizations light-years apart, fueled their relentless pursuit.
