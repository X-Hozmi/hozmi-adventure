
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, and the desperate hope for his people, fuel his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through a swirling nebula, her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, also holds untold dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms.  But Eva, driven by humanity's relentless thirst for discovery and the hope of finding a new home among the stars, navigates the cosmic expanse with unwavering determination, charting a course across the galaxies.
