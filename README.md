
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks piercing a sky bruised purple by the setting sun.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, entrusted with delivering a vital message to the distant king.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery as she ventured deeper into the unknown, a solitary figure against the vast, untamed landscape.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the familiar.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rourke piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards; the real danger lay in the uncharted territories beyond known space, where the very fabric of reality seemed to fray at the edges.  The cosmos held endless wonders, but also infinite threats for those brave – or foolish – enough to explore its vast expanse.
