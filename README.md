
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the battlefield he'd left behind. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague sweeping his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, menacing bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the vast, unknown distances and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic void, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance.  The galaxy was their battlefield, and the stars, their guide.
