
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume his party.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fuels their arduous journey, pushing them ever onward toward the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The vast expanse of space holds its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Navigating hyperspace, Eva relies on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to overcome the challenges, their journey a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of expansion into the uncharted cosmos.
