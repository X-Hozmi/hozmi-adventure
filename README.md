
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear clinging to the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the lingering shadows of the Black Death itself.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, kindness from unexpected strangers, and the unwavering hope that fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in lightyears.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were mere inconveniences compared to the loneliness of deep space and the ever-present threat of unknown, potentially hostile civilizations.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for forging new paths among the stars, propelled her forward, a descendant of countless adventurers who sought the unknown, regardless of era.
