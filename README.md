
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving terrain itself. Yet, the hope of healing spurred her on, her heart pounding a rhythm against the steady beat of the mule's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted galaxy of Andromeda.  The journey, years in the making, promised untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, but also the terrifying unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the effects of prolonged interstellar travel were just a few of the challenges she faced.  But the vastness of space, the glittering spectacle of distant worlds, fueled her determination to reach her goal and chart new territories for humankind.
