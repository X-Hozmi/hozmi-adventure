
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a chipped map, a waterskin, and the hope of finding her brother in the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for both danger and discovery – bandits, storms, or perhaps a serendipitous encounter with a wandering monk who held the key to her journey's success. The road stretched before her, a ribbon of uncertainty unwinding through the heart of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint whispers of nebulae and the unwavering guidance of her AI, Xylo, she charted a course towards the unmapped Kepler-186f system. The thrill of exploration pulsed through her veins, a stark contrast to the hum of the ship's engines.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, carrying the weight of discovery and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering catastrophic navigational errors, leaving her adrift in the unforgiving expanse of space.
