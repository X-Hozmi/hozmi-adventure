
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her journey from the fertile plains of Aquilonia to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, fueling her with a heady mix of fear and exhilaration as she pursued the whispered legends of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict research station orbiting Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue plasma bursts was a daily routine, far removed from the quaint dangers of Elara's era.  Yet, the thrill of exploration remained the same; the unknown beckoned with the same irresistible allure, promising scientific breakthroughs or catastrophic failure, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and daring across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
