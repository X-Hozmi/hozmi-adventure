Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the glint of gold on the horizon – a distant minaret – spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought new perils, but with each sunset, a deeper understanding of her own resilience blossomed.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only clue. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets became commonplace.  The vastness of space was a terrifying beauty, humbling in its scale, yet filled with the promise of discovery.  Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, every communication a fragile thread connecting her to the known universe. The thrill of exploration, however, outweighed the immense risk.
