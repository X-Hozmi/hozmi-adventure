
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Each creak of my pack spurred a fresh wave of anxiety –  my precious cargo, a shipment of silks destined for the Byzantine court, felt heavier than ever.  Wolves howled in the distance, a chilling counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of my mule’s bells.  Every bend in the path offered a fresh challenge, from cascading snowdrifts to the ever-present threat of bandits. Survival, not speed, was the measure of success.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the Andromeda galaxy.  The starfield outside, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns, was dwarfed only by the unimaginable scale of the journey. My mission:  to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a civilization technologically advanced beyond human comprehension. The potential rewards were immeasurable, but so were the risks – the K'tharr were notoriously unpredictable, and interstellar travel held inherent dangers.  The cosmos, vast and breathtaking, held both incredible promise and terrifying unknowns.
