
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the rough-spun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier on her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Rumors of its untold riches and powerful magic fuel her quest, though the dangers are real: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the lure of adventure, the chance to make her mark on the world, keeps her saddle sore legs moving forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that will take generations even with faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  malfunctioning engines, pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace are constant threats.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the lost colony and perhaps even find new, habitable worlds, is a beacon guiding her through the inky blackness.
