
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the dusty plains of France.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a whispered rumour of bandit hideouts, the looming shadow of a medieval castle, or the promise of a bustling market town offering respite and supplies.  The relentless sun beats down, yet the fear of the forest's edge, with its lurking wolves and shadowy figures, spurs us onward.  Every mile is a gamble, a test of resilience against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion.  Our starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaps across the void between galaxies, charting unmapped nebulae and encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes is all in a day's work. The vastness of space, both beautiful and deadly, offers a different kind of hardship compared to our medieval ancestors – the loneliness of the cosmos versus the dangers of the earth.  But the quest for new worlds and knowledge remains a powerful driving force, as it has always been.
