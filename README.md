Days bled into weeks as his small band traversed the treacherous landscape, facing bandits, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching the rumored city of Eldoria, a mythical place said to hold untold riches and power, a goal that fueled their perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of shimmering starscapes and the hum of the hyperdrive, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the constant vigilance needed to navigate asteroid fields and avoid rogue gravitational anomalies.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, as Eva pressed on, carrying humanity's hope for a new beginning across the galaxy.
