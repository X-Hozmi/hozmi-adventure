
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to overcome him. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the quest for the lost relic of Saint Lazarus, spurred him on. The whispers of its power fueled his relentless journey, making even the most arduous miles feel insignificant compared to the potential glory ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of star-strewn skies and the hum of the hyperdrive, a stark contrast to Kaelan's rough terrain.  Yet, the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted asteroid fields threatened to shatter her ship, while the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel presented a constant, thrilling risk.  The promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, propelled her forward, much like the ancient knight's yearning for glory.
