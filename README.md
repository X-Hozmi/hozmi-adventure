
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from smooth; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled unpredictably, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the whisper of distant cathedrals and the camaraderie of fellow travellers a balm to the harsh realities of the road.  This was a journey etched in sweat, fear, and the profound beauty of a world untamed.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  The vast, inky blackness held both wonder and peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to unravel the universe's greatest mysteries, fueled her crew's unwavering determination, making the risks – and the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders – all worthwhile.
