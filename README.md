
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to eternal life.  Days blurred into a relentless cycle of sun-baked trails, treacherous mountain passes, and tense nights spent huddled around dwindling embers, ever vigilant against bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the whispered legends and the gnawing hope of a discovery that would immortalize his name.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The vastness of space was a daunting, beautiful terror, the twinkling constellations offering little comfort against the potential dangers lurking in the void – rogue asteroids, hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Yet, the possibility of rediscovering lost humanity spurred her onward, a beacon in the cosmic dark.
