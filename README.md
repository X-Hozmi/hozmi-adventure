
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey ahead.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass, my only companions the ravens circling overhead and the gnawing fear of bandits lurking in the shadows.  A tattered map, clutched tightly in my hand, promised riches beyond the peaks – a lost city whispered of in hushed tones, a treasure to rival any king's hoard. The arduous climb was worth the risk, for adventure’s call sang louder than any warning.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts a swathe through the nebula, its engines a low hum against the silence of interstellar space.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a discovery that could rewrite the history of galactic exploration.  The risks are immense, but the potential reward – a universe unbound – is a siren song I cannot resist.
