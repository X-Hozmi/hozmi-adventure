
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a plea for aid from a besieged city.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse; wild wolves patrolled these heights, and rumors of monstrous creatures whispered on the wind.  Yet, the urgency of her mission fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of interstellar space.  Though the journey was fraught with the perils of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, the thrill of discovery, the potential to find new life, eclipsed any fear.  The vastness of space offered infinite adventure, a stark contrast to the confined world of medieval travel.
