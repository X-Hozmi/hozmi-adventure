
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Castile, her meager pack heavier with each passing mile.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs clings to the air, a welcome distraction from the gnawing hunger.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fuels her onward, the promise of solace at journey's end outweighing the hardships.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the vastness of space still holds dangers – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the isolated colony on Kepler-186f, a world clinging to survival on the fringes of explored space.  The journey is long, the challenges immense, but the knowledge that her cargo will sustain a struggling population keeps her focused on the shimmering constellations ahead.
