
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, her worn leather satchel holding little more than dried figs and a well-thumbed map.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and wonder. Bandits lurked in shadowy canyons, and the whispers of ancient ruins promised secrets older than kingdoms.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with hardship, but fueled by an unwavering desire for discovery and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting her bridge in ephemeral hues.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held dangers far different from Elara's – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events. Yet, the allure of charting unmapped galaxies and the possibility of finding life beyond Earth propelled Eva forward, a modern-day adventurer navigating a cosmos far grander than any medieval realm.
