
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, the desert tested her endurance with relentless heat and thirst, and the ever-present fear of the unknown gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the allure of the legendary city, promising untold riches and mysteries, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Nova' piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours painting the viewport.  His mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival on a dying Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, the risks of encountering hostile alien lifeforms or encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies ever-present.  But the vast unknown, with its promise of new worlds and potentially a new beginning, beckoned him onward, a siren song in the cold vacuum of space.
