
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each day brought new challenges, from bartering for meager meals in dusty villages to navigating by the stars under a vast, inky sky. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a thirst for adventure outweighing the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies for the Galactic Federation.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its unpredictability, held a different kind of peril.  Wormholes, asteroid fields, and rogue space pirates posed constant threats.  But for Ryla, the risk was a small price to pay for the awe-inspiring discoveries that awaited – new planets, alien civilizations, and the boundless mysteries of the cosmos.
