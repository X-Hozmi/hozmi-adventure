
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a map, a half-eaten loaf, and the hope of reaching the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, a pilgrimage driven by a desperate need to save her ailing brother. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat, sharpening her senses and fueling her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding not with fear, but with the thrill of discovery.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigation was a delicate dance between gravitational pulls and unpredictable asteroid fields, a stark contrast to the relatively straightforward, though still dangerous, land routes of the medieval era.  Yet, the universal human spirit of adventure remained, burning brightly in the hearts of both Elara and Eva, propelled by the allure of the unknown.
