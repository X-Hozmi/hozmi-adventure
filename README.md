
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, sharpened her senses.  Bandits were a constant threat, and the whispered rumours of a monstrous beast haunting the mountain passes fueled her unease. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, its silks and spices a siren's call, pushed her onward.  The journey was a constant test of endurance, a dance with the elements and the unpredictable nature of man.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony a light-year from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold, glittering beauty of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperdrive malfunctions, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  Yet, the promise of new worlds, new life, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.  The universe was her canvas, and exploration her brush.
