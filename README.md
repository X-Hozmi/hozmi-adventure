
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the jagged peaks a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry woven by the wildflowers clinging precariously to the cliff faces.  Her worn map, a testament to countless revisions and tear-stained corrections, guided her towards the mythical Sunken City of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril – brigands lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast unknown that lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted across a thousand light years towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders – swirling gas giants, ethereal planetary rings, and the distant, glittering pinpricks of uncharted star systems.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, a gamble against the vast emptiness of space and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The journey was long, the stakes impossibly high, but the lure of discovery burned bright within her heart.
