
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the towering mountains, and the endless expanse of desert threatened to swallow him whole. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, hostile nomads, and the ever-present fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled him forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, held both awe and peril.  Navigation glitches threatened to send them hurtling into a black hole, while unknown alien life forms – some friendly, some decidedly not – lurked just beyond the sensors.  Yet, the boundless potential of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her every action.
