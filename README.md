
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Andalusian plains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried figs and a worn map; it contains the seeds of rebellion, entrusted to her by a clandestine network fighting against the oppressive King.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightens the thrill –  a constant reminder of the perilous journey and the potentially fatal consequences of failure.  She pressed on, fueled by the hope of a brighter future for her people.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted across her viewport were breathtaking, but the mission was anything but scenic.  A distress signal from a remote colony on Kepler-186f had initiated a frantic race against time, requiring a daring hyperspace jump through uncharted territory. The potential dangers of alien life and unknown gravitational forces were a small price to pay for the chance to save countless lives light years away.
