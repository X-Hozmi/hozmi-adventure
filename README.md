
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, a mere ribbon of dust winding through the unforgiving highlands, stretched before him, promising both peril and untold riches.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic and unimaginable treasures, fueled his journey.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in his quest for glory and fortune. Each creak of his saddle, each beat of his horse's hooves, echoed the relentless rhythm of his adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant stars and the occasional rogue asteroid, held far greater dangers than any medieval knight could imagine.  Warp drives, sophisticated navigation systems, and a crew of hardened spacefarers were her only allies against the uncaring immensity of the cosmos. The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed every risk.
