
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her perilous journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the blight ravaging their crops.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse,  but the thought of her people spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth. Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true peril lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  The vast, inky blackness was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of her fragile position amidst the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.  The fate of billions rested on her shoulders, a burden heavier than any physical weight.
