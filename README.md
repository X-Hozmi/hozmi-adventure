
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and water skins; it contained the hope of finding her estranged brother, lost somewhere in the sprawling, bandit-ridden wilderness. Every creaking wagon wheel, every rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine – the journey was fraught with peril, but the fierce loyalty burning in her heart fueled her onward.  Each sunset brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at warp speed.  The vast emptiness between stars held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of hyperspace.  But Jaxx, driven by a sense of duty and the hope of finding survivors, pressed on, guided only by the faintest signal from a long-lost beacon.
