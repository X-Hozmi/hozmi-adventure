
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and the tattered map promising riches in the fabled city of Zerzura. Bandits, scorching deserts, and unpredictable weather were constant companions on her arduous journey; each sunrise brought a fresh test of her courage and resilience, each sunset the bittersweet solace of a hard-won campsite under a canopy of stars.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on unsuspecting explorers venturing into the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
