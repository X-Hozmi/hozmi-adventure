
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold healing powers for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous terrain threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, with each arduous mile, the unwavering hope for her brother's recovery fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the Althea shuddering as it jumped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from a newly discovered planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar plague immunity.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and the ever-present threat of wormholes were all commonplace hazards.  But the potential to save countless lives spurred Rexx and his crew through the dangers of the cosmos, their journey a high-stakes gamble across the uncharted expanse of space.
