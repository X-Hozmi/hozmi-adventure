
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through dense forests and over treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, navigating by the stars in the absence of proper maps.  His quest – to reach the legendary city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone – demanded unwavering resolve, a courage forged in the fires of countless hardships encountered across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth. Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, punctuated by the occasional warp-jump through space-time itself.  The thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new life, fuelled her unwavering spirit as she pushed the boundaries of known space, a modern-day adventurer charting a course across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
