The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering crags clawed at the bruised purple sky, while bandits, rumored to be as savage as the wolves that howled at night, lurked in the shadowed forests.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.
