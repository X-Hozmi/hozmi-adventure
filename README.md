
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in stolen jewels, the price of her freedom from a forced marriage.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse—the king's men.  The breathtaking alpine vistas offered little comfort against the constant threat of danger; survival was a daily, brutal adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the colossal cosmic tapestry. The mission: retrieving a rare mineral from the gas giant Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, but the potential reward – enough energy to power a fledgling colony – outweighed the perils.  Jax, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, knew the vastness of space held wonders beyond imagination, but also the cold, uncaring reality of a universe that could extinguish life in an instant.
