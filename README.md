
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a victory against the biting wind whipping across the desolate plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a daunting but necessary passage to reach the fabled Silk Road.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving elements and the even more unforgiving human nature that thrived in these wild lands. The promise of untold riches and exotic spices fueled my relentless westward trek.

Millennia later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting lullaby against the infinite blackness of intergalactic space.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The journey, however, was far from tranquil.  Pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony were a constant threat, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes necessitated constant course corrections.  Each jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the crushing void, yet the allure of scientific breakthrough outweighed any personal risk.  The galaxy was a vast, terrifying, and ultimately irresistible frontier.
