
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the gnawing fear in his gut.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart a steady beat against the hum of the hyperdrive.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth, was fraught with its own dangers: unpredictable wormholes, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  But unlike the medieval knights of old, Eva had technology on her side, sophisticated sensors and powerful weaponry.  Still, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes, and the gamble of finding a new home for humanity fueled her spirit, a modern adventurer charting the unknown expanse of the cosmos.
