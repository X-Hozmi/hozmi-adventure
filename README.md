
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the endless expanse of desert threatened to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance, fueling her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unimaginable distances.  Warp jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the constant threat of system failures kept her crew on edge. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering new life and forging a new future, propelled them ever onward.
