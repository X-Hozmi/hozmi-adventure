
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud and ice, and the constant threat of starvation were daily realities.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager rations in dusty villages, and always, the gnawing uncertainty of their destination.  But the lure of the sacred city, the promise of spiritual redemption, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora and fauna of unimaginable beauty and danger.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony was a test of skill and courage.  The vastness of space, both wondrous and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval adventures, yet the human spirit's thirst for exploration remained the same – a burning need to push boundaries and discover the unknown.
