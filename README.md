
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant battle.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the hope of salvation spurred him onwards, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining minerals to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps tossed the ship like a leaf in a hurricane, while the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through her bones.  The vast, indifferent expanse of space held both wonder and peril; asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each leg of the journey a gamble.  Yet, the knowledge that her cargo could mean the difference between life and death for a whole planet fueled her determination.
