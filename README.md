
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the sun-baked track.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of charting her own course across the unmapped wilderness, fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope and determination, a reminder that the greatest adventures were born from the courage to venture beyond the familiar.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human population.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, and communicating with alien civilizations were daily occurrences.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, the vastness of space presented a different kind of fear – the lonely isolation of being a tiny speck in a cosmic ocean.  Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, and charting a future for humanity propelled her forward, her courage echoing that of the medieval traveler centuries before.
