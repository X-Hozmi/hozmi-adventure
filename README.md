
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a stark silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, more faded prayer than guide, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each day was a gamble – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the allure of unlocking the secrets of the universe, of charting a course to galaxies beyond imagining, burned brighter than any star.
