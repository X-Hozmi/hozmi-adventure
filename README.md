
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's chainmail as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the whispered legends of Eldoria, and the desperate hope for his people, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving terrain.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crippling loneliness of interstellar travel were everyday occurrences.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held both the promise of scientific breakthrough and the constant threat of oblivion, a risk she willingly accepted for the sake of humanity’s future.
