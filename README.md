
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous bogs swallowing whole wagons, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, with its whispered treasures and ancient magic, spurred him on. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a testament to the unpredictable and thrilling nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less fraught with danger.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life forms kept her crew on edge.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, offered a different kind of adventure, a grand scale exploration that dwarfed even the most ambitious medieval quest.
