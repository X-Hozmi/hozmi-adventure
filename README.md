
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, sharpens her senses.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of the plague ride on the wind.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril, but promising untold riches and the cure for her ailing brother.  Every sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Thorne pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Warp drives hum, sensors scan for pirate vessels and unforeseen gravitational anomalies.  The vastness of space holds wonders beyond imagination, but also dangers far more lethal than any medieval bandit.  The weight of her crew's survival, the future of humankind, rests on her shoulders as she navigates the perilous cosmic currents towards a new beginning.
