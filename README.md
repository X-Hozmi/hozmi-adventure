
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the caravan as it lumbered across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves a counterpoint to the creaking of laden wagons.  Sir Reginald, his visor raised against the oppressive heat, scanned the horizon, his hand never far from the pommel of his sword.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts, fueled their perilous journey.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, testing the mettle of every traveler in this grand, uncertain quest.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colors painting the viewport.  Their mission: to reach the Xylos system, a rumored haven of advanced technology hidden at the edge of explored space.  The dangers weren't bandits and bandits, but rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable riches or utter annihilation.
