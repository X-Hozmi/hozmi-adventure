
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Each day was a gamble – the threat of bandits, starvation, or disease loomed larger than any dragon in a fireside tale. Yet, the whispered rumors of a hidden monastery, holding the key to her family's lost legacy, fueled her onward.  The journey was brutal, but the promise of discovery outweighed every hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation through uncharted star systems was perilous, the constant threat of asteroid fields and unknown gravitational forces a constant companion. Yet, the allure of the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold artifacts from a long-lost galactic civilization, drove her crew forward. Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime itself. But the potential rewards, the chance to uncover the universe's greatest secrets, made the risks worthwhile.
