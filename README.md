
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the relentless journey across the vast expanse of the Holy Roman Empire.  The biting wind whipped across the plains, stinging my face as I navigated by the crooked finger of the setting sun.  Rumors of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and guarded by ancient magic, fueled my perilous trek.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at my resolve, yet the allure of the unknown propelled me forward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against fate.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Orion’s belt, a familiar constellation from my childhood, shrunk to a distant pinprick as we jumped into the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  My mission: to locate a lost colony, their last transmission a frantic plea for assistance, swallowed by the cosmic silence.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold, indifferent glow of stars, dwarfed my insignificance, but the urgency of the mission, the hope of rescue, spurred me onward towards the unknown.
