
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of my mare as we crested the ridge, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before us like a rumpled green tapestry.  My worn leather satchel held little besides a few dried apricots, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than my hopes.  Ahead lay Avignon, a whispered promise of trade and perhaps, a chance to escape the shadow of the Black Death that clung to our village like a shroud.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – or disaster.  Banditry, famine, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on this perilous journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the star-strewn void.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was measured not in days or weeks, but in years, punctuated by the routine maintenance of the ship and the ever-present tension of navigating asteroid fields and encountering rogue subspace currents. While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, engine failure, alien encounters – the thrill of discovery, the pushing of boundaries, mirrored that ancient yearning for the unknown that drove my medieval ancestor across those dusty plains.
