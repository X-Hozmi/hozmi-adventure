
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched Breton countryside. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had become a desperate race against both dwindling supplies and the whispers of bandit raids that echoed through the sun-baked valleys. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers to ford, and the constant threat of starvation and disease. Yet, in the shared hardship and the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape, they found a fierce camaraderie, their adventure a tapestry woven from peril and breathtaking vistas.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and awe-inspiring, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders – swirling gas giants, glittering star clusters, and the silent, watchful expanse of the void.  Facing the perils of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities, the crew of the *Starseeker* pressed onward, driven by hope and the indomitable spirit of exploration.
