
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead, the rumored lost city of Eldoria beckoned, a prize whispered about in smoky taverns and crackling campfires.  His journey had already taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains swarming with bandits, and through dark forests where the shadows seemed to hold their breath.  Each day brought new challenges, from dwindling supplies to encounters with the unpredictable whims of nature, but the lure of Eldoria, and the glory it promised, kept his spirit strong.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable quantum fluctuations of hyperspace were all part of a typical day. The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, dwarfed even the grandest medieval adventure, yet the thrill of discovery and the potential for groundbreaking success burned as brightly within her as it had in Thomas's heart.
