
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their battered cart, laden with supplies barely sufficient for the arduous journey ahead, creaked a mournful song.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and rivers swollen with spring rains.  Survival depended on their wits, their courage, and the unwavering loyalty that bound them together.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and untold dangers.  Cosmic storms raged, threatening to tear her ship apart, and derelict spacecraft, silent monuments to past expeditions, served as grim reminders of the perils of interstellar travel. Yet, Eva, driven by a deep sense of duty and the hope of finding survivors, pressed onward, navigating the vast emptiness with the skill and determination of a true pioneer.
