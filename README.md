
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a potent healing balm for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves. The journey was fraught with peril, yet the hope of salvation spurred him on, his spirit as resilient as the ancient stones that lined his path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across a fractured system after a catastrophic solar flare.  Warp jumps were risky, hyperspace treacherous, and the constant threat of pirate raids added to the tension.  Each star cluster held both the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of oblivion.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, held fast to her course, guided by a dwindling signal and the unwavering hope of finding survivors.
