
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical City of Whispers, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the relentless sun threatened dehydration, but the lure of untold riches and forgotten magic spurred her onward, each creak of her saddle a testament to her unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored haven for advanced technology lost to time.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr Empire, whose warships were as numerous as the stars, was a constant battle of wits and skill.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but also unforgiving dangers; for Rexx, the allure of discovery was a siren's call he couldn't resist.
