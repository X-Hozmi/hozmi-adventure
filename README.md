
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the next hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, felt less heroic and more like a grueling endurance test.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of distant spires spurred him onward, the promise of reaching his destination fueling his aching muscles and determined spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vastness of space remained a daunting and unpredictable landscape.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, unknown celestial bodies lurked in the darkness, and the loneliness of deep space weighed heavily on the crew. But the faint signal from the lost colony, a flicker of hope in the cosmic abyss, pushed them ever closer to their destination, testing their courage and skill to the very limits.
