
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest had been brutal; bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of wild animals had tested his mettle and his supplies.  But the whispered rumors of a lost city, filled with forgotten magic and untold riches, spurred him on.  Each creak of the saddle, each splash through a muddy stream, was a step closer to the adventure, the glory, the legend he sought.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through a nebula of iridescent hues.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey across the vast gulf between galaxies was a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional crackle of the comms system.  But the potential rewards – unlocking the secrets of the universe – were worth the risks, the isolation, the years spent hurtling through the inky blackness of space.
