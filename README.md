
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Andalusia.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising the legendary lost city of Zerzura.  Bandits, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies test her resolve daily, but the whisper of ancient secrets fuels her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each startled hawk, marks another step closer to the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the rumored Xylan artifact, a device said to bridge galaxies.  Asteroids whiz past, their trajectories predicted but never fully controlled.  The constant hum of the warp drive is a familiar lullaby, but the unknown dangers lurking in unexplored space – rogue planets, hostile alien species, and the insidious void itself – are ever-present, making each jump to hyperspace a thrilling gamble for survival and discovery.
