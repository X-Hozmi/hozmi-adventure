
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she bumped across the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and horse sweat thick in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, felt less like a pilgrimage and more a desperate gamble.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas swirling around his starship like a cosmic storm.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of spacetime made each jump a calculated risk.  Alien encounters were frequent – some friendly, others less so – and the constant hum of the warp drive was a relentless reminder of the vast, unforgiving expanse of space separating him from his destination and the uncertain fate of the colonists.
