
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his weary steed onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of the Holy Land, a stark contrast to the lush green meadows he’d left behind months ago.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his horse, was a testament to the arduous journey – a perilous pilgrimage through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and through sun-baked deserts, all in pursuit of the legendary lost city of Zerzura.  The whispers of its untold riches fueled his weary legs, pushing him forward into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula of incandescent gas, the swirling colours a vibrant backdrop to the vast, inky blackness of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting roar against the terrifying silence of the cosmos.  Each jump through hyperspace, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances, was fraught with danger – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of uncharted star systems.  The future, it seemed, was just as perilous as the past.
