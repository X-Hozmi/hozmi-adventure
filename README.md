
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village is a faint promise, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic, is fraught with peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering hope for salvation fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Vast nebulae paint the void in breathtaking hues, while the hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors and search for habitable planets.  The dangers are different here – treacherous asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien civilizations. Yet, the allure of discovery and the thrill of charting the uncharted burn brighter than any star.
