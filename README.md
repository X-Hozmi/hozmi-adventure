
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the muddy track barely visible beneath a relentless downpour.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promised both shelter and peril.  We carried with us a tattered map, whispered rumors of a hidden monastery and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the constant threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of fortune and glory, spurred us onward.


Millennia later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The Althea, a vessel forged from light and ambition, cut a shimmering path through the nebula, its destination a planet whispered to hold the key to galactic peace.  Our crew, a diverse tapestry of species from across the cosmos, faced dangers far grander than any medieval knight:  warp storms that threatened to tear our ship apart, hostile alien leviathans, and the chilling emptiness of space itself.  But the potential reward – a future free from the tyrannical grip of the Kryll empire – outweighed every terrifying risk.
