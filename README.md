
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World was far from over; bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked her every step.  But the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, with its rumored treasures and forgotten magic, fueled her weary bones. Each creaking wagon wheel, each thunderclap in the distance, was a challenge met with grim determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, was risky, traversing uncharted space teeming with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and pirate fleets.  But the promise of a new home, a fresh start for humanity amongst the stars, outweighed the peril.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent darkness of space, as she steered her ship towards a future brimming with both hope and uncertainty.
