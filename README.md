
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of knights pressed onward, their cloaked figures silhouetted against the bruised purple of the setting sun.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their horses' hooves pounding a rhythm against the unforgiving earth.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years away, was fraught with risk.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day’s work for a seasoned explorer like Eva. But the promise of discovering new life, of charting unmapped territories across the vast cosmos, fueled her unwavering determination, a modern-day knight errant in the star-strewn expanse.
