
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed on, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with perilous fords, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the burning hope of Eldoria fueled their weary limbs, pushing them further into the unknown wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the expanding nebula decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva relied on her trusty crew and cutting-edge technology to survive. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, but the promise of finding life amidst the stars drove them onward, towards the unknown corners of the galaxy.
