
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Her worn map, a patchwork of hastily drawn sketches and faded script, is her only guide as she journeys to the fabled city of Prague, seeking a cure for her ailing brother.  The journey is fraught with peril; icy rivers to ford, hostile lords to appease, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Prague's healing arts fuel her onward, a beacon in the harsh medieval night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey that will take generations.  Unlike the medieval travelers relying on brute strength and chance, Eva commands technology capable of warping spacetime. Yet, the vastness of space presents its own dangers – unpredictable stellar anomalies, pirate attacks, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  The weight of her responsibility, to deliver her crew and their precious cargo of knowledge safely to their destination, is a burden as heavy as any medieval packhorse.
