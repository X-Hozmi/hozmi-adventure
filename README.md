The muddy track, barely a path, wound through a forest haunted by whispers of goblins and the ever-present threat of bandits.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.

The future of interstellar travel hung in the balance, and Eva, alone in the vast darkness, held the key.
