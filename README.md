
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the journey, but the lure of Eldoria, and the glory that discovering it promised, spurred him on through the unforgiving landscape of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage fraught with the perils of unmapped cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone explorers.  While the technology was vastly different, the spirit of adventure remained the same – a relentless drive to explore the unknown, fueled by a thirst for discovery and the promise of unimaginable wonders lying beyond the farthest reaches of known space.
