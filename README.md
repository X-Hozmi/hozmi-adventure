
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she spurred her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey wasn't one of pilgrimage or conquest, but a desperate flight from a vengeful baron.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, the vastness of the land both a refuge and a terrifying reminder of her vulnerability.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous trek towards the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Malo.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, seeking a legendary source of energy that could save her dying homeworld.  Warp jumps were risky, the unknown dangers of alien space a constant threat, but the thought of her people spurred her on.  The vast cosmic expanse, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and nebulas, offered both awe-inspiring beauty and the chilling silence of the unknown, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her challenge.
