
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, urged his weary steed onward.  The King's summons, a frantic plea for aid against a rebel lord, had driven him across treacherous mountain passes and through forests teeming with brigands. Each sunrise brought the chilling promise of new dangers – starvation, disease, or the cold steel of an enemy blade.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of his small band of loyal men, and the noble purpose of his quest fueled his onward journey.  He was a knight errant, and his path was paved with adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been fraught with peril; a near-miss with a rogue asteroid field had shaken the ship to its core. Now, facing the shimmering gas giant that dominated the Kepler system, she prepared for the final approach to the planet, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vastness of space held a constant, exhilarating threat, but for Elara, the promise of discovery far outweighed the risks.  The galaxy was her playground, and adventure her constant companion.
