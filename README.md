
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights crested the hill, the harsh sun beating down on their worn leather armor.  Before them lay the vast, untamed wilderness separating them from the Sultan's promised riches – a journey fraught with peril.  Whispers of bandits, mythical beasts, and treacherous terrain filled their weary minds, yet the lure of gold and glory spurred them onward, each step a gamble against the unknown.  Their horses' hooves pounded a rhythm of hope and fear against the unforgiving earth.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, the kaleidoscopic colors a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to reach the Xylos system, a rumored haven of rare minerals crucial to humanity's survival.  Warp jumps were risky, the possibility of spatial anomalies a constant threat, but the future of her people depended on her success.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a stark reminder of the incredible distances and unimaginable dangers she faced.
