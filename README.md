
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each whispered prayer to the Virgin Mary, marked another step away from the familiar and deeper into the unknown.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, dark wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing critical systems were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, tested her courage and skill.  But the thought of aiding those far from home, a human beacon in the galactic dark, spurred her onward.
