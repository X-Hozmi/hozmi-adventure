
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous rivers snaked across her path, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura’s shimmering spires and untold riches spurred her onward, a beacon in the harsh landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking but treacherous backdrop to their interstellar voyage.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The jump to hyperspace was a jarring transition, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Ahead lay the challenges of alien environments, potential hostile encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any rescue.  But the potential discovery of a new home, a chance for survival, fuelled their tireless quest across the vast expanse of space.
