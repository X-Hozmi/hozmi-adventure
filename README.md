
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, her worn leather jerkin shielding her from the relentless sun.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, sharpened her senses.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death were as real as the parched earth beneath her feet.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Samarkand for a cure for her ailing brother – felt as vast and uncertain as the horizon itself.  Every sunrise brought new dangers and a fragile hope that fuelled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, far from the dusty plains of old, took her across light years and past alien worlds bathed in the crimson glow of dying suns.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – but the thrill of exploration burned just as brightly.  The cosmos, a boundless ocean of stars, beckoned, promising untold wonders and the potential for both discovery and destruction in equal measure.
