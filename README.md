
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and sweating horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each day brings its own peril: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, sudden sandstorms that threaten to bury us alive, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura’s unimaginable riches and legendary artifacts fuel our relentless journey, pushing us onward despite the hardships. The desert sun beats down, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving landscape we must conquer.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Starseeker*, a sleek starship forged from alloys unknown to medieval man, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable world light-years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with dangers of its own - asteroid fields that threaten to pulverize us, temporal anomalies that could tear our ship apart, and the ever-present threat of the unknown lurking in the inky blackness between stars. Yet, the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, outweighs the risks, driving us toward the furthest reaches of unexplored space.
