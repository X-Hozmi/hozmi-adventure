
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest, to reach the rumored lost monastery of Saint Fiacre, was a perilous one.  Bandit raids were commonplace, and the whispers of monstrous creatures lurking in the shadowed forests fueled her every step.  Each creaking wagon wheel and distant wolf howl was a reminder of the unforgiving wilderness she traversed, a constant test of her courage and resilience.  The monastery, if it existed, held the key to her family's future, a gamble worth the risk of death itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula were all in a day's work for Nova and her crew.  The journey itself was as hazardous as the mission’s objective, a relentless test of skill and technology in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
