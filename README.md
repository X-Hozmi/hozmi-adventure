
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the breathtaking beauty of untamed landscapes. Each sunrise brought the chilling uncertainty of what dangers the next valley held, a stark contrast to the shimmering promise of his destination.  He traveled alongside a grizzled veteran, a wizened scholar, and a surprisingly resourceful thief, their unlikely fellowship forged in the crucible of shared hardship and a mutual thirst for adventure.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational tides and asteroid fields, while the ship's AI, a wry and sarcastic program named HAL-E, provided a steady stream of both helpful advice and sarcastic commentary.  The journey was less about the physical peril of bandits and more about the unrelenting pressure of interstellar travel – the loneliness of deep space, the constant threat of system failures, and the sheer scale of the universe itself, pressing in on the tiny vessel and its determined crew.
