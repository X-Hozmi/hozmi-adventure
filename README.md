
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new landscape – treacherous mountain passes, dense forests teeming with unseen dangers, and sun-baked deserts where mirages mocked their thirst.  Each mile brought them closer to their goal, but also closer to the edge of despair, their journey a brutal test of endurance and unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across a dozen planets after a catastrophic warp-jump failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of pulsars, Elara relied on her crew's skill and the ship's aging technology.  The vastness of space was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly lonely, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos, their hope a fragile spark in the infinite darkness.
