
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already tested their mettle.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of a relentless landscape had chipped away at their supplies and resolve. Yet, the whispers of Eldoria’s fabled healing waters and ancient knowledge spurred them onwards, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness.  The clang of their armour was a lonely counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, the vast emptiness of space both beautiful and terrifying.  The faint, blue light of Kepler-186f in the distance was a beacon of hope, promising both discovery and the potential for unimaginable peril.
