
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their mission: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a lost relic of immense power.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the glory awaiting the knight who found it, spurred them onward, their determination fueled by whispered legends and the glint of distant, uncertain horizons.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant cosmic tapestry of gas and stardust.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the potential for discovering new life, new technologies, and charting unmapped territories surpassed any risk.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, was a constant companion on her perilous journey to the unknown.
