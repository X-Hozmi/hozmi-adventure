The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, swallowed the sound of their hooves.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Saint Brigid, a journey fraught with peril and uncertainty, but one he would undertake for glory and the salvation of his kingdom.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a constant companion on this perilous pilgrimage across the land.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions but shrouded in mystery.  Navigation charts flickered across her holographic display, charting a course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, while her crew monitored subspace communications for any sign of alien life, friendly or hostile.  The vast emptiness of space offered its own brand of terror, the immensity of the cosmos a stark contrast to the tight confines of her ship, the potential for disaster as limitless as the galaxy itself.
