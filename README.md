
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the air.  Her journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and whispers of a plague sweeping across the land fueled her urgency.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage, pushing her closer to her goal, a goal that may or may not exist when she finally arrives.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace on her long-haul cargo runs.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and unimaginable wonders, held both awe and terror.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with alien encounters – both friendly and hostile – adding spice to her already thrilling career.
