
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurked in every shadowed forest, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim their lives, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and endurance, a chance to discover hidden valleys, ancient ruins, and the kindness – or cruelty – of strangers. Their quest, shrouded in myth and legend, held the promise of unimaginable riches, but the path was paved with hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known universes, sought the legendary Xylos Nebula, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present dangers of interstellar radiation were just part of the routine.  Each jump to hyperspace held the possibility of discovery – new planets, alien civilizations, and untold wonders – but also the terrifying reality of encountering unknown threats in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
