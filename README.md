
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of the distant city of Aethelburg shimmering like a mirage in the midday heat.  Her journey from the northern marches has been arduous, fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a fresh challenge, a test of her resilience and resourcefulness, but the promise of reaching Aethelburg – and finally finding her estranged brother – fuels her onward.  The road ahead remains uncertain, but the spirit of adventure burns bright within her.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the newly colonized planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both wonder and danger.  Warp jumps across vast interstellar distances are commonplace, but each one holds a risk of spatial anomaly or pirate attack.  The crew of the *Stardust Drifter* faces challenges far removed from medieval hardships – technological failures, alien life forms, and the weight of their own mortality in the unforgiving expanse of space – but the allure of exploration, of discovering the unknown, binds them together in their shared quest.
