
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the Black Forest, a tapestry of ancient oaks and shadows.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen reliquary of Saint Eadmund – led him through bandit-infested passes, across swollen rivers on precarious bridges, and into the chilling embrace of forgotten ruins whispering tales of forgotten kings. Each day brought new peril, from the relentless pursuit of rival knights to the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the allure of adventure and the weight of his sacred duty pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant, swirling colours of gas giants and the glittering dust of a thousand dying stars were a breathtaking backdrop to her mission:  to locate the lost colony of Xylos Prime.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with risk, the unpredictable gravitational forces of uncharted systems a constant threat.  But the lure of discovery, of uncovering the fate of her ancestors, fueled her journey across the vast expanse of the cosmos.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, yet the potential reward – the rediscovery of a lost civilization – was worth the extraordinary risks.
