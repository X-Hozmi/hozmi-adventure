
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, whispered on the wind, propelled him forward, a tiny knight against a vast and dangerous world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish first contact with the Xylan civilization, a feat that could reshape interstellar relations.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were mere inconveniences compared to the political tensions simmering back on Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, yet the human spirit, its thirst for discovery undiminished by time or distance, remained the same.
