
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just meager rations; it contains the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a vengeful baron.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of starvation are constant companions on her perilous journey to the distant coast.  The promise of a sea passage to a new land fuels her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of her uncertain future.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a gamble that could secure the future of his people.  The jump drives hum with barely contained energy, each hyperspace leap a perilous dance with gravity and the unknown.  Asteroids threaten to tear through his hull, while the relentless void presses in, a silent testament to the vastness and danger of interstellar travel.  Yet, the possibility of finding his lost kin, of uncovering the secrets of Xylos, fuels his journey across the uncharted expanse of space.
