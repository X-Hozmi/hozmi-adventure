
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara's small caravan lumbered onward.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, the unforgiving terrain tested their supplies daily, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a fresh test of their courage and resilience as they pressed ever closer to their elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rendar piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a swirling nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of his cockpit. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets, Rexx and his crew faced not only the vast emptiness of space, but also the unknown dangers of alien life and the ever-present risk of their ship succumbing to the rigors of interstellar travel.  The search for Xylos was a voyage into the uncharted territories of the cosmos, a gamble with their lives and their future.
