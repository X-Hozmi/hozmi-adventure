
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a worn map, promising a shortcut to Constantinople, a shortcut whispered in taverns and fraught with peril.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the allure of the fabled city, a jewel of the Eastern Empire, fueled her onward. The rhythmic clop of hooves was a counterpoint to the anxious beat of her heart; every bend in the path held the potential for adventure, or its bitter twin, disaster.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Cygnus X-1.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both wonder and danger – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  But the promise of discovery, of finding life beyond Earth, ignited a fire in her soul, eclipsing the solitude and risks inherent in galactic travel.  The hum of the warp drive was her lullaby, the cosmos her endless, thrilling road.
