
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tightly.  The whispers of bandits and the rumors of a hidden monastery fueled her journey, a pilgrimage as much for spiritual solace as for the legendary healing herbs said to grow within its walls. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers and rewards that lay ahead on this perilous medieval trek.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the infinite backdrop of the cosmos.  The mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates, Eva faced dangers far removed from the medieval world, yet the spirit of adventure – the relentless pursuit of the unknown and the unwavering courage to face the vastness of the universe – remained the same.
