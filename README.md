
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the rugged terrain.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened landslides, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical city of Ys, its streets paved with gold and its temples shimmering with celestial light, fueled her onward, a beacon in the gathering dusk.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, new landscapes, and the tantalizing hope of discovering a legend.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all in a day's work for Comet. The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the lure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, propelled him onward, a lone explorer in a sea of stars.
