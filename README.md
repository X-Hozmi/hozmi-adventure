
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of facing adversity, fueled her onward.  The whispered legends of miracles and the camaraderie of fellow travelers sustained her spirit against the harsh realities of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered sector of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Eva faced the void's silent threats - rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien civilizations.  But the vastness of space, the sheer immensity of the cosmos, was a siren song, a call to explore that echoed across millennia, linking her quest with Elara's centuries before.
