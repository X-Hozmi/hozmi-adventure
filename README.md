
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the muddy track. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the whispered promises of Eldoria, and the desperate hope in their hearts, fueled their weary steps across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer,' her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, scattered across a dozen planets, each with its own unique dangers and wonders.  Navigating nebulae and asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids and navigating complex alien politics, Eva's journey was a testament to human courage, pushing the boundaries of space and time in a relentless pursuit of connection amidst the breathtaking, and often terrifying, vastness of the cosmos.
