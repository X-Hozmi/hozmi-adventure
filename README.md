
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile scroll containing her family's secret, a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold untold knowledge.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover a lost legacy, fueled her onward, the rough terrain mirroring the unpredictable path of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jorasco piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship swallowed by the treacherous gravitational currents years ago.  The vastness of space, the eerie silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines, instilled a profound sense of isolation, but the hope of finding survivors, perhaps even uncovering a new, unexplored planet, outweighed the fear. The galaxy held infinite possibilities, both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unpredictable heart of adventure.
