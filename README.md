
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom – a priceless jeweled reliquary – entrusted to him for delivery to a distant monastery.  His journey had already claimed a mule, two companions to bandits, and countless blisters, but the promise of reward, and the thrill of traversing the untamed wilds of Europe, kept his spirit ablaze.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding wolves, and the ever-present threat of human treachery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially dangerous lifeforms.   Warp drive hummed, a comforting vibration against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  The galaxy was her oyster, a limitless expanse of adventure tempered by the cold, hard reality of interstellar travel and the ever-present danger of unpredictable celestial phenomena and hostile alien encounters.
