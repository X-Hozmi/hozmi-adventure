
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence a fiery orange.  Her leather-bound map, stained with sweat and rain, guided her through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked plains.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any mapped landmark.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine, tested her spirit as much as her endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the volatile K'tharr system.  The vastness of space held a different kind of threat – the unknown, the unseen dangers lurking in the cosmic dark.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding new life, propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the unimaginable.
