
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise painting the sky in hues of hope, Elara pressed on, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones she passed.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Xylan civilization on the distant planet Kepler-186f.  The journey, a year-long odyssey through uncharted space, held its own perils – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. But the allure of first contact, the chance to expand human understanding and break new ground, fuelled Rexa’s unwavering determination, driving her forward into the vast, glittering unknown.
