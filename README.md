
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear thick in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague-ridden villages sent shivers down her spine.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the promise of Zerzura, of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly-discovered planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space-faring Kryll, Eva relied on her instincts and cutting-edge technology.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless unknowns. But the potential rewards – unlocking interstellar trade and securing humanity's future – outweighed the risk, pushing Eva and her crew further into the uncharted depths of the galaxy.
