
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled behind him, a pale brown ribbon unwinding through the sun-baked landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it offered, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate fleets were just part of the routine. The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the familiar Earth, held its own unique dangers – cosmic storms, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  But the hope of finding survivors, and perhaps uncovering the secrets of the wormhole itself, drove her onward.
