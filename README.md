
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her mule laden with meager supplies.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Alexandria and deliver a vital message to the Sultan, is a perilous undertaking, demanding courage, resourcefulness, and a stubborn refusal to yield to despair.  The unpredictable landscape, and the even more unpredictable people she encounters, are far more daunting than any map could ever depict.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the Andromeda galaxy, the swirling nebulae a breathtaking, yet dangerous, backdrop.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with hostile alien civilizations are commonplace hazards.  But the true adventure lies not only in the physical journey across light-years of space, but in the uncharted territories of the human spirit, pushing against the limits of exploration and the enduring search for something more than survival.
