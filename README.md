
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, a worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Her quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the relentless heat, but the thought of her people spurred her onward.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty – towering castles silhouetted against fiery sunsets, bustling market towns offering fleeting respite, and the chilling silence of the vast, empty landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter.' His mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a new form of faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was a daunting, beautiful terror.  Each jump through hyperspace risked encountering rogue asteroids or hostile pirate fleets.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting humanity to a galaxy teeming with the unknown, fueled his relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean, a journey vastly different yet equally perilous to Elara's medieval trek.
