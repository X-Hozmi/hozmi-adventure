
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.

But the promise of a new beginning for humanity, a fresh start amongst the stars, spurred her onwards through the inky black.
