
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned – a few meager coins, dried rations, and a well-thumbed map promising the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought the risk of bandits, starvation, or the harshness of the elements, but the hope of Eldoria spurred her on, a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness.  The journey was perilous, a constant test of endurance and will.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies. The vibrant nebulae painted a breathtaking canvas against the black backdrop of space as they navigated treacherous asteroid fields and navigated the complex gravitational pulls of distant suns.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, whispered to contain a source of limitless energy. The risks were colossal – rogue black holes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions – but the promise of a future fueled by Xylos's power made the unimaginable voyage worthwhile.  The vastness of space dwarfed their ship, but their determination burned brighter than any star.
