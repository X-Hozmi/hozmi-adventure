
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside, her worn leather satchel containing the last of her family's meager possessions.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present hunger. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising a new life beyond her ravaged village, fueled her weary spirit.  The journey was arduous, a constant test of endurance and will, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her cockpit.  Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were everyday occurrences, but the vastness of space held a different kind of danger, a loneliness that gnawed at even the most seasoned explorer.  Yet, the potential reward, a future free from galactic conflict, made the perilous voyage worthwhile.
