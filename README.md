
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic beat of hooves a counterpoint to the creak of his saddle.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by mythical beasts and brigands, but Reginald sought the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and evading the watchful eyes of hostile lords.  His journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily routine; the vast emptiness of space held a constant threat of unseen dangers.  But the possibility of finding a new home, a new beginning, fueled her intrepid spirit, pushing her across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
