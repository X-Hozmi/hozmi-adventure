His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought fresh dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, and the desperate hope for his sister's recovery, spurred him onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace. The vast expanse of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and dark matter, held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable peril.  The success of her mission – the survival of an entire colony – rested on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any medieval burden.
