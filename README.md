
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth’s surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward.  The midday sun beat down on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire, the distant Alps a hazy blue against the shimmering heat.  His quest, to retrieve the lost reliquary of Saint Jude, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense forests teeming with bandits, and across rivers swollen with spring melt. Each day brought new challenges – starvation, illness, and the constant threat of violence – but the allure of the sacred relic and the glory that its recovery promised spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, the *Hope*, believed stranded near the edge of known space.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all part of a day's work. The vast expanse of the cosmos held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, but the possibility of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of the *Hope’s* disappearance kept her engine humming towards the unknown.
