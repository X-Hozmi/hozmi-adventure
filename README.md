
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the skeletal remains of a forgotten castle looming on the horizon.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the relentless sun beat down mercilessly.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce supplies in isolated villages, and relying on the kindness – or indifference – of strangers.  The whispered legends fueled her onward, promising unimaginable riches and untold knowledge.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly creatures.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding hostile alien patrols was a constant battle against the odds. The galaxy held infinite possibilities, but only for those daring enough to reach for them.
