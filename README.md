
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's pardon, a forged letter promising riches, and a heart full of both fear and desperate hope.  His journey across the breadth of France, avoiding bandits and dodging the ever-present shadow of the plague, was a relentless test of endurance. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, hostile villages, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the rumoured lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold treasures, pushed him forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of engine failure were constant companions.  But unlike Thomas, Eva had the advanced technology of the 25th century at her disposal –  shielding, advanced navigation, and a crew of skilled specialists. Still, the vastness of space, the unknown nature of their destination, and the weight of humanity's future rested on her capable shoulders.
