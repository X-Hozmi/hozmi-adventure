
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World mountains, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Zerzura.  He carried with him only a meager supply of dried meat, a waterskin, and the whispered map promising untold riches and a cure for his ailing sister – a perilous journey fraught with bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a renewed hope that spurred him further.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Voidhawks,  Elara's journey demanded not only expert piloting skills, but also nerves of steel and a deep understanding of the unpredictable nature of interstellar space.  The rewards, however, were potentially galaxy-altering.
