The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest – to find the legendary Sword of Aethelred – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where brigands lurked. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the promise of a cold, hard bed beneath the open sky.  His only companions were the unwavering loyalty of his horse and the burning ember of hope in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, a far cry from the comfortable life she'd left behind on Earth. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even her most ambitious dreams.  Yet, the faint signal she’d intercepted, a whisper from a dying world, spurred her onward, a beacon in the infinite darkness.
