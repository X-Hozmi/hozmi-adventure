
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Elara's small caravan lumbered onward.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each snort from her weary mule, marked another mile in their perilous journey across the ravaged countryside.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed them like a malevolent specter.  Their destination, the mythical city of Zerzura, promised untold riches, but the path was fraught with hardship, demanding courage, resilience, and unwavering hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between stars, but the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who stalked the galactic highways, preying on unsuspecting transports.  The prize, however, was worth risking everything.
