
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched a crumpled map, its edges frayed from countless miles traversing the treacherous terrain between England and the Holy Land.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the whispered legends of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient power, fueled his relentless journey. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast, unforgiving landscape still before him.

Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey across the galaxy had been fraught with peril – asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unnerving silence of interstellar space had tested her crew's resilience. But the potential rewards, the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets, outweighed the risks a thousandfold.  The shimmering blue of Xylos, growing larger in their viewport, promised a future far beyond the stars.
