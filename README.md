
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst her people, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown pushed her further, a thirst for adventure burning brighter than any fear.  She carried with her not only a worn map and a meager supply of dried meat, but also the unwavering hope of finding something extraordinary.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a tapestry woven with the breathtaking beauty of cosmic wonders and the chilling reality of navigating asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across the vast expanse of nothingness, but the chance to contribute to the survival of a fledgling human colony fueled her courage and kept her hand steady on the controls.
