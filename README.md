
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked tracks as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d been travelling for months, his quest a desperate search for a mythical herb rumored to cure his sister's wasting illness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the vast, unknowable distance that separated him from his goal.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, tempered by the stark reality of the perilous journey ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her ship a tiny speck against the backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts flickered across her console, guiding her through swirling nebulae and past uncharted star systems.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth, was a lifetime’s ambition.  Though the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unknown perils of alien life – the spirit of adventure, that burning desire to explore the vastness beyond, was the same relentless force that had driven Thomas centuries before.
