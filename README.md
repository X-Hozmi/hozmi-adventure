
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's destrier as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide through the treacherous mountain passes.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the perilous thrill of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel as it breached the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae, dodging asteroid fields the size of small planets, and communicating with alien races whose languages were as vast and unknown as the cosmos itself were all in a day’s work.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potential, but shrouded in dangerous mystery.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, fueling Ava's relentless pursuit.
