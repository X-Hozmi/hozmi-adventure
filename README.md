
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his horse onward. The dusty track, barely a path through the unforgiving Breton countryside, stretched before him, a ribbon of brown snaking towards the distant, mist-shrouded mountains.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Brigid – had led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers, and into the heart of a simmering peasant revolt.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the chilling certainty that failure meant death, or worse, dishonor.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril; rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders haunted the vast emptiness of space.  But Eva, hardened by years spent charting the unknown, pressed on, driven by the hope of discovering new life and securing humanity's future amongst the stars.
