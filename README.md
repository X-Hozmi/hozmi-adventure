
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death were less daunting than her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel and chirping cicada was a soundtrack to her perilous journey, a symphony of hope and fear as she navigated treacherous passes and sought hospitality in unfamiliar villages.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of the ancient Proxima civilization.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet the vastness of space still held a chilling grandeur.  Cosmic rays crackled against the ship's hull, and the silent expanse between stars pressed upon her, a constant reminder of the immense distances and unpredictable dangers lurking in the unexplored reaches of the galaxy.
