
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him, urged his mule onward.  The shimmering heat haze of the Andalusian plains distorted the distant mountains, promising both respite and peril.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Samarkand and trade his family's woven tapestries for silks and spices, was a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, a desperate race against time and dwindling resources.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory cruisers of the Kryll Hegemony was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape and political intrigue that threatened her mission.  This was a journey not just across the vast expanse of space, but also a voyage through the treacherous currents of galactic power, where alliances shifted like the stars themselves and the cost of failure was annihilation.
