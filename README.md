
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her grandfather's maps and a desperate hope.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, spurred her onward, a tiny silhouette against the vastness of the medieval world.  Every sunrise promised a new challenge, every sunset a precarious victory.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her starship.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers was commonplace on her interstellar trade runs. The galaxy held riches beyond imagining, but also unimaginable dangers. This voyage, however, was different.  A distress beacon from a remote colony, a whisper of a lost technology, pulled her towards the unknown, a gamble against the vast, unforgiving canvas of space.  The stakes were higher than ever, the journey far more perilous.
