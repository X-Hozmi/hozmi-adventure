His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.

He relied on the kindness of strangers in isolated villages, the resilience of his aging horse, and the unwavering belief that his destination was worth the perils of the medieval road.

Her mission: to establish first contact with the sentient Xylossian civilization, a race rumored to possess technology far surpassing humanity's.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities. The galaxy awaited, a tapestry of wonder and danger.
