
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights spurred their mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the desperate hope of their people, fueled their weary bodies and resolute spirits.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to human endurance and the unwavering pursuit of a desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey that would span lightyears and test the limits of both ship and crew.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate patrols, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all in a day's work. But the breathtaking panoramas of celestial wonders, the thrill of discovering new planets, and the knowledge that she was contributing to the expansion of humankind, made the risks worthwhile. The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, yet also breathtakingly beautiful, was her battlefield and her playground.
