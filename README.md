
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the parchment map promising riches in a far-off kingdom – riches needed to save her family’s failing vineyard.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the lure of adventure, the chance to shape her own destiny, propelled her onwards, a tiny figure against the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the navigation console.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was proving problematic.  His crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, watched with bated breath as the hyperdrive sputtered, threatening to strand them in the unforgiving void between galaxies. The mission, to locate a new home for humanity, was fraught with danger: unpredictable wormholes, pirate raids from other star systems, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien species.  But the promise of a new dawn, a chance to rewrite humanity's fate, kept their hope – and engines – sputtering on.
