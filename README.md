
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for a legendary healer rumored to reside in the distant monastery of Saint-Alban.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, brought a fresh wave of anxiety and exhilaration. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the plague lurked around every bend in the unforgiving landscape, making her journey a constant test of endurance and courage.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Wanderer* a tiny speck against the vast tapestry of the cosmos.  The mission: to retrieve a vital mineral from the icy planet of Cryos, a world teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms. Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the inherent dangers of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien civilizations made each jump a heart-pounding gamble.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but exploration demanded unwavering bravery and a healthy dose of luck.
