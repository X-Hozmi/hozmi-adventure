
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward. The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind in Avignon.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each hesitant step of his horse, brought him closer to the unknown, a journey fraught with peril, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He clutched the tattered map, its edges frayed from countless nights spent huddled beneath the stars.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast distances she was traversing.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates – the thrill of exploration remained the same.  The vast, unknowable cosmos stretched before her, a tapestry of shimmering stars and uncharted worlds, beckoning her to uncover its countless mysteries.
