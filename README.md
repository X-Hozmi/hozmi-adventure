
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new landscape to navigate. The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand was her only guide, promising salvation or ruin depending on the whims of fate and the terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward.  Stars streaked past the viewport of the 'Stardust Drifter' as they jumped to the Andromeda Galaxy, a breathtaking spectacle even after countless voyages. This wasn't a pilgrimage; it was a salvage run – a desperate gamble for fortune amidst the swirling nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields.  The vastness of space held both incredible beauty and unimaginable danger, a constant dance between the thrill of discovery and the stark reality of sudden, catastrophic failure.  The galaxy was their battlefield, and the riches of distant worlds their prize.
