
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a chance to escape the famine gripping her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrubland, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harshness of the unforgiving landscape itself.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with fear and fortitude, a testament to the human spirit's unwavering quest for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of peril; asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating in the lawless fringes of known space.  His crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, relied on their advanced technology and unwavering camaraderie to navigate the cosmic ocean, a journey not of survival but of discovery, driven by humankind's insatiable curiosity and the promise of new worlds.
