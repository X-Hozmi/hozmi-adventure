
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains of France as Jean, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The map, a tattered scroll clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches beyond imagining in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests teeming with brigands, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of adventure, of the unknown, burned brighter than any fear.  Each creak of saddle leather, each clop of hoof on stone, was a step closer to destiny.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space krakens of the Outer Rim was a daily challenge, but Eva's courage never faltered.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying and exhilarating possibilities, a constant reminder of humanity's boundless ambition and the incredible risks undertaken to reach for the stars.
