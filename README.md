
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead, the Spine of the World mountains loomed, a jagged scar against the bruised purple sky.  My quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for my brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred me onward, a single flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones.  Stars blurred into streaks of incandescent light as we jumped between galaxies, the cosmos a swirling canvas of nebulae and uncharted territories. My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, presumed destroyed centuries ago.   The galaxy held countless dangers: pirate fleets, unmapped gravitational anomalies, and the chilling emptiness of space itself.  But the thought of finding even a single survivor, a testament to human resilience against the vast indifference of the universe, fueled my unwavering determination.
