
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored city of Ys, a mythical haven said to lie beyond the treacherous peaks, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the whisper of legend and the burning hope of finding a better life than the one she'd left behind.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa "Ry" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the ravaged colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system failures were all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar courier.  But Ry's greatest challenge lay in the vast, unknowable expanse of space itself, a humbling reminder of humanity's fragile position amidst the infinite wonders and dangers of the cosmos.
