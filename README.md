
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, the promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands of the south.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant color as the *Stardust Drifter* leaped across the void between galaxies.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The dangers weren't bandits or famine, but treacherous nebulae, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of uncharted cosmic anomalies.  Yet, the call of discovery, the allure of the unexplored,  burned brighter than any star in the vast, infinite darkness.
