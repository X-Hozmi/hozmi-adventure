
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and whispered legends, guided her towards the mythical city of Ys.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every league conquered, her determination burned brighter, fuelled by the whispers of Ys's glittering spires and the promise of untold riches, or perhaps, something far more valuable.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable wormholes, each a gamble with space and time itself.  The journey, a tapestry woven with breathtaking cosmic vistas and the constant hum of the hyperdrive, was a test of skill, courage, and unwavering hope for a new beginning amongst the stars.
