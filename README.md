
The year is 1348.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – rare herbs coveted by the monastery at the journey's end.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the perils of her solitary trek, but the thrill of adventure, of pushing her limits against the backdrop of a medieval world, spurred her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each gust of wind, was a story in itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the occasional twinkling star or the ominous shadow of a rogue asteroid, was a far cry from Elara's Pyrenean mountains, yet the same intrepid spirit fueled his journey.  The unknown beckoned, a cosmic expanse waiting to be explored, each hyperspace jump a gamble against the unforgiving laws of the universe.
