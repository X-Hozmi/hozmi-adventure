
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort from our pack animals was a testament to the arduous journey across the Iberian Peninsula.  We’d braved bandits, torrential rains that turned our path into a treacherous mire, and the ever-present threat of starvation, all in pursuit of the mythical city of El Dorado, whispered to lie hidden somewhere beyond these mountains.  Hope, thin as a cobweb, yet stubbornly clung to our hearts.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive, a constant thrum against the infinite blackness of space.  Seven years we’ve spent traversing the Andromeda galaxy, charting unknown nebulae and encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the cosmos. Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for humanity amidst the vast, uncaring expanse of the universe.  The stars are our guide, and the future, unwritten.
