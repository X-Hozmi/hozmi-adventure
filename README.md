Tales of treacherous bandits, mystical creatures, and unforgiving terrain were whispered in taverns along the way, each one adding to the allure of the unknown.

But for Anya and her crew, the allure of the unknown, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, was a siren song that beckoned them forward.
