
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried rations; it contains the hope of a new life, a rumored valley brimming with fertile land promised by a cryptic map.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe, testing her resilience and faith with each grueling mile.  The whispers of adventure lure her onward, despite the looming dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby as she charts a course towards the Andromeda galaxy, a destination promising untold riches in exotic minerals and the allure of undiscovered civilizations.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders are just part of the everyday challenges faced by intrepid explorers charting the cosmos.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offers a different kind of adventure, a thrilling gamble with the unknown, fueled by an insatiable human curiosity.
