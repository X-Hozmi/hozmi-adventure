
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mare across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's mysterious ailment.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, combined with her unwavering love for her brother, fuel her onward journey, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of medieval adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage demanding precise navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and unknown wormholes.  The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and existential danger, tests her courage and skill at every turn.  The fate of countless lives rests on her shoulders, a stark contrast to the medieval journey, but sharing the same core of unwavering determination and the relentless pursuit of a distant, hopeful goal.
