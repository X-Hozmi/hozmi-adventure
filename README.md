
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst travelling merchants.  His journey had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his resilience, but the lure of Eldoria, of untold riches and perhaps even magic, kept him pushing forward, a single, determined speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational forces of rogue planets was a constant struggle, but the thrill of interstellar travel, the breathtaking views of unimaginable celestial wonders, fuelled her determination. The vastness of space, while terrifying, also held a certain majesty, a promise of discovery that echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved the unknown on foot and horseback.
