
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all but minor inconveniences in the face of such a desperate journey. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of trepidation and determination, pushing her further along the ancient, rutted tracks towards a future she prayed for.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging pirate raids in uncharted sectors was a daily occurrence. The weight of responsibility rested heavily on her shoulders – each crew member, each lost soul from the colony ship, a testament to the perilous beauty and infinite dangers of interstellar travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of cosmic wonders and hidden horrors, held her captive in its awe-inspiring embrace.
