
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the treacherous terrain itself all threatened to end her journey before it reached its goal.  Her meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, yet the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos Cluster, Ryla's crew faced threats far more advanced than bandits –  space pirates, rogue gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present danger of hull breaches. Their mission: to locate the legendary planet of Aethel, said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of a unified galaxy fueled their perilous journey across the cosmos.
