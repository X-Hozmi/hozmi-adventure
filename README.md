
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the plague stalked the cities, and the very roads were treacherous.  Each day was a gamble, a test of endurance against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.  Yet, the lure of the distant, sacred city spurred him onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, uncertain horizon.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her ship's controls. Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms was commonplace; the vastness of space held both wonder and unimaginable danger.  But for Eva, the risk was worth the reward – the promise of a new dawn for her people, far beyond the dying embers of their home world.
