
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and dust-caked horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown lurking beyond the next ridge.  Yet, the promise of spices in the distant East fuels our journey, a potent elixir against hardship, a shimmering mirage guiding us through treacherous valleys and across raging rivers. We seek fortune, yes, but also the exhilaration of discovering what lies beyond the familiar, a thrill only a medieval adventurer can truly comprehend.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we navigate the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new dawn for humanity. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking spectacle of celestial bodies, is both terrifying and awe-inspiring.  We face dangers far beyond bandits and blizzards – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of uncharted alien life.  But the pursuit of a new home, a new beginning, outweighs the risks, driving us onward through the black, echoing expanse of the cosmos.
