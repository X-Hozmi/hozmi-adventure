
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea carried to the Sultan for aid against a encroaching horde.  Each creak of the saddle, each wary glance at the horizon, was a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey, a testament to the courage required to navigate a world largely unconquered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure safe passage through warring factions.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was as perilous as any medieval landscape.  The journey across galaxies demanded a different kind of courage, a resilience forged in the face of unimaginable distances and unknown dangers.
