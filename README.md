
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke mingling with the ever-present tang of sweat and fear. Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the precarious balance between life and death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily occurrence, the vast emptiness of space a far cry from the familiar dangers of medieval earth.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own set of challenges – temporal distortions, unexpected gravitational anomalies – all requiring the precise skill and unwavering nerve that defined a true starship captain.  The fate of countless worlds rested on her shoulders, a weight far heavier than any medieval burden.
