
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the smooth paths of courtly life she'd left behind.  Bandit-ridden passes, treacherous river crossings, and the constant gnawing hunger were daily trials. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each whispered prayer a bolster against the encroaching night, and each vista a reward for her perilous trek across the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and gas swirling around her starship.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and perilous asteroid fields.  While lacking the immediate physical hardships of Elara's journey, Eva faced different dangers – rogue black holes, alien encounters, and the constant pressure of maintaining life support systems light-years from Earth.  Yet, the vastness of space, the untamed beauty of nebulae, and the thrill of discovery fueled her onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for adventure.
