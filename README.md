
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of Aquitaine was fraught with peril, each sunrise bringing the threat of ambush or starvation.  Yet, the whispers of a legendary lost city, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic, fueled her onward.  The creak of saddle leather and the snorting of her weary steed were the soundtrack to her desperate gamble, a quest that could make her a legend or leave her bones to bleach under the unforgiving sky.


Millennia later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson light painting the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter' in eerie hues.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The jump through hyperspace had been brutal, the ship shuddering under the strain of traversing unimaginable distances.  But the allure of unlocking galactic exploration, of charting new worlds and encountering alien civilizations, far outweighed the risks.  Ahead lay uncharted territories and the promise of a future unbound by the limitations of space and time.
