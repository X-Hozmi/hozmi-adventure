
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded ink, guided her towards the legendary city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispering winds carried tales of mythical beasts guarding hidden valleys. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, parched deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cut a shimmering path across the nebula known as the Serpent's Kiss.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets in a far-flung galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates tested her crew's skills to the limit.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering uncharted anomalies, and the vast distances between star systems fostered a chilling sense of isolation. Yet, the hope of finding Xylos, and perhaps uncovering the secrets of their disappearance, propelled Ryla and her crew across the inky blackness, defying the vastness of space.
