
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the muddied tracks of the Ardennes forest.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down our spines.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far more daunting than any dragon. Our quest: to deliver a sacred relic to a distant abbey, a journey fraught with peril, but promising untold riches and glory if we survived.  Every sunrise was a gamble, every sunset a victory.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova, her weathered face etched with the lines of countless jumps, surveyed the swirling nebulae from the bridge.  The mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope swallowed by the vast emptiness of space.  The dangers were different now – hostile alien life, decaying starships, the creeping despair of interstellar loneliness – but the thrill of discovery, the push against the boundaries of the known, remained the same. The cosmos was our forest, and the journey was just beginning.
