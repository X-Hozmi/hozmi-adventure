Each rustle in the undergrowth brought a prickle of fear – bandits, wild animals, or worse, lurked in the shadows.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost relic of Saint Michael, a journey fraught with peril but promising unimaginable reward – or certain death. The ancient maps, stained and brittle, were his only guides through the untamed wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through the ship's metallic bones.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on unsuspecting transports.  But for Eva, the risk was overshadowed by the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and forging a future among the stars.
