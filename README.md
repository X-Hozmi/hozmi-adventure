
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of a unforgiving landscape.  But the hope burning in her heart, brighter than any sunset, fueled her onward through treacherous passes and across whispering plains.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of reversing the encroaching solar flare threatening her home planet.  The vast expanse of space held far more unknown dangers than any medieval trail—nebulae that could swallow a ship whole, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates. But the weight of responsibility, and the burning desire to save her people, drove her and her crew across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
