
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Brigid, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease stalk him and his weary companions. Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the grim possibility of failure.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, propels them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a voyage that takes years, not days.  The vastness of space, a chilling emptiness punctuated by the silent beauty of nebulae and the terrifying immensity of black holes, presents a unique kind of challenge.  Engine failures, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids are just a few of the hazards she must overcome, guided only by the faint signal from a long-lost beacon and her unwavering resolve.
