
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need to escape a shadowed past, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the forests, the roads were treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose propelled her forward, the promise of sanctuary at the end of this arduous path a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in parsecs, each hyperspace jump a gamble against unknown dangers.  Cosmic storms threatened to shatter her vessel, and the vast emptiness itself held an unnerving silence, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present whisper of the unknown.
