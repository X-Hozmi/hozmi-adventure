
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present hunger, but the hope of salvation fuels his relentless journey.  The shimmering mirage of distant oases offers fleeting comfort, a stark contrast to the harsh reality of his arduous pilgrimage across a land both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology capable of solving the galaxy-wide energy crisis.  Warp jumps across lightyears of cosmic dust and the constant threat of pirate raids make every moment a gamble.  The breathtaking panoramas of nebulas and alien worlds offer breathtaking distractions from the ever-present danger, yet the weight of her responsibility to find Kepler-186f and return with its life-saving technology rests heavily on her shoulders.
