
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion. Her worn leather satchel contains more than just supplies; it holds the hope of finding her brother, lost to the bandit-ridden King's Road months ago. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens her senses, heightening the ever-present danger and the exhilarating thrill of the unknown that fuels her perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The whispers of dragons in the north are as real to her as the ache in her muscles.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the inky black between galaxies. The hum of the hyperdrive is a lullaby, a constant reminder of the immense power she wields, propelling her towards the uncharted nebula Xylos. The mission: to locate a lost colony, a gamble against the vastness of space and the potential threats lurking in unexplored sectors.  The weight of countless lives rests on her shoulders, a pressure far greater than any earthly mountain, yet the thrill of discovery, the boundless potential of the cosmos, keeps her steadfast on course.
