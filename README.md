
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small company pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust in the fading sunlight.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary steps across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the distant colony of Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of famine.  Warp jumps across vast distances were fraught with peril – unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the thought of the colonists, their lives hanging in the balance, spurred Eva onward, a lone navigator charting a course through the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
