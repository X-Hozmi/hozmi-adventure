
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing the perilous route to the mythical city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges facing him and his small band of companions on this quest for fortune and glory – a journey fueled by whispered tales of unimaginable riches and a king’s ransom waiting for the brave souls who could find it.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of either death or discovery.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Captain Eva Rostova's ears as she navigated the swirling nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Xylos was a galaxy away, a journey fraught with dangers far beyond bandits and mountain passes.  Nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks tested the Althea's shields and the crew's resolve.  But the allure of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting a course to unmapped star systems, spurred them onward, their hearts filled with the same thirst for adventure that had driven Thomas and his companions centuries before.
