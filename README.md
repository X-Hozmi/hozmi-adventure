
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar perfume of the road.  He was bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague haunted every village. Yet, the lure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, propelled him relentlessly forward, each sunrise a promise of another step closer to his destiny.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting thrum against the vast, inky blackness.  Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula, a cosmic kaleidoscope of impossible colours.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harbouring life.  The journey across the galaxy had been long, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of warp currents.  But the potential discovery, the chance to expand human knowledge and reach for the stars, eclipsed any fear. This was a voyage into the unknown, a step into the grand, breathtaking future.
