
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of France.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the Hundred Years' War.  Each day brings new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, scorching deserts devoid of water, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of glory, and the hope of peace, spurs him onward, his loyal squire ever at his side, their journey a testament to the enduring human spirit's capacity for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a fleeing human civilization.  Faster-than-light travel allows for immense distances to be conquered, but the vastness of space holds its own perils: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, fueled by the hope of a new beginning for humanity, Elara presses onward, charting a course into the unknown, a pioneer of a new era of interstellar exploration.
