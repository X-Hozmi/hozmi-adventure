
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke battling the stench of mud and decay.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties meant to replenish a ravaged village far across the kingdom.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse; yet the unwavering glint of determination in her eyes burned brighter than any campfire. This journey was her life's purpose, a pilgrimage fueled by hope and resilience.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky void between galaxies.  Navigating by nebulae and quasars, Ryla and her crew sought the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse. Every jump risked catastrophic failure, every unknown system teemed with potential dangers, from rogue asteroids to hostile alien civilizations. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the promise of the unknown, fueled their daring expedition.
