
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had already claimed one of their number to fever.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless rhythm of horse hooves on rutted tracks, the shared hardships of meager rations, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present uncertainty of their destination.  But the lure of Jerusalem, and the promise of redemption, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years.  Advanced technology mitigated the physical hardships, yet the isolation was profound.  The vast emptiness of space, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown dangers created a different kind of tension, a psychological pressure that tested even the most seasoned interstellar voyager.  The weight of her responsibility, the fate of a lost civilization resting on her shoulders, fueled her journey across the cosmic sea.
