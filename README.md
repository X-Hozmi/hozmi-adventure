
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan’s weary horse as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in his gauntlet.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a lost kingdom.  Each day brings fresh peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless plains.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, fuels his every step, a flickering candle against the vast, indifferent darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaps across the void.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms are daily occurrences. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, dwarfs even the grandest medieval journeys.  The future holds unimaginable wonders, but also unimaginable dangers, as Elara pushes the boundaries of human exploration into the unfathomable expanse of the cosmos.
