
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and into the shadow of ancient, whispering forests.  Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of illness. Yet, the lure of the legendary shrine, promising healing and salvation, spurred them onward through the unforgiving medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the inky black of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago. Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging rogue planetary debris, and battling the occasional space pirate were all in a day’s work.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the sheer distance separating her from Earth, a tiny blue marble a lightyear away, hammered home the immense scale of her undertaking and the courage required to push the boundaries of human exploration.
