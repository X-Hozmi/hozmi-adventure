
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor substitute for the damp forests of her home.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of the plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the Duke, a journey fraught with peril, but one she would complete, for the fate of her village rested upon her weary shoulders. The unwavering sun beat down, a harsh reminder of the distance yet to cover.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Signals crackled from the comms, a garbled message from the distant colony of Kepler-186f. They needed assistance, a desperate plea cut short by static.  Though the journey across the galaxy was a perilous gamble, fraught with asteroid fields and unforeseen gravitational anomalies, Jax would answer the call. The fate of a colony rested on his daring flight, a voyage across the void far more daunting than any medieval trail.
