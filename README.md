
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The chill autumn wind whipped across the vast, empty plains of Aquitaine, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth.  His quest, a perilous journey to the rumored lost city of Ys, demanded unwavering courage and resilience.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles he faced, yet the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches spurred him onwards, each sunrise a new challenge in this unforgiving yet breathtaking land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through her bones as she navigated the treacherous asteroid field, dodging rogue space rocks and the occasional pirate vessel.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with strange, alien flora and fauna.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a different kind of challenge than Reginald's, but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned just as brightly in her heart.
