
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a desperate gamble to save her family's failing farm.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, with every sunrise, her determination burned brighter, fueled by the hope of a new life beyond the familiar, treacherous landscape.  The road stretched endlessly before her, a ribbon of uncertainty snaking through a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained: pirate fleets lurking in the asteroid fields, treacherous wormholes threatening to unravel spacetime, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  But Ryla, a seasoned explorer with a heart as vast as the cosmos, pressed on, her spirit undaunted by the immensity of her journey.
