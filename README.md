
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald’s boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the bleak landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the promise of bandit ambush or worse – the gnawing fear of the disease itself stalked him as relentlessly as the shadows lengthening across the plains.  He pressed on, fueled by hope and the desperate need to return home.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal detected only as a faint whisper amidst the cosmic static.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms was all part of a day's work, but the loneliness of interstellar travel pressed heavily on her crew.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered little comfort as they pursued the faint hope of finding survivors amongst the stars.
