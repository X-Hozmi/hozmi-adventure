His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse—the lingering, chilling breath of the plague itself.  His journey was a gamble against time and the unforgiving landscape, a testament to the courage born of desperate hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, was also a terrifying expanse of potential hazards— rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to collect rare isotopes crucial to sustaining life on Earth, a voyage demanding not just skill and courage, but a profound understanding of astrophysics and the unyielding heart of an explorer pushing the boundaries of human possibility.
