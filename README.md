
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the unpredictable whims of weather threatened to halt his progress entirely.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered legends of far-off lands, fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours masking the dangers within.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey far exceeding anything the medieval knights could have imagined.  Asteroids posed constant threats, while uncharted wormholes whispered promises of unimaginable wonders – or terrifying annihilation.  Communication with Earth was a tenuous connection across light-years, leaving her and her crew entirely self-reliant in the face of cosmic uncertainties.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a beauty as compelling as any earthly landscape, a constant reminder of the grand scale of the universe and the audacity of their exploration.
