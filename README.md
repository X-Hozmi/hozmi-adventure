
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, a barely-there track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless rain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of their journey – a pilgrimage to Canterbury, fraught with the perils of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The promise of salvation at journey's end barely outweighed the gnawing fear that stalked their every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The journey, measured in light-years, was a test of endurance, pitting her against cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the constant hum of the ship's aging engines.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, eclipsed the risks, fueling her unwavering determination to reach her distant goal.
