
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days blurred into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, swift rivers to ford, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Every sunset brought the chilling uncertainty of finding shelter, and the ever-present fear of the unseen dangers lurking in the vast, untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light years away, orbiting a star unseen from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril: asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize her ship, unpredictable wormholes that could spit them out anywhere in the galaxy, and the constant vigilance needed to avoid detection by the aggressive Zydonian Empire.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
