
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a map – a scribbled testament to a rumored lost city whispered about in hushed tones in taverns.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were far less daunting than the legend itself: a city of unimaginable wealth, protected by mythical beasts and ancient magic.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, fueled her relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien technology were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of light years, held both terrifying unknowns and the promise of a galaxy-altering discovery, a gamble she was willing to make for the sake of her people.
