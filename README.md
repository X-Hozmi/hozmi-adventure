
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume her before she reaches the monastery holding the legendary healer. The journey is a constant test of endurance and courage, a race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next quantum leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, and battling unpredictable warp storms, Ryla and her crew face perils far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  The vast expanse of space presents a different kind of challenge, one where the enemy is not just flesh and blood, but the unforgiving immensity of the cosmos itself.
