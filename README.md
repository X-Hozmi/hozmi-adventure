
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Reginald, his armor clanking, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his village.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the constant gnawing hunger. Yet, the unwavering faith in his mission, the camaraderie of his small band of companions, and the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly years ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate raiders was routine; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Eva's crew, a diverse team of explorers and scientists, faced the vast, unknowable expanse with courage and a shared hope of finding not just a lost colony, but the answers to questions that reached beyond the stars.
