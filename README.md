
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully beneath a bruised sky, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through a forest primeval, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every league of his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger; asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms tested her skills and nerve.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
