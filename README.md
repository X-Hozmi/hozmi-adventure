
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three packhorses laden with meager supplies, crested the windswept hill.  Below them, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne stretched out – a tapestry of green valleys slashed by dark, treacherous forests and rocky gorges.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint-Michel, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging their homeland. Each day brought new challenges; bandits lurking in the shadows, perilous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Their journey was a relentless test of courage, endurance, and unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth, rumored to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Unlike the medieval travelers before her, Eva faced threats far beyond bandits and starvation.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace navigation presented constant danger.  Yet, the vastness of space held a different kind of allure, a breathtaking majesty that spurred her onward, fueled by the hope of a future for mankind amongst the stars.
