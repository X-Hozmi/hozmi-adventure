
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I rode eastward, a lone figure silhouetted against the bruised dawn sky.  My journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, had already claimed two pack mules and nearly cost me my life at the hands of brigands in the Black Forest.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the lure of Ys, with its whispered tales of unimaginable wealth and arcane knowledge, propelled me onward, a stubborn ember against the cold wind.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant lullaby as we navigated the Cygnus X-1 nebula.  My mission: to recover a lost data core containing the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  Unlike the medieval knights who faced tangible threats, my peril was unseen, a cosmic radiation storm, or perhaps the unknown alien intelligence lurking in the uncharted systems. The vastness of space, an unforgiving canvas of glittering stardust and black holes, held a different kind of fear, a loneliness that pressed against the soul even in the company of my crew.
