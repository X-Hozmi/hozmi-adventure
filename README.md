
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The scent of pine and damp earth mingled with the ever-present fear – bandits roamed these heights, and the whispers of wild beasts echoed through the jagged peaks.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, drove her onward, fueled by whispered legends and a desperate hope for a better life. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic landscape outside.  While the dangers were less tangible than bandits or wild beasts – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the stakes were infinitely higher.  The fate of humanity, it seemed, rested on this single, perilous voyage across the galaxy.
