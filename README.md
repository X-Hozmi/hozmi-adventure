
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and grime, trudged onwards, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Each step was a victory against the relentless terrain and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Our destination, the fabled city of Constantinople, seemed a distant dream, yet the lure of its exotic markets and untold riches spurred us onward, fueled by meager rations and the burning desire for adventure.  The rough-hewn map clutched in my hand, its edges frayed and stained with sweat, was our only guide through this untamed wilderness.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebulae outside, guided our ship through the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, with the possibility of encountering alien life, both benevolent and hostile.  Our mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vast emptiness of space, though daunting, held a certain majesty, a thrilling promise of discovery that dwarfed even the grandest medieval quest.
