
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his weary steed onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones across taverns and campfires, drove him relentlessly.  Days bled into weeks, a kaleidoscope of sun-drenched plains giving way to treacherous mountain passes, the constant threat of bandits and wild beasts a grim companion.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, but the vastness of the unknown land, and the uncertain loyalty of his own band of weary travelers, weighed heavy on his soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal from which had sparked hope after decades of silence.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, the vast emptiness of interstellar space a chilling counterpoint to the vibrant colours of alien star systems flashing past.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the thrill of the unknown, the unwavering push towards a distant goal, echoed the timeless spirit of adventure that had driven explorers for millennia.
