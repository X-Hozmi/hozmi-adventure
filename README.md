
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of  Alexandria, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the unwavering hope in her heart, fueled by the stories of ancient wonders, kept her moving.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, new encounters, and a deepening appreciation for the vastness and unpredictable nature of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of the cosmos remained awe-inspiring.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the edge of known space, rumored to possess technology that could save her dying homeworld.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien maps were just some of the hurdles she faced.  The journey, a voyage across unimaginable distances, tested her courage and ingenuity, but the promise of discovery and the potential to save billions fueled her relentless pursuit of the lost colony.
