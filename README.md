The King's decree, a summons to the distant, rumored-to-be-magical city of Eldoria, spurred him on.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the endless expanse of the plains baked under a relentless sun, and the rivers, swollen with spring rains, posed treacherous crossings.  Each day was a gamble against the elements and the brutality of man, each night a desperate hope for survival until Eldoria, a shimmering beacon of promise, might finally appear on the horizon.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, was a constant test of skill and nerve.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to find new life and expand humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her unwavering determination, pushing her and her crew beyond the known limits of space and time.
