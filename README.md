
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a few meager coins, and the map – a crude thing, promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  This journey was a gamble against the odds, a desperate race against time, fueled by a sister's unwavering love.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The shimmering cosmic dust, a breathtaking spectacle, hid treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable gravitational currents.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, filled with both wonder and peril, tested her courage and skill as she charted a course through unmapped galaxies, a lone explorer on a quest of unimaginable scale.
