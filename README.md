The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of opulent cities and fearsome beasts that fueled his journey east.  Each creak of the saddle, each cautious step through the dense forest, was a brush with the unknown – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease all shadowed his quest for a legendary lost monastery said to hold ancient wisdom.  His pack, heavy with meager supplies and even heavier with hope, was all that stood between him and the unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of celestial bodies swirling in the void.  Unlike the medieval traveler's limited horizon, Eva's journey was unbound, the vast expanse of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The risk of encountering unforeseen cosmic phenomena, or even hostile alien life, was a price she willingly paid for the chance to discover new worlds and expand humanity's reach across the galaxy.
