
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the gleam of hope, fueled by fierce loyalty, pushed her onward, through the heart of a medieval world brimming with both beauty and brutality.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily routine, punctuated by the breathtaking spectacle of alien landscapes and the quiet hum of the hyperdrive.  The vastness of space held both promise and peril, but for Nova, the challenge of exploring the galaxy was an irresistible allure, a far cry from the grounded conflicts of her ancestors.
