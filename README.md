
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her mule laden with meager supplies.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, not just from the cold, but from the palpable sense of unknown dangers lurking in the shadows of the unforgiving landscape.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the notorious Kryll pirates was all in a day's work, but the real challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  A single miscalculation could mean the difference between a groundbreaking discovery and oblivion in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
