
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped snow into my face, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched fields of my homeland.  This journey across the frozen wastes to the fabled city of K'tharr was fraught with peril – bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large.  Yet, the whispered tales of its ancient magic, and the promise of untold riches, spurred me onward, each labored step a testament to my unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant colour as we navigated the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning millennia for those who stayed behind.  Our mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – rogue black holes, uncharted nebulae, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the potential rewards – the unlocking of interstellar travel for all mankind – made the perilous journey worth the gamble.
