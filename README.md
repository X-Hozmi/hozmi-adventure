
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the breadth of Europe had been brutal; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains tested their mettle, and the endless expanse of open fields baked under the relentless sun. Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary city of Ys, hidden somewhere beyond the misty mountains, fuelled his relentless pursuit, each hardship only strengthening his resolve to reach his fabled destination.  He carried with him not only his sword but also the hope of a lifetime.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through a nebula of iridescent dust.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space presented challenges far removed from Sir Reginald's:  navigating treacherous asteroid fields, repairing critical systems under the threat of solar flares, and battling the psychological toll of prolonged isolation.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to find life beyond Earth, spurred her crew onward, their journey a testament to humanity's relentless quest to explore the unknown.
