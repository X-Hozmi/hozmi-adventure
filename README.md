
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our worn leather boots.  Ahead lay a treacherous path across the Pyrenees, then the vast, unforgiving plains of Castile, our destination – the mythical city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the secrets of forgotten alchemists. Each sunrise brought the risk of bandit raids, starvation, or the deadly fever that stalked the land. We relied on the kindness of strangers, the strength of our mounts, and the unwavering hope that fueled our quest for knowledge and fortune.

Millennia later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun, rumored to hold a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The risks were different now – nebula storms that threatened to tear our ship apart, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present danger of system malfunctions.  But the thirst for discovery burned as brightly as ever, guided by star charts and the unwavering belief in pushing the boundaries of human exploration into the unimaginable expanse of the cosmos.
