
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom – not in gold, but in rare spices promised to a Venetian merchant.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry or worse.  She pressed onward, spurred by the whispered promises of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, and the hefty reward that awaited her in the bustling port city of Marseilles. The journey was perilous, but the freedom of the open road, the camaraderie of fellow travelers encountered along the way, made it a life worth living.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly alien flora.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, shrinking galactic distances into manageable jumps. Yet, the vast emptiness between stars held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The galaxy was a vast, unforgiving ocean, but for Nova, the ultimate adventure lay in exploring its uncharted depths.
