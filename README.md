
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of the unknown – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled her onward, a lone adventurer in a vast and unforgiving world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the vastness of space held a different kind of fear – the chilling isolation of the cosmos and the unpredictable nature of unknown alien life.  But Eva, driven by the insatiable human hunger for discovery, pressed on, a pioneer charting a course into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
