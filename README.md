
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, a knight errant with a thirst for glory and a map older than his lineage, rode toward the Whispering Mountains.  His quest: to find the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of uniting the warring kingdoms.  His journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onward, his loyal steed his only companion against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond charted space, a sanctuary for a dying people.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic engine failure, asteroid fields threatened hull breaches, and the chilling emptiness of space itself was a constant companion.  But Ryla, seasoned by countless voyages and fueled by a burning sense of responsibility, pressed on, her crew a family bound by shared peril and the hope of finding a new beginning among the stars.
