
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the scent of pine and woodsmoke battling the acrid tang of approaching storm.  Her journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, each village a new story, each hardship a testament to her resilience.  The whispered legends of the Holy Land, the promise of salvation, were a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations in slower ships.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of alien worlds and the chilling emptiness of void, tested her courage daily. Yet, the hope of reuniting with lost kin, the possibility of discovering new life, ignited a fire within her that burned brighter than any star.  The galaxy was her canvas, and exploration her brushstroke.
