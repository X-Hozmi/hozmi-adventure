
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a few dried figs, a worn map, and the unwavering hope of finding her estranged brother.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the distant Silk Road, promising both wealth and reunion, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil, charting a course towards the Xylos system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby masking the vast emptiness of interstellar space.  Her mission: to secure a vital mineral deposit crucial to the Galactic Federation's survival.  But the Xylos system was notorious for pirate activity and volatile planetary conditions.  The journey promised unimaginable riches, but the cost might well be Ryla's life, a gamble she was willing to take for the future of her people.
