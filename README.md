Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.

But the hope of discovering extraterrestrial life, of charting a new course for humanity, overshadowed any fear.  The galaxy awaited, a vast and unknown ocean waiting to be explored.
