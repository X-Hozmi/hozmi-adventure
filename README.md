
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a worn map, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit attack or worse – the whispers of the Black Death stalked the land, a greater terror than any highwayman. Her journey was a gamble against starvation, disease, and the unpredictable whims of fate, but the lure of Eldoria's legendary riches and rumored healing waters kept her pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered on the bridge's holographic display, guiding her through the treacherous asteroid field toward the Kepler-186f system.  The mission: to establish a vital trade route between the burgeoning colonies, a perilous undertaking fraught with the risks of warp storms, pirate attacks from the ruthless Kryll, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, life forms.  The vast expanse of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also a terrifying isolation, making each successful jump to hyperspace a victory hard-won.
