
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel, heavy with the weight of her late father's maps and a dwindling supply of dried meats, was her only companion on this perilous journey to the rumored hidden city of Ys.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the endless, dusty plains offered little respite from the scorching sun.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for danger, but the whispered legends of Ys fueled her courage, pushing her onward despite the gnawing fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond even the known galaxies.  The journey was fraught with the unpredictable hazards of hyperspace – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone vessels. But the promise of unlocking a new era of galactic exploration, the chance to rewrite the history of mankind's place in the cosmos, pushed Razor and his crew further into the inky black, bravely navigating the uncharted territories of the vast unknown.
