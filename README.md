
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the known world, propelled him forward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving expanse of medieval Europe and the desert beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic storms and rogue asteroids; instead of starvation, the threat of oxygen deprivation and equipment failure. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  The unknown beckoned, a promise of discovery and danger in equal measure, pushing her and her crew to the very limits of human endurance.
