
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his horse weary, crested the hill.  Before him lay not the promised vineyard of Burgundy, but a seemingly endless expanse of the French countryside.  His journey, begun in the sun-drenched lands of Provence, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the glint of distant spires, promising shelter and perhaps even a warm hearth, spurred him onward.  Each step was a gamble, each mile a victory against the unforgiving landscape and its inhabitants.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey, a year-long odyssey across the vast emptiness of space, had tested the ship and crew to their limits.  Radiation storms, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders had become commonplace.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, fueled their unwavering determination.  The distant emerald glow of Kepler-186f, a beacon in the inky black, offered the hope of a groundbreaking future.
