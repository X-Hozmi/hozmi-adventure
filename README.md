
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he rode, the sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the blighted lands.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown spurred him on, the promise of glory and the possibility of saving his people eclipsing the hardship. The journey was as much a test of his physical and mental strength as it was a search for a mythical artifact.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the dangers were no less real.  Rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the constant threat of engine failure made every jump a gamble.  But the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning, fueled her and her crew, driving them forward into the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
