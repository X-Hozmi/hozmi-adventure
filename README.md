
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through her as she pressed onward, driven by the whispered promise of a legendary lost city rumored to hold untold riches – or perhaps, just the solace of a warm hearth.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, unpredictable, but the lure of the unexplored Xylos system, whispered to hold a planet teeming with life unlike any seen before, was too strong to resist.  The hum of the engines, the ever-present thrum of the warp drive, were a constant reminder of the vastness of space, the immense distances separating her from home and the potential dangers lurking beyond the veil of starlight.  The quest for knowledge, the thirst for discovery, propelled her forward into the unknown.
