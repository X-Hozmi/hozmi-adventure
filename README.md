
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise – or threat – of adventure.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the challenges she faced on her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, seeking the lost scrolls of Al-Razi.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages mingled with the metallic tang of blood from a recent hawk kill, a constant reminder of the raw, untamed beauty of her journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the Kepler-186f system.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a familiar lullaby, a counterpoint to the alien beauty of the cosmos unfolding outside her viewport.  Her mission: to establish first contact with a potential sentient species.  But the vastness of space held unforeseen dangers; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the chilling possibility of encountering a hostile civilization all loomed larger than any earthly threat.  The adventure, however, was worth the risk.
