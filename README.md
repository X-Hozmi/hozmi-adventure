
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his mule onward.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the already indistinct shapes of the distant mountains, their peaks promising both refuge and peril.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the parched undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or the far more terrifying unknown that lay beyond the borders of his kingdom.  His quest – a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic – felt more a fool's errand with every passing league, but the lure of adventure, and perhaps salvation, kept his weary legs moving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of subspace currents always held a thrill, a stark reminder of the vastness and inherent danger of galactic exploration.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a remote planet rumored to be guarded by sentient crystal beings. The risks were immense, but the potential rewards – ensuring the survival of her people – outweighed the fear of the unknown, of encountering alien civilizations, or even navigating the treacherous gravitational pulls of a dying star.
