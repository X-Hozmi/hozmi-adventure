Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of bandits or worse – the whispers of plague that stalked the land were a constant companion.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of K'tharr and retrieve a stolen relic, was fraught with peril, demanding both courage and cunning to overcome the treacherous landscapes and the even more treacherous people she encountered along her arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the occasional rogue asteroid field or gravitational anomaly, presented a different kind of challenge than the medieval world; a test not of survival against man and nature, but against the unforgiving laws of physics and the mysteries of the cosmos.
