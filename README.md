
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the tales of spice-laden winds and shimmering silks whispered in taverns back in York. He carried a king's decree, a dangerous mission to deliver a message across the treacherous lands to the distant Duke of Aquitaine. Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of the plague lurked in the shadows of every forest and alongside every river.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart; it was an adventure etched in sweat, grit, and the constant whisper of survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky black between galaxies. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, reassuring presence against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae swirling like cosmic paint strokes. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades prior.  The galaxy held countless wonders and dangers; alien leviathans, uncharted asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of temporal anomalies threatened her crew. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover the colony’s fate, spurred them onward, their adventure a quest played out amongst the stars.
