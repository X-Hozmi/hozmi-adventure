
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a prayer against bandits and the ever-present chill wind whistling across the bleak, windswept moors.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Samarkand, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones in smoky taverns, a destination promising both riches and peril.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce supplies in dusty villages, and constantly watching the horizon for signs of trouble.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart; it was a test of endurance, wit, and sheer survival.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion, a thrumming counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas unfolding outside the viewport.  Nebulae painted the void in strokes of incandescent colour, while distant galaxies spiralled in hypnotic patterns.  My mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both wonder and unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel masked a constant pressure: the fragility of the ship, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on lone vessels.  This was exploration on a cosmic scale, a voyage far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travellers.
