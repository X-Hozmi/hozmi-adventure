His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's sickness.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the legendary city, a siren song echoing in his heart. Each creak of saddle leather, each labored breath of his horse, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble played with his life against the promise of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting drone against the vast, inky expanse of space.  Asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were commonplace hazards on the interstellar trade routes. Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and encountering alien civilizations, fueled her relentless journey, making the perilous voyage a thrilling, albeit dangerous, adventure.
