The trail, a barely-there track through the whispering pines, led him deeper into the untamed wilds of the Barony of Blackwood.  Rumours of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Elara, fueled his perilous journey.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by breathtaking celestial displays, held a different kind of wildness than Blackwood Forest, but the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly within her.
