
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the scorching sun, but the glint of gold in her pouch – a reward promised for delivering a sacred relic to Constantinople – spurred her onward.  Each rustle in the tall grass, each shadow cast by the setting sun, whispered of potential danger: bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands, and the sheer necessity of reaching her destination pushed her further into the heart of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Kestrel piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the occasional asteroid alert.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Rexx faced dangers far beyond the physical – treacherous space anomalies, hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But the promise of new worlds, the uncharted territories of the galaxy, and the spirit of exploration drove him and his crew across the vast cosmic ocean.
