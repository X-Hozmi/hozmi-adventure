
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate flight from bandits after a disastrous encounter near York.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the rhythmic thud of hooves on rough tracks, the stench of damp earth and woodsmoke, and the constant gnawing fear of ambush.  They navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers, and slept under a sky thick with stars, their hope fueled by the promise of sanctuary and the tales of miracles performed at the cathedral.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a revolutionary energy source.  The journey spanned light-years, each jump a gamble against unpredictable space-time distortions and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The sterile hum of the ship’s engines was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking cosmic vistas displayed on the viewport - swirling galaxies, distant suns, and the eerie beauty of nebulas.  Reaching Kepler-186f meant facing unknown dangers, but the potential rewards were worth the risk.
