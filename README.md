
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse.  His quest: to recover the stolen reliquary of St. Jude, a journey fraught with peril, from bandits ambushing lonely roads to the unpredictable whims of nature.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, from fording raging rivers to navigating treacherous mountain passes, testing his courage and the loyalty of his small band of companions.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, from rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human exploration and testing the limits of her ship and her crew's resolve.
