
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset a renewed determination to push further, fueled by whispered legends and the burning ember of hope in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Nebula storms threatened to rip her ship apart, while unknown alien entities lurked in the void between stars.  Yet, the possibility of finding her missing kin, the allure of unexplored worlds, and the unwavering spirit of the human explorers drove her ever onward, a modern-day odyssey amongst the cosmic tapestry of the universe.
