
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling into the abyss, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, forging a strength she never knew she possessed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the unknown.  Hyperdrive jumps risked tearing the ship apart, alien predators prowled the void between stars, and the ever-present threat of navigation errors could leave them adrift in the unforgiving darkness.  But the hope of finding the colonists, of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fueled her and her crew on this daring, interstellar odyssey.
