
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed on toward the distant, snow-capped peaks.  My journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding the lost secrets of alchemy, had already claimed half my supplies and tested my resolve more than once.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were small prices to pay for the chance to uncover knowledge lost to time. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a bittersweet victory as I crept closer to my elusive goal.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cockpit as we hurtled toward the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unseen dangers; a single miscalculation could mean obliteration.  Our mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's burgeoning population.   The vast, star-dusted canvas of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held the promise of a new beginning, or a catastrophic end.  The fate of billions rested on the success of our perilous voyage.
