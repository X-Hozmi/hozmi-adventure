
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map, promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the secrets of a lost civilization.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the Inquisition, hot on her trail for her heretical beliefs.  The journey was perilous, each day a gamble against starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the ever-present anxiety of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes.  Unlike Elara, Eva faced threats not of bandits, but of cosmic radiation, rogue planets, and the ever-present danger of system failure in the unforgiving expanse of space.  The stakes were cosmic, the adventure far more technologically advanced, but the thrill of the unknown, the pulse of discovery, remained the same.
