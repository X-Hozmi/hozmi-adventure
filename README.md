
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant city of Porthaven.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of a medieval landscape unforgiving to the unprepared.  Her adventure was a gamble, a perilous thread woven through hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant colony on the edge of known space.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, star-dusted silence.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample, a potential cure for a devastating plague ravaging Earth.  But the galaxy held many dangers, from rogue space pirates to unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  Eva's adventure wasn't just a journey through space; it was a race against time, a gamble against the unforgiving odds of the cosmos.
