
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate journey from war-torn Aquitaine to the rumored sanctuary of Avignon. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered of potential danger – bandits, starvation, the ever-present chill of the mountains. Yet, with every sunrise, the unwavering resolve in her heart burned brighter than the morning sun.  This perilous journey, though fraught with uncertainty, was her only path to freedom.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  The journey to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace, had already consumed months.  Beyond the porthole, swirling colours of gas giants and distant galaxies played out an eternal, awe-inspiring ballet.  But the calm beauty masked the ever-present dangers of hyperspace – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates.  This voyage, though technologically advanced, carried its own unique brand of peril, testing the captain's courage and ingenuity with each passing star system.
