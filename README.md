
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild animals, or the sickness itself.  But the hope of salvation, of returning a hero, spurred him across treacherous mountains and sun-baked plains, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, the crimson nebula of Xylos burning bright outside her viewport. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The jump to hyperspace was a violent lurch, followed by the endless black punctuated only by distant starlight.  The journey was fraught with the peril of unexpected asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the constant hum of anxiety that came with navigating the uncharted vastness of the galaxy, a journey far removed from the medieval adventurer’s concerns but equally fraught with the thrill of discovery and the risk of utter annihilation.
