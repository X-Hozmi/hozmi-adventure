
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's caravan lumbered across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each flash of a hawk circling overhead, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispered tales of djinn and mythical beasts fueled both their fear and their fascination.  Their destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, felt as distant as the stars themselves, a shimmering beacon in a sea of hardship and uncertainty.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for scarce supplies in dusty villages.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between space and time, yet the thrill of exploration remained.  Each jump to a new star system presented a unique gamble; uncharted planets promising untold riches or hidden dangers.  Communication with distant colonies was sporadic, creating a sense of exhilarating isolation.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, relied on their skill and courage as they faced alien landscapes, hostile indigenous species, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning technology – the price of venturing beyond the known boundaries of humanity.
