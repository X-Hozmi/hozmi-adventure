
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her homespun tunic. Her journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering faith in her heart, and the hope of finding her missing brother, fueled her onward.  The vastness of the medieval world was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant test of endurance and spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey across galaxies was a symphony of starlight and calculated risk, navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and battling the occasional pirate raid. While the technology offered a level of safety unknown to Elara, the vastness of space held its own brand of terror: the sheer isolation, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the constant threat of encountering the unknown, all made each hyperspace jump a gamble.
