
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of thyme and rosemary battling the stench of sweat and fear.  Her worn leather map, crinkled and stained with rain and wine, was her only guide to the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of plague.  Each sunset brought a new peril, a new test of her endurance, but the whisper of silk and spices, of unimaginable riches, kept her moving forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and warp storms was child's play compared to the political intrigue and corporate espionage that threatened her mission.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking spectacle of celestial wonders, concealed dangers as profound as any medieval forest – pirates, rogue A.I., and the crushing weight of isolation.  Yet, the promise of a new home, a fresh start for humanity, propelled her onward.
