
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the brutal indifference of the unforgiving landscape. Yet, the whispered legends of the monastery, and the unshakeable faith in their hearts, propelled them ever closer to their seemingly impossible goal.

Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was fraught with peril.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates haunted her every move. But the promise of a new beginning, a chance for humanity to expand beyond its dying homeworld, fueled her crew and kept their spirits high, despite the daunting immensity of the interstellar void.
