
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the city, and the hope it represented, spurred him onward, a lone knight against a vast and hostile world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding in time with the ship's hyperdrive.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of genetically modified crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory space pirates of the Black Quadrant were just a small part of the risks involved in interstellar trade, the vastness of space a constant reminder of both the incredible distances and the crushing loneliness of life on the galactic frontier.
