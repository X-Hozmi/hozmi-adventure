
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to their arduous journey.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their perilous trek, their only guide the fading whispers of legend and the unwavering glint of hope in their eyes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, stranded beyond the known reaches of the Galactic Federation.  Warp jumps were treacherous, alien encounters unpredictable, and the vastness of space itself a constant reminder of their isolation.  Yet, fueled by the hope of reunion and the promise of new discoveries, Eva and her crew braved the dangers of the cosmos, charting a course through unmapped galaxies in pursuit of a lost civilization.
