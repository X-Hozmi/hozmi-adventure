
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast, untamed landscape of France stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, the promise of a new life in the rumored fertile valleys of the south.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting constant against the vast, indifferent blackness of space.  Unlike the medieval travelers, Eva faced threats far more subtle yet no less deadly: unforeseen gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, extraterrestrial life. But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds for humanity, fueled her journey across the galactic frontier.
