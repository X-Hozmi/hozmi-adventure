His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in the forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding population.  Warp jumps and asteroid fields were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the unknown alien lifeforms that might await them.  For Eva, the stars weren't just a destination; they represented humanity's future, a future she was determined to secure.
