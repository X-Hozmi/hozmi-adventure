
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of Zerzura fueled his determination, pushing him ever closer to his perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate attack, she relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering courage. The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the knowledge that lives depended on her successful journey made every risk worthwhile.
