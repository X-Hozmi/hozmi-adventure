
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of York, a cart laden with salted cod and dreams as our only companions.  The rutted tracks offered little respite from the relentless sun and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creaking wheel spoke of hardship; each passing village, a fleeting glimpse into lives vastly different from our own.  We braved treacherous mountain passes and forded icy rivers, the looming castles and monasteries along the way both promising sanctuary and hinting at potential dangers within their formidable walls.  Our destination, the fabled spice markets of Constantinople, felt both tantalisingly close and impossibly far.

Centuries hence, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts a silent path through the nebula.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising life beyond our own dying sun.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  We navigate asteroid fields with practiced ease, dodging pirate vessels and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, share stories and anxieties under the cool light of the ship's hydroponics bay, their faces illuminated by the swirling colours of distant galaxies visible through the viewport.  The promise of discovery burns brighter than any star.
