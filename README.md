
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I led my small band across the unforgiving Bavarian Alps.  Each step was a victory against the biting wind and treacherous terrain;  every creak of the pack animals a reminder of the precious cargo we carried – silks destined for the King's court.  Bandit raids, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving elements were constant companions on our arduous journey, a testament to the courage and resilience required to traverse the medieval world. The reward, however, lay in the thrill of the unknown, the satisfaction of overcoming immense obstacles, and the undeniable allure of distant lands.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting roar against the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  My destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun, light-years from my home world.  The thrill wasn't just in the breathtaking speed of travel, but the sheer audacity of it – traversing the vastness of the cosmos, encountering alien civilizations, charting unmapped nebulae. While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the potential hostility of unknown species – the spirit of adventure remained unchanged, a burning ember passed down through time from those medieval travelers who braved the mountains to those who brave the stars.
