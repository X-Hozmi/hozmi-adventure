
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, blizzards threatened to bury her alive, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any man.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, a city said to hold unimaginable power, spurred her onward, each hardship a step closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his cockpit.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with both valuable resources and equally dangerous alien lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the inherent risks of navigating treacherous asteroid fields, encountering hostile pirate fleets, and dealing with unpredictable planetary weather remained a constant threat to his crew and their mission's success.
