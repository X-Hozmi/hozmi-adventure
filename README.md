
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurk in shadowed forests,  disease clings to the air like a shroud, and the endless expanse of the road tests both her physical and mental fortitude. Yet, each sunrise brings renewed hope, the promise of another village, another shared meal, another step closer to her sacred destination, a journey that weaves a tapestry of hardship and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  While lacking the immediate threats of bandits and plague, the cosmos presents its own dangers: rogue asteroids, uncharted nebulae that threaten to swallow the *Stardust* whole, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel. But the potential discoveries, the chance to unveil new worlds and civilizations, fuel Lyra's unwavering spirit, propelling her across the vast emptiness of space towards the unknown.
