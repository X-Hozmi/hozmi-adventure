
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of far-off lands – the shimmering silks of the East, the sun-drenched vineyards of France, the brutal, unforgiving steppes.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unforgiving elements, but the lure of adventure, of seeing the world beyond his small village, burned brighter than any fear. He carried with him only a worn map, a handful of coins, and a heart full of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense distances between worlds.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vastness of space, teeming with uncharted territories and untold wonders, fueled her every action, a cosmic echo of Thomas's medieval journey.
