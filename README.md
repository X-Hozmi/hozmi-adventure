
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and magic, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril, a constant dance between hope and the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving elements.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos, a canvas of nebulae and swirling starlight, stretched before her, yet the journey was far from romantic.  Navigation charts were unreliable, wormholes unstable, and the ever-present threat of space pirates loomed.  Still, the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, fueled her onward, a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the infinite.
