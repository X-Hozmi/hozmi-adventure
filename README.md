
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the biting winds of the high passes gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura’s untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, a flicker of hope in the vast, indifferent wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos system was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of intergalactic travel permits, but the allure of the uncharted nebula K'tharr, rumored to hold a civilization older than recorded time, outweighed any inconvenience.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, each with their own motivations and fears, shared a common thirst for the unknown, a yearning to push the boundaries of human knowledge into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
