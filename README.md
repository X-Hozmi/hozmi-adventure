Asteroid fields threatened to pulverize her ship, and the unpredictable space-weather could fry her navigational systems in an instant.  Yet, Eva, driven by the urgency of her mission and the promise of a galaxy teeming with wonders, pressed on, a solitary explorer charting the unknown expanse of the cosmos.
