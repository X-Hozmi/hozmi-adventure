
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the constant gnawing hunger was a companion as unwelcome as the cold.  Yet, the lure of the sacred city, the hope of redemption and the thrill of the unknown pushed him relentlessly forward, each sunrise a new chapter in his arduous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been a risky one, pushing the ship's Alcubierre drive to its limits.  Now, with alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport and the hum of the engines a constant background thrum,  Elara faced the unknown – a potentially hostile civilization on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to possess technology far surpassing her own. But the promise of untold discoveries and the challenge of charting unmapped territories fuelled her relentless pursuit of the cosmos.
