
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the relentless sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to curing the plague that ravaged her village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glimmer of hope, the whisper of Zerzura's healing waters, fueled her onward, pushing her past exhaustion and despair.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos reflected in the viewport of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanium crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with pirate attacks and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and swirling gas clouds, held a different kind of peril, a terrifying beauty that both thrilled and terrified him.  His destination, a distant colony on the edge of explored space, felt impossibly far, yet the gravity of his duty propelled him forward through the inky black.
