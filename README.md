
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, trudged onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already tested their mettle – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease lurking in every shadowed village. Yet, the glint of distant spires fueled their weary legs; the promise of spiritual solace and legendary relics spurred them across the ravaged landscape of medieval Europe, each step a testament to their courage and faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a jewel nestled within a distant star system.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace.  But the true adventure lay in the unknown, the thrill of charting uncharted territories among the cosmos, and the possibility of discovering something extraordinary – perhaps even other life – in the vast, awe-inspiring expanse of the galaxy.
