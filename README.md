
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scrolls of Al-Khazini.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, fording treacherous rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, the allure of Zerzura their only beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the corrosive effects of Xylos’ radiation were just some of the perils she faced.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested her skills and resolve as she pushed the boundaries of human exploration, driven by a thirst for knowledge and the unwavering pursuit of her mission.
