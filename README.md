
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Her journey from the bustling port of Marseilles to the fabled city of Constantinople is fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, from bartering for supplies in unfamiliar villages to navigating by the stars under the vast, indifferent sky.  But the lure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, fuels her onward, despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  The challenges are different, but no less daunting: navigating treacherous asteroid fields, repairing vital systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen, and facing the ever-present threat of pirates and unknown celestial phenomena.  Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, and unlocking the universe's secrets drives her and her crew relentlessly forward,  a modern-day odyssey among the stars.
