
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, was treacherous, a labyrinth of mud, fallen timber, and lurking shadows.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a sacred relic – felt as perilous as any dragon's hoard.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, all tested his courage and resilience. The journey was as much a test of faith as it was of endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research outpost on the far side of the galaxy, a journey taking years even at near-light speed.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars and the occasional meteor shower, was a constant reminder of the journey's isolation and the potential dangers lurking unseen: rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone vessels.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, fueled her onward.
