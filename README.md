
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, felt like a lead weight. This journey across the rugged spine of the kingdom wasn't merely a pilgrimage; it was a desperate race against time to reach the rumored healer in the distant valley, the only hope for her ailing brother. Each creaking step was a testament to her courage and a prayer for survival against the elements, bandits, and the ever-present shadow of famine.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla adjusted the chronometer on her wrist, the swirling nebulae of Xylos a breathtaking backdrop to the jump coordinates.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hummed with anticipation, poised for the intergalactic leap to the Kepler-186f system. This wasn't a simple trade run; this was a mission to establish first contact with a potentially sentient species, a voyage fraught with both excitement and the chilling unknown of the cosmos.  The vastness of space, a beautiful terror, dwarfed even her most daring dreams.
