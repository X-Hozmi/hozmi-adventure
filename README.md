Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in Eldoria's promise spurred them on, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted to the far-flung Kepler-186f.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's audacious reach into the cosmos.  Eva’s mission: to establish a new colony on a potentially habitable planet, a daunting task fraught with the dangers of unknown alien life and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction.  Yet, the vast expanse of space held a captivating beauty, and the knowledge that she was a pioneer in the exploration of the galaxy fueled her unwavering determination.
