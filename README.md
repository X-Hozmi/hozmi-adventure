
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the parched grass, held the potential for adventure – bandit ambushes, the unexpected kindness of strangers, the thrill of discovering a forgotten monastery nestled in a hidden valley. The journey to Damascus was perilous, a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder, testing her resilience and challenging her perceptions of the world beyond her village.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating nebulae painted across the cosmic canvas, she and her crew faced the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and unforeseen gravitational anomalies.  Each jump through hyperspace offered a glimpse of unimaginable beauty – celestial bodies ablaze with vibrant colours, swirling galaxies like cosmic whirlpools. The quest for the legendary Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a gamble, a perilous voyage into the uncharted territories of the universe.
