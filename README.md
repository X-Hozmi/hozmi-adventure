
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Dwynwen, had taken them through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over sun-baked plains.  Each day brought fresh peril – skirmishes with rogue knights, encounters with desperate villagers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promises of miraculous healing spurred them on, their determination a flickering flame against the vast, unforgiving backdrop of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by the expanding void of a dying star.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of black holes was a daily struggle.  The crew, a band of seasoned explorers, faced not just the physical dangers of interstellar travel but also the psychological strain of isolation and the creeping uncertainty of their chances of success. The vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy stretched before them, a testament to human ambition and the enduring allure of discovery.
