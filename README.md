
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – and peril – as bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend.  The journey was arduous, but the hope of healing spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Kaito piloted his starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking alien flora and potentially lethal predators.  Warp speed blurred the distance between galaxies, yet the thrill of the unknown, the challenge of charting unmapped territories in the cosmos, remained as potent a draw as it had been for medieval travelers navigating by the stars.  The adventure, though vastly different, held the same intoxicating blend of danger and discovery.
