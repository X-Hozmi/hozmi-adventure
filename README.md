
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and meager coins; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid to a far-off monastery rumored to possess a miraculous healing balm. Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the dense forest, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, yet the burning sun on her face and the distant chime of church bells spurred her onward.  Robbers, bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease were minor inconveniences compared to the potential salvation waiting at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* sliced through the nebula, its hyperdrive humming a song only a seasoned pilot could decipher.  Her mission: to deliver a precious cargo of xenobiological samples across the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey that would span decades in subjective time.  While the dangers of warp storms and pirate incursions were ever-present, the true challenge lay in the isolation, the weight of responsibility for her precious cargo and the vast unknown of the cosmos surrounding her.  The galaxy held its breath, waiting for her safe return.
