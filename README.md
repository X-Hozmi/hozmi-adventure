
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll—a map promising the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse; yet the hope of salvation spurred her onward, past crumbling castles and whispering forests, towards a destiny shrouded in both peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space held dangers unseen—rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of power—enough to sustain her people for generations— outweighed the risks, driving her deeper into the cosmic unknown, a lone voyager charting a course through the star-dusted tapestry of the galaxy.
