Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats and a chipped map, but her heart held the fire of a thousand journeys.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – of bandits, of forgotten castles, of whispered legends come to life. This was not a journey for comfort; it was a pilgrimage into the unknown, a test of her courage and resilience against the harsh realities of a medieval world.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes, unpredictable rips in space-time that could spit them out anywhere—or nowhere at all.  The thrill of exploration, of charting unmapped territories amidst the cosmic ocean, far outweighed the risks for Ryla and her crew, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a thirst for the extraordinary.
