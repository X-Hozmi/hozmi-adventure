
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Andalusia, the scent of rosemary and impending storm mixing in the air. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's sealed decree, a perilous mission to reach the far-off monastery of Sanctuario before winter's grip choked the passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and mortal danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the K'tharr homeworld, a civilization known for both advanced technology and unpredictable hostility.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the ruthless Kryll Empire, Rexx faced a different kind of peril, one measured not in leagues but in light-years, a battle fought not with swords and shields, but with wits, courage, and the cutting-edge technology of a far-flung future.
