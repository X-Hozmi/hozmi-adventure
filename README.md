
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onwards.  The sun beat down on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside, his small band of men a shadow against the endless fields of wheat.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Merlin. Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of disease lay between them and their goal, a journey promising both glory and a brutal, uncertain end.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a desperate scramble for shelter and safety.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the perils of hyperspace anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields, was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The crew, a diverse collection of explorers and scientists, faced not only the vast emptiness of space but also the unknown dangers lurking on the alien world they sought to colonize. The future of humanity, it seemed, hung on the success of their perilous voyage.
