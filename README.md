
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis promised in whispered tales, a destination worth risking bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation to reach. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or disaster.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a test of her spirit as much as her endurance.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  The thrill of discovery fueled her crew, a motley band united by their thirst for the unknown.  Ahead lay unmapped planets, potential new life forms, and the ever-present threat of celestial anomalies.  Each jump through hyperspace, each survey of a new world, was a leap into the breathtaking, and sometimes terrifying, wonders of the cosmos.
