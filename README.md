
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the chill bite of the Alps a stark contrast to the sun-baked plains she'd left behind.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it holds the hopes of her family, the promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands of the south.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the nearby forest, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road ahead fuel her relentless journey.  The medieval world is a tapestry woven with danger and beauty, and Elara, with her steely gaze and unwavering spirit, is determined to navigate its threads.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a comforting roar against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demand constant vigilance, but the lure of discovery, the potential for a new beginning for humanity amongst the stars, fuels his unwavering dedication. The future is a galaxy of untold possibilities, and Comet, at the helm of his ship, is charting its course.
