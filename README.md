
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun a relentless hammer on her back.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a whispered promise of a life beyond the barren plains of her homeland.  The rumors of a hidden monastery, nestled within the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Mountains, fueled her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.  She pressed on, driven by a hope as fierce as the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a tapestry of cosmic wonders and harrowing dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting a course to galaxies beyond human comprehension, spurred her onward.  The vastness of space held both immense peril and untold rewards.
