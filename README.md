
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and dark forests, each shadow whispering tales of bandits and wild beasts. His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril, but one that promised untold riches and glory, or perhaps, a swift and brutal end.  Every creak of saddle leather and rustle of leaves heightened the tension, transforming the simple act of travel into a constant dance with fate.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Each jump across hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies for the Sol Federation, searching for habitable planets and rare minerals.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of danger; the silent threat of rogue asteroids, the unpredictable behavior of wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile civilizations.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of light and darkness, held both immense promise and unimaginable peril.
