
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest, to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across scorching deserts, and into the shadowed depths of whispering forests. Each dawn brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the ravines, wild animals prowling under the moon, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches fueled his resolve, pushing him ever onward towards his unknown destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology beyond human comprehension.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and braving the unpredictable forces of hyperspace, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Their journey was measured not in leagues but in light-years, the scale of their adventure dwarfed only by the unimaginable wonders – and terrors – that lay waiting amongst the stars.
