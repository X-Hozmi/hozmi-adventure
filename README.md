
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a brutal test of endurance.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring rains, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, the lure of Jerusalem, the whispered promises of salvation and adventure, spurred him on. The whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten kingdoms fueled his determination to reach his destination, no matter the cost.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm against the thrumming engines.  Vast, uncharted galaxies stretched before her, each star a potential destination, a new world teeming with the unknown. The thrill of discovery overshadowed the ever-present danger of solar flares, asteroid fields, and the enigmatic alien species rumoured to inhabit the outer reaches.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and, if possible, forge a new alliance for humanity among the stars.
