
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of the unknown.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences in her quest to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the secrets to her family's lost fortune.  The journey was arduous, demanding both physical and mental fortitude, but the promise of adventure fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of his ship.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by hostile alien lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of cosmic wonders, but the dangers were equally immense – unpredictable gravitational fields, pirate attacks, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially lethal, phenomena in the vast expanse of space. The galaxy was his playground, but survival demanded constant vigilance and unwavering skill.
