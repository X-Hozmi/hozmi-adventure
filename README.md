
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whisper of magic and untold riches, fueled his determination, pushing him ever closer to his destiny, or perhaps, his doom.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through a nebula shimmering with iridescent gases. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling population of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, Elara, guided by her unwavering belief in humanity’s future, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the distant promise of a new home amongst the stars.
