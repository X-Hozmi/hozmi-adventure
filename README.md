
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Tuscan landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a worn map, promising riches and a legendary lost city nestled deep within the Apennine Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the treacherous mountain paths themselves stood between her and her ambition. The journey was arduous, but the thrill of the unknown spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor sentient life unlike any encountered before.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes,  Eva's crew faced the constant threat of cosmic radiation and the ever-present unknown of deep space.  The vastness of the cosmos held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, a testament to the boundless courage it took to push the frontiers of human exploration across the galaxy.
