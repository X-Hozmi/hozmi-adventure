
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and whispered legends, guided her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the fractured lands.  The hope of Eldoria, however, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through swirling nebulae and avoiding rogue asteroids was a daily challenge, a far cry from the simple dangers of medieval travel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess knowledge of faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a terrifying expanse; the potential for encountering unknown alien life, both benevolent and hostile, kept her crew on edge.  Yet, the lure of Xylos and its potential to change the course of interstellar civilization propelled them ever forward.
