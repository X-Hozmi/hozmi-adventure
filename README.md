
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a crumbling village and a vengeful lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, promises both peril and the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, storms, and the endless expanse of the land itself are her constant companions, testing her strength and resolve with every passing day.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma pilots the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours paint the bridge in breathtaking hues as her crew navigates treacherous asteroid fields and communicates with alien civilizations across unimaginable distances.  Their mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable planets and lost relics of a forgotten empire. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, holds its own dangers—cosmic radiation, hostile alien encounters, and the constant pressure of deep-space travel.  Yet, the promise of discovery fuels their every journey.
