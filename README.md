
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with days of relentless sun and nights of chilling rain.  He’d traded the familiar comfort of his village for the uncertain promise of salvation and adventure, sharing cramped inns with boisterous pilgrims and wary merchants, each encounter a potential story for the bards back home.  Robbers, disease, and the sheer vastness of the continent itself presented constant, gnawing threats.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The familiar hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comfort against the overwhelming scale of the journey; the vast, alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport a constant reminder of the dangers and wonders that lay ahead.  Unlike Thomas's journey across a single world, Eva’s encompassed entire galaxies, each jump a calculated risk, each arrival a breathtaking marvel in the face of the infinite.
