
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns – of exotic spices in faraway lands, of shimmering silks and powerful sultans.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King's representative in Constantinople, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and disease stalked the dusty roads, but the thought of the reward and the glory spurred him onward.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges and the hope of reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The ship, a sleek marvel of bio-engineered alloys, hummed with the energy of a thousand suns as it navigated the treacherous gravitational currents.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from Earth.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered both wonder and terror.  Cosmic storms threatened to shatter her vessel, and the alien lifeforms rumored to inhabit Kepler-186f were nothing short of legendary, but the lure of discovery burned brighter than any star.  The galaxy beckoned.
