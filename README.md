
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, barely legible after months of relentless sun and rain, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey, testing her courage and resourcefulness at every turn.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-earned victory, forging her into a seasoned adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of wormholes were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, spurred her on.  The search for Xylos was more than a mission; it was a testament to human ambition, a voyage into the unknown.
