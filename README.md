
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with herbs and dried meats.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life, a rumour that fueled her perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, a thirst for adventure burning brighter than the midday sun.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of breathtaking colours, the swirling gases a stark contrast to the cold, hard steel of her ship. Her mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unknown celestial phenomena.  Faster-than-light travel offered speed, but not safety; rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  But for Ryla, the vastness of space was a siren's call, a challenge to explore the ultimate frontier.
