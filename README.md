
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril.  Banditry was a constant threat, and the whispers of wild beasts in the dark forests kept her hand instinctively close to the hilt of her dagger.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, felt as distant and unreachable as the snow-capped peaks looming before her, a journey fueled by faith and the desperate hope for a cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The crimson dust of the nebula painted the viewport in hues of hellfire as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields, a far cry from the dangers of earthly travel.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a rogue planet, a task fraught with the potential for catastrophic equipment failure and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vast, inky black of space, while beautiful, held dangers just as formidable as any earthly wilderness.
