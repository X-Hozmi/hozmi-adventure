
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey to the Holy Land was proving far more treacherous than the tales had described.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the endless expanse of rolling hills offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing his strength, his faith, and his resolve in equal measure.  The whispered promise of salvation lay far ahead, obscured by the hardships of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the Andromeda galaxy was a delicate dance with gravity wells and unpredictable spacetime distortions.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, both terrified and exhilarated her.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward, a future free from conflict, fueled her determination.
