
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and sweating horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing fear of bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the unsettling whisper of the Black Death that stalks the land.  Yet, with every league we conquer, the allure of the fabled city of Constantinople, shimmering on the horizon of our ambition, grows stronger. The risks are immense, but the promise of silks, spices, and untold riches fuels our relentless westward push.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out the silence of interstellar space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a jewel orbiting a red dwarf light years from Earth.  The journey is a blur of calculated jumps across the void, punctuated by the tense moments of navigating asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic anomalies.  But the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life, the chance to unlock the universe's greatest mysteries, dwarfs the inherent dangers of this galactic odyssey. The unknown beckons, and we answer its call.
