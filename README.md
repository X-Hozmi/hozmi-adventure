
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He’d traded his meagre inheritance for a place on this caravan, bound for the fabled spice markets of the East.  Days bled into weeks, a kaleidoscope of sun-drenched vineyards, towering snow-capped mountains, and dusty plains teeming with bandits and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a weary sigh of relief, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of untold riches, kept him pushing forward, a tiny speck against the vast and unpredictable tapestry of the medieval world.

Conversely, centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in months of hyperspace travel, was punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the occasional emergency repair in zero gravity.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet unforgiving, held both immense peril and the tantalizing possibility of discovering new life, new resources, and a new home for humanity.  Eva's adventure lay not in bandits or disease, but in navigating asteroid fields, battling cosmic storms, and facing the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.
