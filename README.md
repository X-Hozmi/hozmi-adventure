
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the ravaged lands of Aquitaine was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and whispers of plague stalked the settlements she passed.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the hope of reaching her estranged brother in Avignon fueled her relentless trek, a beacon guiding her through the treacherous landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the crimson nebula, the swirling cosmic dust painting vibrant streaks across the viewport of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances and unpredictable gravitational currents still presented constant challenges.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos, but the potential discovery of a thriving civilization spurred Jax and her crew to brave the perils of interstellar travel.
