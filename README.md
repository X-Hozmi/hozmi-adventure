
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – the whispered legends of bandits lurking in the shadowed valleys, the promise of bustling marketplaces in distant cities, and the ever-present danger of disease and starvation.  We navigate by the stars and the sun, our progress measured in the agonizing slowness of camel's gait, yet every aching muscle and blistered foot is a testament to the grandeur of our journey across the heart of a vast and unpredictable world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle unfolding outside the viewport.  Nebulae swirl in vibrant hues, galaxies spiral into infinity, and the cold, sterile beauty of unexplored planets beckons. Each jump across the void is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the reward is the discovery of alien life, breathtaking landscapes, and the humbling vastness of the cosmos.  The future is not just a destination, but a boundless frontier waiting to be charted.
