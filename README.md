The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering mountains scraped the bruised sky, while deep ravines threatened to swallow man and beast whole.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone city, rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing Queen.

But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel for humanity, of opening up a new era of exploration, drove her and her crew to brave the unimaginable distances and potential dangers of the vast cosmos.
