
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a vengeful Baron.  Each day brought its own peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the promise of the fertile lands beyond the mountains, whispered tales of prosperity in distant Avignon, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star cruiser a tiny speck against the infinite tapestry of space. His mission: to locate the mythical Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Warp drives hummed, the stars streaking past like falling embers, as Jax charted a course through unmapped territories, facing down asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The journey was a gamble, but the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the universe – was a risk worth taking.
