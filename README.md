
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I pushed onward, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be home to mythical beasts and highwaymen more dangerous than any wolf.  My meager supplies – a pouch of dried meat, a waterskin, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between me and the unknown, as I journeyed to the distant city of Prague, seeking both fortune and escape from a life I could no longer endure.  Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, a testament to the raw, untamed power of the medieval world.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped to warp speed.  Orion's Belt, a familiar sight from countless voyages, blurred into a streak of vibrant colours. My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years away.  The risks were different now, less about bandits and more about navigating asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes. Yet the thrill remained, that same primal urge to explore the unknown, to push the boundaries of what was possible, echoing the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved the forests and mountains of old.
