
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains.  Her journey from the bustling port city of Venice to the fabled Silk Road markets of Samarkand was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching a new village, a chance for meager sustenance and whispered tales of other travelers, their own harrowing journeys weaving a tapestry of adventure and survival.  Yet, the allure of the East, of exotic spices and untold riches, kept her spirit alight.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of light against the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity. The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful expanse, held both promise and danger.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, uncharted asteroid fields lurked in the darkness, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, friend or foe, kept her on edge.  Yet,  the drive to discover, to push the boundaries of human exploration, fuelled her every action, making the perilous journey a thrilling adventure for the ages.
