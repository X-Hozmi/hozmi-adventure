
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry. Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the grueling rhythm of horse and foot travel.  They braved treacherous mountain passes, skirted lawless forests teeming with bandits, and relied on the meager hospitality of isolated villages.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their endurance, their faith, and their bond.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel had its risks – spatial distortions, unpredictable wormhole currents – but the allure of discovering new life, new worlds, outweighed the danger.  Eva and her crew navigated through asteroid fields, dodged space pirates, and repaired critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation. Their journey, a tapestry woven from scientific precision and gutsy improvisation, promised untold riches, or utter annihilation.
