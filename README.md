
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  This journey to the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the western sea, was a gamble – a desperate hope for a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers and wonders that awaited her across the treacherous landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold brilliance of distant stars, offered a different kind of adventure.  Instead of bandits and wild beasts, the dangers were cosmic – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning equipment.  But the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, spurred her onward, a beacon brighter than any earthly sun.
