
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than her goal: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled a mix of fear and fierce determination – a potent brew for a medieval adventurer.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful Zydonian patrol was child's play compared to the cosmic unknowns that lay ahead.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, held the same intoxicating allure as the medieval world, only this adventure spanned galaxies, not just kingdoms.
