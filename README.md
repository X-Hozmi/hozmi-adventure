
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone, had already claimed a mule and several frostbitten toes.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the silent awe of ancient forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-shifting sands of the desert – testing their courage, resilience, and the bonds of their fellowship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The journey was a relentless dance with gravity wells, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Weeks stretched into months aboard the cramped vessel, the crew battling cosmic radiation, equipment malfunctions, and the gnawing loneliness of deep space. Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding lost humanity, fueled their unwavering determination to reach their destination, no matter the cost.
