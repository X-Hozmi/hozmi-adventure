
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each winding turn held the promise of both breathtaking vistas and unforeseen danger – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, crumbling bridges threatening to send her plummeting into the churning river below, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her worn map, a patchwork of hastily scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the fabled city of Zaragoza, where whispered legends promised untold riches and a chance to escape her impoverished village.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfire" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent mineral from the uncharted planet of Aethel, a world whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast expanse of space held its own perils –  coronal mass ejections, pirate raiders, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel – but the allure of discovery far outweighed the risks for Ryla and her crew.
