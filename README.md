
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a snaking line of weary oxen and sweating men, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the restless spirits within our company. We're bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brings fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to etch our names into the annals of history, propels us forward.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highway.  The sleek, obsidian hull of the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky blackness of intergalactic space, its powerful engines a low hum against the silence. We are cartographers of the cosmos, charting nebulae and mapping the trajectories of uncharted planets.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unknowable expanse.  Alien landscapes, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly hostile, await our exploration, the ultimate test of courage and ingenuity against the unforgiving indifference of the universe.
