
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a ragged tapestry of  oxen, creaking wagons, and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing uncertainty of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the vast, unforgiving desert. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's opulence, its shimmering fountains and lost treasures, propel us onward, a testament to the human spirit's insatiable thirst for the unknown.  The journey is arduous, but the potential reward – a legend made real – fuels our every step.


Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  My starship, the 'Starseeker,' leaps across the void between galaxies, charting unknown nebulae and seeking out habitable worlds.  The dangers are different now – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering alien civilizations, some benevolent, others… not so much. But the thrill remains the same: the endless expanse of the cosmos, the promise of discovery, and the exhilarating challenge of pushing the boundaries of human exploration into the breathtaking and terrifying unknown.
