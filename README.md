
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of cosmic dust and distant starlight.  Her mission: to chart the planet's resources and establish a forward base, a small step in humanity's grand expansion across the cosmos.  Yet, even amidst the wonders of the galaxy, the ever-present dangers of hostile alien lifeforms and unpredictable celestial phenomena made every jump a breathtaking, perilous adventure.
