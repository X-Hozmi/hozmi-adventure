
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Elara, was proving far more perilous than anticipated. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, while the relentless sun baked the earth, turning every step into a test of endurance. Their meager supplies dwindled, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunting the shadowed mountains fueled their growing fear, yet the unwavering faith in their hearts, and the promise of salvation, drove them ever closer to their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns, Eva and her crew faced a constant battle against the unforgiving expanse of space.  The weight of responsibility, the knowledge that countless lives depended on her success,  and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel pressed heavily upon her, a stark contrast to the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos that stretched out before her.
