
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back.  The journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened landslides, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s enchanted jewels and forgotten magic spurred him onward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to face the unknown.  His loyal warhorse, his only companion, shared the burden of the arduous trek.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days, but in stardates, each punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional meteor shower.  While lacking the immediate dangers of bandits and starvation, the vastness of space presented its own threats – unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding human knowledge, fueled her unwavering resolve.
