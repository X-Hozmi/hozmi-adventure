
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre landscape of Provence in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, the gnawing hunger of empty stomachs, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the whispered tales of miracles and ancient wonders fueling her weary steps. Each passing village, each unfamiliar face, held the promise of a new story, a new challenge, a new adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  He'd traded medieval perils for the dangers of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  His quest wasn't for religious salvation, but for a lost artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with celestial wonders and unimaginable horrors, held the same allure as Elara's medieval world – a boundless expanse brimming with mysteries to unravel, challenges to overcome, and adventures waiting to be written in the annals of galactic history.
