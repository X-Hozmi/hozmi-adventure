
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks piercing a sky the color of bruised plums.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried rations and a chipped map, a lifeline in a land rife with brigands and unpredictable weather.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown; the whispered tales of the fabled city of Zerzura, a jewel hidden in the heart of the desert, fueled her onward. This journey, fraught with peril, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors painting the cockpit in a kaleidoscope of cosmic wonder.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold secrets older than Earth itself.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  Yet, for Eva, the vastness of space held an irresistible allure, a promise of discovery that eclipsed any fear.
