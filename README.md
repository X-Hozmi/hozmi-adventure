
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that tested her resolve more than any beast. Yet, the whispered stories of Ys, the shimmering promise of healing, spurred her on, a flickering beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  But the faint hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the mystery of Nova Terra's disappearance, fueled her determination, a guiding star in the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
