
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the splintered kingdoms. Every sunrise brought new challenges, every sunset the gnawing fear of failure. Yet, the hope fueling his journey burned brighter than any campfire.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of shimmering amethyst.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien maps tested her skills and courage.  The vast emptiness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held the key to finding a lost civilization and forging a new destiny for humanity amongst the stars.
