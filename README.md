
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged terrain in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was far from over; rumors of a hidden monastery holding ancient knowledge fueled her relentless trek.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers – and rewards – that lay ahead.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements were her constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable space storms was commonplace; the vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  The weight of the galaxy rested on her shoulders, yet the possibility of discovery, of rewriting the rules of interstellar travel, fueled her unwavering resolve.
