
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of Zerzura, spurred him on, a flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, flung across a gulf of unimaginable distance.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and battling the ever-present threat of space pirates, Eva and her crew faced perils far exceeding those of any medieval journey.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of allure – the promise of new worlds, new civilizations, and the thrilling unknown.
