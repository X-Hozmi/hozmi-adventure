
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Alexandria, a pilgrimage to find a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling into the chasm below, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any highwayman.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a potent elixir against despair.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his cockpit. His mission: to deliver vital terraforming microbes to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The journey was measured in lightyears, not leagues, and the dangers were far more cosmic – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on vulnerable freighters.  But for Rexx, the vastness of space offered a freedom and adventure that dwarfed even the most daring medieval explorations, a chance to leave his mark on the tapestry of the cosmos.
