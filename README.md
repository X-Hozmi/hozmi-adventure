
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her face.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Her worn leather satchel contains little more than dried meat, a worn map, and a desperate hope – a hope fueled by whispers of untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustling of the nearby forest, is a potential threat in this untamed landscape, but the thrill of the unknown spurs her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Signals crackle from the helm, detailing the treacherous asteroid field ahead – a perilous shortcut to the Xylos Prime system, a gamble worth taking to reach the fabled Kryll crystals.  The vastness of space, the alien wonders beyond human comprehension, and the constant hum of the ship's engines create an exhilarating, lonely symphony.  Her mission is vital, her crew reliant on her courage – the future of interstellar trade hangs in the balance.
