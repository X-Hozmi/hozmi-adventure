
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn surcoats flapping behind them. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of their saddles, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, or worse. The journey was arduous, their supplies dwindling, but the hope of salvation fuelled their weary steps across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the crippling loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the risk.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, the galaxy a far more dangerous, yet potentially far more rewarding, landscape to traverse.
