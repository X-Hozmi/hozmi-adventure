
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of wheat a fiery orange.  Her journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the very air seemed thick with the foreboding of the Black Death's shadow. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed hope, the promise of a new day and a closer approach to her destination, fueling her adventurous spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours against the inky blackness of space. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds. The dangers were different now – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  But the thrill of discovery, the sheer immensity of space, spurred her on, a modern-day adventurer navigating a cosmos teeming with untold wonders and challenges.
