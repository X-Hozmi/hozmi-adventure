
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each creaking cart wheel, each wary glance at the darkening forest, fueled the adrenaline of their journey – a perilous gamble against fate, bandits, and the relentless advance of disease.  The road was their only hope, stretching endlessly before them, a ribbon of uncertain destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was commonplace, the thrill of exploration tempered by the weight of responsibility for her crew.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic wonders, presented challenges far exceeding any medieval road, but the promise of a new beginning, a chance to forge a future among the stars, made it a voyage worth undertaking.
