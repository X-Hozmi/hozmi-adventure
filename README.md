
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred them onward, their resolve tested by the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainty of their journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low, insistent thrum.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human civilization.  Vast nebulae painted the blackness with breathtaking colours, while the chilling emptiness of space constantly reminded her of the inherent risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards – the discovery of new worlds, new life – were a siren song too powerful to resist.
