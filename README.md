
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, a renewed determination fueled her onward, the promise of spiritual solace and the thrill of the unknown outweighing the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the dangers were no less real: unpredictable wormhole currents, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile alien species.  The vastness of the galaxy, a breathtaking tapestry of vibrant stars and swirling gas clouds, held both wonder and peril in equal measure, a constant reminder of the immense risks and equally immense rewards of interstellar exploration.
