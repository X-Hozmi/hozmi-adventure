
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of a distant city barely visible through the shimmering heat.  Her journey across the fractured kingdom has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, with its rumored healing springs and forgotten magic, fuel her weary steps. The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and rain, is her only guide through the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unpredictable cosmos.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and potentially hostile alien life – the thrill of exploration, the yearning to discover the unknown, echoes the spirit of those medieval adventurers who dared to brave the unknown lands of their time.
