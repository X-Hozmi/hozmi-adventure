
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired mare onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than the distant, shimmering spires of the city in his dreams.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – negotiating with suspicious villagers, bartering for meager provisions, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger, the thrill of survival intertwining with the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula aboard the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic storms and rogue asteroids; instead of disease, the insidious threat of hull breaches and system failures.  The vast, inky blackness of space offered a breathtaking spectacle, but it also whispered of loneliness and the terrifying unknown. The thrill of exploration, the discovery of new worlds and civilizations, fueled her relentless journey across the galactic expanse.
