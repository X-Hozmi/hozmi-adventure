
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to the wind. Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the King of Aragon, pushed her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked plains, her heart a drumbeat against the rhythm of the mule's hooves.  Every fleeting glimpse of a distant settlement offered a fragile promise of safety, a momentary respite from the ever-present threat.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the peril of unknown celestial phenomena and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was routine; the true challenge was the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, the vast emptiness punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the silent, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos.
