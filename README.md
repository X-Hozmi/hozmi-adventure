
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the pale sun, spurred his destrier onward, the rough cobblestones jarring his bones.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by mythical beasts and brigands more dangerous still.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Eldoria, to deliver a vital message that could determine the fate of his own.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, peril, and perhaps, glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien riddles were all in a day's work for Elara and her crew. The vastness of space held untold wonders, but also dangers far beyond the imagination of any medieval knight.
