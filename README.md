
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He shared meager rations with his companions, a grizzled veteran and a young, eager squire, their hopes as high as the jagged peaks surrounding them, their resolve tested by the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unknown dangers.  Alien life forms, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders filled her days.  Her crew, a diverse team of navigators, engineers, and xeno-linguists, faced the vast emptiness of space with courage and unwavering scientific curiosity, united by their shared pursuit of knowledge and the thrill of exploring the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
