
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map – a route whispered to lead to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits lurked in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her courage, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every sunrise.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother's recovery fueled her onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge and every star a silent guide in the vast, unknowable night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope flickering weakly across light-years of space.  Asteroids whizzed past, the ship's shields shimmering in defense, and the relentless void pressed in on all sides.   But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, held firm.  The weight of the colony's fate rested on her shoulders, a responsibility heavier than any star, but the unwavering loyalty to her crew and the promise of survival pushed her to navigate the cosmic ocean, towards a distant, uncertain shore.
