
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara, her worn leather satchel bouncing against her hip, urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled her nostrils, a stark contrast to the opulent silks and spices of the Sultan's court she'd left behind.  Her quest, a perilous journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains to deliver a vital message to the King, was fraught with danger.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony on the fringes of known space.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was a constant negotiation with the capricious whims of hyperspace, demanding precise calculations and unwavering focus.  The vast, star-dusted canvas outside her cockpit window held both the promise of discovery and the terrifying expanse of the unknown, a constant reminder of the breathtaking scale of interstellar travel in the 27th century.
