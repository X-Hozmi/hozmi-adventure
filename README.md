Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the glint of the sun on a distant peak fueled her onward, a beacon of hope in a landscape both unforgiving and breathtakingly beautiful. Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath, was a testament to her courage and unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the unknown. The alien flora and fauna of Kepler-186f held the promise of scientific breakthroughs, but also the risk of encountering unforeseen dangers.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, pressed in on her, reminding her of the incredible fragility of life – and the boundless courage required to explore it.
