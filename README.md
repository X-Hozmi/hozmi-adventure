
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onwards, the relentless sun beating down on their backs.  Dust billowed behind their horses, obscuring the already indistinct trail leading through the unforgiving, sun-baked landscape.  Each day brought fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their quest, a legendary lost city rumored to hold untold riches, felt increasingly elusive with every passing mile, yet the lure of adventure and the hope of glory spurred them onward.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents of space was child's play compared to the political intrigue that plagued their mission – a clandestine trade deal with a reclusive alien race.  The vastness of the cosmos, a tapestry woven with shimmering gas giants and distant, uncharted galaxies, was breathtaking but also isolating.  The weight of responsibility, the lives of her crew depending on her judgment, was a burden she carried with quiet resolve, her eyes fixed on the distant, shimmering promise of Xylos.
