The trail, a barely-there track through the unforgiving Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting flies and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a stark reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next bend. His quest – to reach the legendary city of Eldoria and retrieve the stolen Sunstone – felt more daunting with every mile.  He pressed on, fuelled by duty and a desperate hope for a successful return.


Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

The thought of the alien artifacts they sought – potentially capable of altering the fate of entire civilizations – kept her focused amidst the endless expanse of space and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.
