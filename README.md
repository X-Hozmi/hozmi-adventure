
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France.  Her worn leather satchel, containing a map more faded than her hopes, held the only clue to her brother's fate.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumour in a smoky tavern fueled her journey.  She faced bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the unwavering determination in her eyes burned brighter than the midday sun, spurred by the promise of reunion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a remote research outpost on the icy planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems amidst the relentless hum of the warp drive were all in a day’s work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, mirrored the vastness of her courage as she pushed the boundaries of human exploration.
