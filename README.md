
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping at her cloak.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of its shimmering spires and untold riches fueled her onward, each hardship a step closer to the legendary oasis.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and grime, was her only guide across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, leaving behind the familiar swirl of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigation across interstellar distances was a dance with gravity wells and wormholes, a delicate ballet requiring both skill and courage. Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. But the promise of new worlds, of alien civilizations and untold discoveries, spurred Ryla and her crew onwards, their ship a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
