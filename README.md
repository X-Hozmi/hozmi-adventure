The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's illness – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the heart of bandit territory.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a renewed sense of determination to reach his goal, no matter the cost.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace were routine, but the unknown dangers of a new world – potentially hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable weather patterns, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction – kept her senses sharp. The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying peril, yet the allure of discovery fueled her journey.
