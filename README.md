
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-choked path, the stench of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Our quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality. Each day brought new perils; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatening to send us tumbling to our deaths, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of discovery, spurred us onward, our resolve hardened by shared hardship and the unwavering belief in our goal.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  The crimson dust of Mars swirled beneath the sleek hull of our starship as we charted a course for the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, a haven whispered about in ancient galactic lore, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Facing the vast, uncaring expanse of space – the threat of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations –  paled in comparison to the exhilarating prospect of reaching the edge of the known universe and unlocking its deepest mysteries.
