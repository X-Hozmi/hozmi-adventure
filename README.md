
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows that danced with the fear in her heart.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the dangers lurking in the wilderness – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the desperate hope for her brother's survival fueled her onward, pushing her further into the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its iridescent hues a stark contrast to the cold steel of his starship. His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the Xylos system, a journey across lightyears of treacherous space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate patrols, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day's work.  The galaxy held countless wonders and horrors, but the thrill of the chase and the promise of untold riches kept Razor pushing the limits of space exploration.
