
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her loyal hound, Barnaby, panting at her heels.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for a rare herb said to cure the plague ravaging the kingdom, burns in her saddlebag.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse – the plague itself.  Her journey is a tapestry woven with the threads of hope and fear, a testament to the courage needed to traverse a medieval world fraught with peril and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Krya, a journey fraught with its own unique dangers – treacherous asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from any known civilization.  The vastness of space is both breathtaking and terrifying, a stark contrast to the medieval landscapes of her ancestors, but the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of a seemingly impossible goal, remains the same.
