
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of her saddle leather was a counterpoint to the rhythmic beat of her weary heart.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were her constant companions, yet the unwavering hope of reaching Ys fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.  Every sunrise brought renewed determination, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit facing unimaginable hardship.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The ship’s AI, a soothing female voice, announced the jump to Kepler-186f, a planet promising rich mineral deposits.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders was all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew.  The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and deadly peril, constantly tested their skills and courage,  yet the allure of new discoveries and the promise of untold riches propelled them across the galaxy, pioneers in a relentless pursuit of the unknown.
