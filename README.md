
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d left his village months ago, a simple cartographer seeking the lost city of Zerzura, whispered to exist in the heart of the unforgiving Sahara.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, scorching heat threatening delirium, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown. Yet, the lure of the legendary city, of untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred him on, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship *Stardust*, the nebula of Xylos shimmering outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey across the galaxy was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any support. But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the uncharted, pressed on, driven by the same audacious spirit that had propelled countless adventurers before her, only hers was a journey among the stars.
