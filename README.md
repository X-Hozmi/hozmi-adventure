
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them across treacherous mountain passes, through dark forests teeming with bandits, and across rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each sunrise brought new challenges –  negotiating with suspicious villagers, foraging for meager meals, and constantly scanning the horizon for any sign of danger.  The weight of their packs, and the even heavier burden of their quest, seemed to grow with every league.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with its own perils:  uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, filled Elara with a sense of awe that rivaled the most breathtaking earthly landscape. Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a beacon of hope in the vast cosmic ocean.
