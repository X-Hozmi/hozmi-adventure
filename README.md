
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Montsegur, felt as endless as the horizon itself.  Bandit patrols, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the perils of the medieval world.  He pressed on, driven by duty and a flicker of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were routine, yet the dangers of uncharted space – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks – tested her skills and courage.  The universe was vast and unforgiving, but the promise of discovery propelled her onward.
