
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-choked track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the overgrown verge, sent a shiver of apprehension through us.  Our quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold secrets lost to time.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease tested our mettle as we pressed onward, fueled by ambition and the hope of untold riches.


Millennia later, the stars themselves were our highway. The crimson nebula of Cygnus X-1 painted the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter* as we navigated the treacherous currents of hyperspace.  Our mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential cradle of life light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reminder of our fragile place within the vast cosmic ocean.  Alien encounters, equipment malfunctions, and the crushing weight of interstellar loneliness were but a few challenges on our perilous journey into the unknown.
