
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the dry undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the spectral hounds that haunted these desolate lands kept her ever vigilant, her heart a drum against her ribs.  The journey was perilous, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula shimmering with a thousand dying suns. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Alien encounters were a constant threat – some friendly, some decidedly not.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to the boundless unknown and the courage required to explore its mysteries.
