
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the towering peaks, and the unforgiving terrain tested her strength and resilience at every turn.  Each creak of her saddle, each thunderclap echoing across the valley, fueled both her fear and her unwavering determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a signal their only guide through the uncharted expanse.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Eva and her crew faced the vastness of space, a journey far more perilous than any medieval quest, yet fuelled by the same unwavering hope for discovery and the promise of something extraordinary.
