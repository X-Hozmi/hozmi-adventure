
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope that Eldoria, with its promised salvation, lay just a day’s ride further.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to a faster-than-light drive.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate vessels was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable currents of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies. Each jump across the galaxy brought her closer to the elusive colony, and with every passing star, her determination to find Kepler-186f and bring its secrets back to the Federation only grew stronger.
