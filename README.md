
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new vista of rugged mountains, dense forests teeming with unseen dangers, and bustling market towns offering fleeting respite.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, storms threatened to swallow him whole, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any brigand. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, the whispered promise of the impossible, pushed him ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between days and weeks, but the cosmic expanse held its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unknowable darkness. But the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning, burned brighter than any star.
