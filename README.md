
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  Yet, the hope of saving her people fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any star.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders and lurking dangers, pressed in on him.  Asteroids, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies – all were risks in his quest for a future where the galaxy was truly within reach.
