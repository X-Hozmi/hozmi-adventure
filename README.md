
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – the last of a rare herb rumored to cure the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a jolt of fear through her, but the thought of her people spurred her onward.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable terrain were all threats as real as the creeping shadow of death itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a jewel shimmering amidst a billion stars.  But the galaxy held dangers far beyond the rocky terrain of medieval times: pirate fleets, sentient space storms, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien lifeforms.  The journey was a race against time, a desperate gamble against the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space.
