
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Seraphina, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by whispered tales of miraculous healing, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast and brutal beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the Andromeda galaxy.  The mission: to retrieve a vital energy source needed to sustain her colony.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking majesty of celestial bodies, hid equally breathtaking dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the fate of her people rested on her shoulders, and the endless expanse of the cosmos held both immense peril and untold reward.
