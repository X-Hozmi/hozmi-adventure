
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and grey stone villages.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and disease stalked the dusty roads. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the promise of reaching her destination fuelled her onward, each sunrise a fresh chapter in her grand adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony was a daily challenge, but the allure of discovering a new habitable planet, potentially teeming with alien life, eclipsed all risks.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, shrinking galaxies into manageable distances, but the solitude of space, the weight of responsibility, and the ever-present threat of unknown dangers were the true measure of this galactic odyssey.
