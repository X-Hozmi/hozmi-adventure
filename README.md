
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous; towering castles loomed on distant hills, while bandits lurked in the shadowy forests.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality, a journey fraught with the dangers of unpredictable weather, hostile lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the fragile hope of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and nebulous clouds, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and ensuring the ship's delicate systems functioned flawlessly were just some of the obstacles in her path.  The reward?  The chance to discover a new home for humanity, a legacy etched amongst the constellations.
