
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of exotic spices and silks that fueled his journey eastward.  Each creak of the saddle, each ford of a rushing river, was a step closer to the legendary city of Samarkand, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, a place he hoped held both fortune and escape from the crushing poverty of his village.  Bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on his perilous trek.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted across her viewport were a breathtaking distraction from the complex calculations required to navigate the treacherous gravitational pull of a nearby neutron star.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unknown space.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a heavy burden, but the promise of discovery, of contact with a long-lost human settlement, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting the vast, uncharted territories of the cosmos.
