
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of windswept hills and ominous forests. His quest, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold miraculous healing powers, had already tested his endurance and resourcefulness. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies were constant threats, each sunrise presenting a new challenge in this unpredictable land.  He carried with him not only his meager possessions, but the weight of hope, and the burning desire to reach his destination before winter's harsh grip claimed him.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through Captain Eva Rostova's bones.  She stared out at the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars, as they jumped across the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from a remote mining outpost, a solitary speck of light in this immense, breathtaking expanse.  The dangers here weren't bandits or blizzards, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any rescue.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the sheer scale of the universe, fueled her determination, making even the most daunting challenges feel worthwhile.
