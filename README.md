
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled their weary steps, the promise of spiritual solace and the camaraderie of shared hardship binding them together against the vastness of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  The ship’s AI, HALIX, hummed a low warning as they navigated treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on them, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the immensity of the cosmos. But the thrill of discovery, the potential for new worlds and untold knowledge, spurred them onwards.
