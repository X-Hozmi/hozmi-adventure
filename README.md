
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights crested the ridge, the unforgiving sun beating down on their worn surcoats. Before them stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and dark forests promising both bounty and peril. Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of the monastery, and perhaps even survival, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth and shrouded in mystery.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel were routine hazards on the galactic frontier. The true danger, however, lay in the unknown: the planet's volatile atmosphere, the potential for hostile alien life, and the lingering questions about what happened to the previous expeditions.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, both offered untold wonders and posed an unending array of challenges.
