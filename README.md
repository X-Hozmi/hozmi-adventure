
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights spurred their mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic capable of ending the devastating plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, pushed them relentlessly forward, their journey a desperate gamble against the grim backdrop of a dying world.


Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, presumed destroyed decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, uncharted celestial phenomena were merely the expected hazards.  The true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, a realm where the fabric of reality frayed at the edges, threatening to swallow her vessel whole.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to the colony's fate – or her own.
