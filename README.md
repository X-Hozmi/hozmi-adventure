
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the harsh reality of the journey; a constant battle against the unforgiving landscape and the gnawing uncertainties that plagued his every step towards the unknown.

Millennia later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human colonies scattered across the cosmos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravitational pulls of dying stars was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and resource scarcity that threatened the survival of her people.  Each jump through hyperspace brought her closer to a possible future, a future dependent on her ability to find a new Eden amongst the infinite darkness of space.
