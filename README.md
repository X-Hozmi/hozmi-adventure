
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's steed as he urged the animal onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of ancient forests teeming with both wild beasts and thieving brigands. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each nightfall a gamble against the elements and the unseen dangers that lurked in the dark.  His loyal sword and even more loyal companions were his only certainties on this perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian Crystal, a source of limitless energy said to exist on a remote planet orbiting a dying star.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and repairing the ship's hyperdrive after a near-fatal encounter with a space kraken were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also terrifyingly lonely. The galaxy held both unimaginable wonders and equally unimaginable threats, and Eva, with her seasoned crew, was ready to face them all for the sake of their mission's success.
