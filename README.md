
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-slicked back, urged his weary mount onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track winding through the unforgiving French countryside.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creaking step of his horse, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the disease itself.  He carried the weight of hope, and the burden of his people, on his broad shoulders.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant holographic display charting their course.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a rhythmic counterpoint to the silent vastness.  Her mission: to seek new life and new civilizations, carrying humanity's hopes for a future beyond a dying Earth.
