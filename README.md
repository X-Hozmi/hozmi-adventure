He’d crossed treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and bartered with suspicious villagers for meager sustenance.  His quest, to find the lost city of Eldoria and the legendary Sunstone, pushed him ever forward, despite the aching muscles and gnawing hunger. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, a renewed determination to overcome the obstacles strewn across the medieval landscape.
