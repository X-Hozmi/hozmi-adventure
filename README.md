
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's band of knights crested the windswept hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange. Their journey to reclaim the stolen relic of St. Fiacre was far from over; weeks of relentless travel lay ahead, fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter.  Each creak of their worn saddles, each strained muscle, was a testament to the arduous undertaking, a physical and spiritual test of their devotion and courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents and dodging asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political intrigue and potential alien encounters that awaited them on the far side of the galaxy.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the monumental risks and potential rewards of their interstellar voyage.
