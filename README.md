
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and meager rations, bounced against her ribs, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her companions on this pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Lourdes – a journey dictated by faith and fueled by desperation for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both salvation and doom.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' stood on the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vast, swirling nebula of the Andromeda Galaxy a breathtaking spectacle outside the viewport.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped sectors, searching for a legendary lost colony rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  But the thrill of discovery, the relentless pull of the unknown, remained a constant, echoing the spirit of those medieval pilgrims who had braved dangers of their own time.
