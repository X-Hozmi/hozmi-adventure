
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched earth, the relentless sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, led her through treacherous mountain passes, across unforgiving deserts, and into the shadowed forests where brigands lurked. Each sunrise brought new challenges – hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the hope of healing fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula, her starship a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colonized world of Xylos, stranded after a devastating solar flare.  The journey spanned light years, each jump a gamble against unpredictable space anomalies and the ever-present risk of pirate attacks.  But the weight of responsibility, and the knowledge that Xylos's survival rested on her shoulders, propelled Ryla across the galactic expanse, a solitary voyager charting her course through the inky black.
