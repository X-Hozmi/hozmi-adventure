
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the next rise, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon. His quest – to deliver the King's ransom to the besieged city of Aloria – had tested his mettle far beyond the jousting field.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the gnawing hunger of the long road had all conspired against him, yet the glint of Aloria's towers spurred him onward.  The whispered legends of dragons and sorcerers, once dismissed as fanciful tales, now seemed strangely plausible in this desolate, untamed landscape.


Centuries hence, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vastness of space, a glittering tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Weeks bled into months as the hyperdrive hummed, the ship a tiny speck against the infinite canvas.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  The challenges were not bandits or blizzards, but cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters – a far more perilous journey than any medieval knight could ever imagine.
