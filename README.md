
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Iberian Peninsula stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and a waterskin; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing herbs.  Each rocky pass, each whispering forest, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or simply the crushing weight of unforgiving terrain, but the whispered promise of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a burgeoning human colony.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating; each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each new planet a potential haven or deadly trap.  The weight of responsibility for her crew, and the future of humanity, rested heavily on her shoulders, yet the thrill of discovery outweighed the fear, a constant reminder of the boundless potential awaiting those brave enough to reach for the stars.
