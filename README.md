
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the biting wind whipping at her worn cloak.  Her journey across the ravaged lands of Francia was far from the chivalrous quests sung by bards; it was a brutal scramble for survival.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and disease, yet the unwavering glint of hope in her eyes reflected the unshakeable determination to reach the rumored monastery holding the cure for her ailing brother.  The vast, untamed landscape tested her strength and spirit, offering glimpses of breathtaking beauty amidst its harsh realities.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering strange, alien life forms were all in a day’s work for this seasoned galactic explorer. The breathtaking vistas of distant galaxies and the thrill of charting unmapped territories fueled her insatiable thirst for adventure, a legacy inherited from generations of spacefaring pioneers who dared to venture beyond the known cosmos.
