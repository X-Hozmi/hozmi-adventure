
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous river crossing, brought her closer to her goal, but also closer to the dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The journey was arduous, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Ahead, a swirling nebula painted the void in breathtaking hues, a far cry from the dusty plains of old Earth. His mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated humanity.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any rescue.  The vastness of space was terrifying, but the future of his species depended on his continued exploration.
