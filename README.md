
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's future, a desperate journey to escape the encroaching Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and discovery – bandits, storms, and the ever-present fear of the unseen plague itself. The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, tested her spirit and forged her resolve with every league covered.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by breathtaking cosmic wonders and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and unknown alien encounters, demanded precision, courage, and a deep understanding of the cosmos. Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking unknown.
