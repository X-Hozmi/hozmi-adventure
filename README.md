
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of hope, fueled by her brother's frail breaths, pushed her onward, her determination a shield against the relentless hardships of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s swirling colours. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable cosmic wonders.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering bizarre alien lifeforms, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies were just a few of the hazards she faced. Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of charting new territories for humankind, fueled her crew’s courage and pushed them further into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
