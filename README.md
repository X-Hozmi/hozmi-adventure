
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as he spurred his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested his courage and resilience. Each sunrise brought the chilling certainty that failure meant not just personal ruin but the death of countless others. His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, hope, and the unwavering pursuit of a desperate gamble.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a remote planet, a prize coveted by both her own struggling colony and a hostile galactic empire.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the constant threat of solar flares became routine challenges in her high-stakes voyage. The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful expanse, stretched before her – each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
