
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the glint of the distant oasis, promising water and perhaps salvation, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a medieval adventurer against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive were the daily realities of her life.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of stars and cosmic wonders, dwarfed even the most daunting terrestrial challenges, but the lure of discovery and the unwavering hope of bringing back a precious resource pushed her crew further into the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
