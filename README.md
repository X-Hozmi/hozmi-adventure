
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a rumored hidden monastery, said to hold the secrets of forgotten alchemy.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or the wrath of nature.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of adventure on the wind, propelled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily occurrence.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and terrifying peril, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the immense risks and potential rewards of her daring journey across the galaxy.
