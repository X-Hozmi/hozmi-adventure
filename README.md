
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Gold, a shimmering mirage whispered about in smoky taverns and hushed conversations.  His journey had already taken him through blighted forests haunted by brigands, across sun-baked plains where the heat shimmered like a fever dream, and over treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the wind howled like a banshee. Each sunrise brought a new peril, each sunset the bittersweet solace of a meager fire and a hard-earned rest.  He travelled not for glory, but for survival, and the desperate hope of a better life.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth. The journey was a tapestry woven from the hum of hyperdrive engines, the subtle shifts of gravitational forces, and the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of space-borne anomalies.   The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced challenges far removed from medieval hardships;  engine malfunctions, alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation all tested their courage and skill. Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of new worlds, fuelled their relentless pursuit of the unknown.
