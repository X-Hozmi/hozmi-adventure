
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of both peril and adventure.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself threatened to end his journey before it reached its climax.  He carried only a meager supply of food, his faith, and a worn map, his destiny hanging precariously in the balance.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal having been detected after centuries of silence.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a different kind of wilderness.  Instead of bandits, she faced the dangers of solar flares, asteroid fields, and the unknown unknowns of unexplored galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, depended on her skill and courage to navigate the treacherous currents of interstellar travel.
