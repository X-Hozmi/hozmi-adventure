
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a chipped map, a half-eaten loaf, and the hope of finding her estranged brother in the faraway city of Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of reunion, spurred her onward, a solitary adventurer against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of distant suns was child's play compared to the political intrigue and potential for intergalactic conflict that lay ahead.  Yet, the vastness of space, the mystery of the lost colony, and the chance to discover something new fueled her determination, making every light-year traversed a thrilling step into the unknown.
