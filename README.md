
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights crested the hill.  Their journey to the Sultan's court, a perilous trek across war-torn lands, had already claimed two men to fever and bandits another.  Each day brought fresh challenges: fording swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of lurking brigands.  Yet, the promise of glory, and perhaps even a king's ransom, spurred them onward, their battered armor gleaming faintly in the pallid sunlight.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Starseeker*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as they navigated the treacherous currents of spacetime, their destination a distant nebula rumored to hold a powerful, alien artifact.  Facing cosmic radiation storms and the ever-present threat of pirates – ruthless spacefaring gangs – demanded skill, courage, and the latest in navigational technology.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched endlessly before them.
