
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming dully in the weak sunlight, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another league conquered. Yet the whispered legends of Eldoria’s shimmering spires and potent magic fueled his resolve, pushing him ever closer to his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out the viewport of her starship, the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy a breathtaking spectacle.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Cygnus Arm, searching for habitable planets for a desperately overcrowded Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, fraught with the potential for spatial distortions and encounters with unpredictable alien lifeforms.  But the vast emptiness of space held a different kind of allure, a thrilling gamble against the infinite, fueled by the hope of finding a new dawn for humanity.
