
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her mule, burdened with meager supplies, plodded onward.  Each day was a gamble – bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked the ancient roads.  Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for her ailing brother, fueled her relentless journey, pushing her forward despite the hardship and uncertainty.  The adventure was perilous, but the potential reward was worth the risk.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' stared out from the bridge of the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' nebulae swirling around them in a breathtaking cosmic ballet. Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with its own dangers; treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships. Yet, the lure of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting the unmapped reaches of space, was a siren's call she couldn't resist.  The vastness of the cosmos offered unlimited adventure, a thrilling and terrifying prospect all at once.
