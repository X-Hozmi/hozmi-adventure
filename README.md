
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his chainmail rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large. Each sunrise brought new challenges, yet the hope of salvation fueled his relentless advance across the rugged, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course charted for Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a jarring experience, a blinding flash followed by the comforting hum of the Alcubierre drive.  Her mission: to establish a colony on this potentially habitable exoplanet.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers; unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders shadowed their path.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to forge a future among the stars, outweighed the risks, driving her and her crew ever closer to their destination.
