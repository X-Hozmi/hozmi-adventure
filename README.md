
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's urgent missive, a perilous journey to deliver a vital message to Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the relentless sun beat down mercilessly. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both danger and discovery.  The path ahead was fraught with hardship, but the weight of her responsibility spurred her onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable cosmic phenomena and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations.  The vast emptiness of space was as isolating as the most desolate medieval plain, yet the promise of breathtaking discoveries and the thrill of pushing human boundaries made the loneliness worthwhile.  The cosmos was her battlefield, the stars her guideposts.
