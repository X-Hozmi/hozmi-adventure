
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d traded his family’s meager harvest for passage to the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the endless expanse of steppe offered little comfort against the relentless sun and freezing nights.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the knowledge that the road stretched before him, impossibly long and fraught with unseen dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years away from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable fabric of spacetime. The vast emptiness of space, beautiful but unforgiving, amplified the isolation and the immense weight of her responsibility.  The thrill of exploration, however, outweighed every fear.
