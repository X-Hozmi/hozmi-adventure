
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Their journey from Canterbury to Rome was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes, bustling market towns offering fleeting respite, and whispered tales of legendary relics and forgotten kingdoms that spurred her onwards. The path was arduous, but the adventure fueled her spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were commonplace hazards.  But the vast, breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the thrill of discovering new worlds far outweighed the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a testament to human courage and the enduring allure of exploration.
