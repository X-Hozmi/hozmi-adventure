
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of the Black Death chilled her more than the autumn air.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary mile, represented a step closer to her destination, but also a step further from the safety of her home, a gamble with fate itself played out against the backdrop of a medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the risk of encountering uncharted stellar phenomena or hostile alien races a constant shadow.  Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, of charting unmapped territories among the stars, fueled her unwavering determination, a quest for the unknown in a future far removed from medieval perils, yet no less adventurous.
