
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, spurred his weary horse onward.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, promising both refuge and peril.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine holding the cure for his sister's wasting illness, had taken him across treacherous passes, through bandit-infested forests, and over sun-baked plains.  Each day brought the threat of starvation, wild beasts, or the cruel indifference of nature, but the unwavering hope for his sister's survival fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of cryo-preserved seeds to the newly colonized planet of Aethel, a world teeming with both opportunity and unknown dangers.  Warp jumps were risky, the vastness of space unforgiving, and pirate raids a constant threat. Yet, Elara, fueled by a sense of duty to her people and a yearning for exploration, pressed on, charting a course through the cosmic wilderness, each jump a leap of faith into the heart of the unknown.
