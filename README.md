
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume him and his loyal squire.  Yet, the hope of salvation fuels his onward journey, a flickering candle against the vast, indifferent darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating through asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms are everyday occurrences, but the true danger lies in the unstable wormholes that are her only shortcut across the vast expanse of the galaxy.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the possibility of rescuing the lost colonists keeps Eva's spirit burning bright, a beacon in the cold, endless darkness of space.
