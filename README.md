
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the secret to a forgotten magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve daily, yet the whispered promise of untold wonders kept her pushing forward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been treacherous, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a civilization clinging to survival amidst the cosmic expanse.  The vastness of space, a stark contrast to the limitations of medieval travel, presented a different kind of danger – the silent, crushing weight of the unknown, the threat of rogue asteroids, and the possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  But like Elara before her, Eva pressed on, driven by a thirst for discovery that transcended time and space.
