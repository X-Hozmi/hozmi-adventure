
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the biting wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead stretched the unforgiving expanse of the Rhône Valley, a ribbon of green snaking through the ochre landscape.  Her quest: to reach Avignon and deliver a vital message to the Pope, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each day was a battle against the elements and the unpredictable nature of medieval travel; a test of endurance and will that forged her into something stronger than she had ever imagined.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the Xylos Nebula in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The kaleidoscope of colours swirling around him, each a different star system teeming with life or the remnants of dead worlds, was a breathtaking but dangerous spectacle. His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a powerful energy source rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey would test the limits of his ship's technology and his own courage, pitting him against hostile alien species, treacherous asteroid fields, and the uncharted depths of the vast, unknown cosmos.
