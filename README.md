
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King—a plea for aid from a distant, allied kingdom.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this lawless land, filled with bandits, warring factions, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Her journey was a desperate race against time, a testament to unwavering loyalty amidst the brutal realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae swirling past her viewport were a breathtaking sight, yet the mission was far from leisurely.  Their destination, Xylos, held the key to a galactic peace treaty, but a treacherous wormhole lurked between them and their goal, a space-time distortion that could crush a ship in an instant.  With her seasoned crew, Ryla prepared for the perilous jump, their courage a stark contrast to the cold, indifferent vastness of the cosmos.
