
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in silks, destined for a distant trading post.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild animals, or the harsher realities of starvation and exposure.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to see lands beyond her village, fueled her onward, a stubborn ember against the cold wind.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the iridescent clouds a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of a thousand distant suns.  Their mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole rumored to lead to a galaxy teeming with unexplored planets.  The risk was immense—uncharted space held dangers far exceeding any medieval bandit: gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien life. But the promise of discovery, the allure of charting the unknown frontiers of the cosmos, surpassed any fear, driving them further into the breathtaking, and terrifying, void.
