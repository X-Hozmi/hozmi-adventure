Each muddy mile brought them closer to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their mettle.  Yet, the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches spurred them onward, the clang of their armor a defiant echo against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

The rewards, however, were potentially galaxy-spanning, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration.
