
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara's caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wooden wheels a constant counterpoint to the rhythmic clip-clop of horses' hooves.  Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the endless expanse of desert tested their endurance. Yet, the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches spurred them onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the ship's navigation system.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora. The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms. But the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and expansion, was a powerful engine, driving them across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
