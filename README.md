
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with maps and dried provisions, swung against her hip.  This wasn't a pilgrimage to a holy site, but a desperate journey to the rumored healer in the far north, a woman said to possess a touch that could mend her brother's ravaged lungs.  Bandit patrols, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown were small prices to pay for a chance at salvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill – and terror – of the unpredictable medieval road.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort as he navigated by the constellations, far beyond the known charts.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos nebula, rumored to contain an energy source capable of powering the dying Sol system.   He faced threats far more alien than bandits – hostile space pirates, unpredictable wormholes, and the vast, indifferent expanse of space itself. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, fueled his journey across the cosmic ocean, a quest as daring as any medieval pilgrimage.
