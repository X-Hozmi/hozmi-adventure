
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Reginald's lungs as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with danger.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the very elements – scorching heat, torrential rain – threatened to end his journey before it reached its conclusion.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the mythical lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders was child's play compared to the psychological toll of years spent light-years from home.  The vast, inky blackness of space, peppered with the brilliant pinpricks of distant suns, held a beauty and terror unknown to any medieval knight; the ultimate adventure lay not in the dangers encountered, but in the boundless unknown itself.
