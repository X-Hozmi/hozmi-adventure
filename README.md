
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, heightened the palpable sense of danger.  Her quest: to reach Avignon before the Black Death claimed her family, a desperate journey fueled by dwindling supplies and unwavering hope.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of disease were constant companions on this medieval odyssey, testing the limits of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor"  Ronson piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unpredictable celestial anomalies.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of engine failure were all in a day's work for Razor,  a seasoned spacer whose bravery and skill were tested not just by the vastness of space, but by the unpredictable nature of galactic politics.
