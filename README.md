
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Thomas, a young cartographer, spurred his weary horse onward.  His worn leather satchel contained not gold, but the painstakingly drawn maps charting a rumored hidden city, whispered about in hushed tones by grizzled traders.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to etch his name onto the world, spurred him forward, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating through asteroid fields, evading pirate ships camouflaged amongst rogue planets, and battling the insidious effects of interstellar radiation were everyday occurrences.   The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, held a different kind of peril, a loneliness amplified by the silence of the void, but the hope of finding survivors and unlocking the colony's secrets fueled her tireless journey across the galactic expanse.
