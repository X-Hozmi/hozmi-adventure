
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of sun-baked earth and the distant, acrid tang of woodsmoke.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, a perilous but necessary crossing on his journey to the Sultan's court, a quest fraught with bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the scrub, sharpened his senses, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Her mission, to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, felt as perilous as any medieval journey, the vast emptiness of space a chilling counterpoint to the vibrant, alien landscapes that flickered past her viewport.  The galaxy was a vast ocean, and her ship, a fragile raft.
