
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in desolate villages, and facing the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, a flicker of hope ignited within her weary heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the quarantined colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates were commonplace hazards, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns; a single navigational error could mean the difference between life and oblivion.  But Eva, steeled by years of interstellar travel, held fast to her course, driven by a commitment to those who relied on her arrival.
