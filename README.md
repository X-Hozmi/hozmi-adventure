Days bled into weeks, the chill autumn wind a constant companion as he journeyed from the King's court to the rumored hidden monastery, said to possess a relic of immense power.

The vast distances, the loneliness of space, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life were a constant challenge, yet the potential reward—the unlocking of galactic exploration—made the risk worthwhile.
