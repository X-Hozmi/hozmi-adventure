
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward. The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a ribbon of brown cutting through fields of gold.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored riches, and the hope it represented, fueled his tireless journey across the vast, unpredictable land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity’s expanding empire.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between star systems, but the cosmos held dangers unseen by earthly eyes – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien civilizations. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, breathtaking, and terrifying unknown.
