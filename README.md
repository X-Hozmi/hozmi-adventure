
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored monastery holding the lost scrolls of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory in this epic quest across a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been rough, the hyperspace turbulence testing the ship's hull to its limits. But the promise of a new world, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, fueled her determination.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held infinite possibilities, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
