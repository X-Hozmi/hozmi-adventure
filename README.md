
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth looming before them. Their journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager provisions in isolated villages, and defending themselves against both the elements and desperate men. Yet, the allure of Jerusalem, the promise of redemption and adventure, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and retrieve vital data. The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying; the silent hum of the hyperdrive punctuated by the occasional crackle of cosmic radiation.  Each jump across light years presented a gamble, a calculated risk against malfunctioning engines and unforeseen gravitational anomalies. But the weight of her responsibility, the hope for humanity's future, fueled her courage as she navigated the uncharted expanse.
