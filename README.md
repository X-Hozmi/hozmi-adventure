
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the wind whipping at her cloak.  Before her stretches the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, a treacherous path to the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, but the whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic fuel her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each aching muscle, is a testament to her courage and the allure of the unknown, a journey testing both her physical and spiritual resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  He’s on a mission to retrieve the rare Xylossian crystals, vital to jump-starting the failing galactic core.   Across light-years and through asteroid fields, he and his crew face the ever-present dangers of rogue space pirates, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling emptiness of the void. The thrill of interstellar exploration, however, far outweighs the peril, the promise of galactic salvation a beacon guiding them through the endless dark.
