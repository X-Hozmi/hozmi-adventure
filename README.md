
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Days blurred into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and the gnawing hunger that tested their resolve.  Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the chilling reality of their perilous journey across a vast and unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet, Xylos, far beyond charted space.  The journey was a symphony of swirling nebulae and silent, desolate voids, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unknown dangers.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, battled not bandits and hunger but malfunctioning engines, hostile alien lifeforms, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The promise of a new world fueled their courage against the vast, unknowable expanse.
