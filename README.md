
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary horse onward.  The map, a crudely drawn parchment clutched in his calloused hand, promised riches beyond imagining in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with its own dangers: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system malfunctions light-years from any rescue.  But the promise of discovering new civilizations, charting unmapped star systems, and unlocking the secrets of the universe far outweighed the risks.  The vast, glittering expanse of space beckoned, a limitless canvas for human ambition and courage.
