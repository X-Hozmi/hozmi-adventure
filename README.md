Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hurried scribbles, offered little comfort against the biting wind.

Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Serpent's Maw was child's play compared to the political minefield of Xylos itself, where warring factions and powerful corporations vied for control of the precious mineral.  The risks were immense, but the potential rewards, limitless.
