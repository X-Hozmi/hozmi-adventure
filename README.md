
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched a faded map, its edges frayed from countless journeys across the treacherous terrain.  His quest: to find the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles standing between him and his goal, making every sunrise a gamble against fate.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unknown gravitational anomalies and potential encounters with hostile alien civilizations.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, unpredictable expanse of the cosmos. The fate of her crew, and the future of interstellar exploration, rested on her skill and courage.
