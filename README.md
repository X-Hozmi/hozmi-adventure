
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll; his once-proud warhorse, Samson, limped with each labored step.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in Kaelan's heart.  He clutched the king's sealed decree, a desperate mission to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for a spreading plague.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the creeping sickness itself.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation bombarded the ship's hull, while asteroid fields demanded precise maneuvers.  The weight of her mission – to search for a new home for humanity – pressed heavily upon her, a stark contrast to the ancient quest for a simple cure.  But like Kaelan before her, she pressed on, driven by a hope that transcended time and distance.
