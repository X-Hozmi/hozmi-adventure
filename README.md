
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a daunting backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, patched with scraps of parchment, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the valley below – a sanctuary rumored to hold ancient healing secrets for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of reaching the monastery, of finding salvation for her brother, fueled her weary steps forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, vibrant colours swirling around her ship like cosmic paint.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Xylos, a planet orbiting a distant, pulsating star.  The journey was fraught with its own perils: unstable wormholes, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile space pirates.  But the potential discovery within the data core – a key to faster-than-light travel – made the interstellar voyage, and its inherent dangers, a necessary gamble for the future of humanity.
