
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resolve.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: fording raging rivers, navigating dense forests teeming with unseen creatures, and bartering for meager provisions in dusty, forgotten villages. The allure of the sacred city, however, fueled their weary steps, a beacon against the vast unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with its own unique dangers.  Asteroidal fields threatened to shred their ship, uncharted gravitational anomalies warped spacetime, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms loomed large. Yet, the promise of discovery, of unveiling the universe's mysteries, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the cosmic sea.
