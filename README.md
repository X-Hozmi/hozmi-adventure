
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Their journey to the Sultan's court, a perilous trek across the unforgiving steppes, was fraught with danger.  Bandits lurked in every shadow, and the whispered threat of the plague hung heavy in the air, a more insidious foe than any man.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant howl of a wolf, served as a reminder of the precariousness of their quest for the legendary Sunstone.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her heart pounding a rhythm matching the hyperdrive's hum.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and fiery gas, held the promise of a new world, but also the terrifying unknown.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic Kryll raiders were child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting her on Xylos, a planet teeming with warring factions and ancient secrets.  The treasure this time wasn't stone, but knowledge – the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel for all of humankind.
