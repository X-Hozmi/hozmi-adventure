
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon’s Teeth mountains fiery red. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King’s court.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the chilling unknown of the uncharted territories ahead. Her journey was fraught with peril, but the whispered legends of the King’s legendary generosity fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in the sleek starship 'Stardust'.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet promising a new beginning for humanity.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting roar against the infinite void. Yet, the cosmic expanse held its own dangers: unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies.  Their mission was not merely exploration, but survival; a gamble against the odds for a future among the stars.
