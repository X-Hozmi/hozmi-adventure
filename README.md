
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits, pushing them further along the arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, in the year 2742, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Zydonian civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  The journey, spanning light-years and perilous asteroid fields, tested the limits of both ship and crew.  Facing down hostile space pirates, navigating treacherous wormholes, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of cosmic radiation were all part of the daily routine. But Eva, driven by an unyielding curiosity and a thirst for discovery, navigated the vast emptiness of space,  forever pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
