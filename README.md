
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne, each mile a battle against parched throat, bandit ambush, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  He carried with him only a worn map, a rusty sword, and the unwavering hope that fueled his arduous journey across the treacherous heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with perils, from rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies to the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a crew of equally brave souls, pressed on, driven by the promise of discovery and the hope of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
