
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and hastily scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the endless, treacherous paths.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in desolate villages, and constantly watching for the glint of steel in the shadows.  Survival, not mere sightseeing, was the true adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of Kepler-186f a distant memory.  His starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', hummed with the energy of a thousand suns as he charted a course towards the unmapped Andromeda galaxy.  The thrill wasn't in the speed – faster-than-light travel had rendered distance almost meaningless – but in the discovery.  Each jump through hyperspace presented the potential for new life, new worlds, and the ever-present risk of encountering the unpredictable dangers lurking beyond the known reaches of human space.
