
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on.  Their journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar terrain to bartering for meager sustenance in squalid villages. Yet, the allure of the Crusade, the whispered tales of legendary artifacts and the chance to prove his valor, spurred them onward, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the inky expanse between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system and its rumored source of limitless energy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her resolve.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where the breathtaking beauty of nebulae concealed the deadly reality of cosmic radiation and uncharted dangers. But the potential reward, the salvation of a dying Earth, fuelled her onward, a solitary figure facing the vast, unforgiving majesty of the cosmos.
