
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary men, snakes across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a whispered legend of a lost city, the chilling possibility of bandit ambushes, the stark beauty of untouched wilderness.  The scent of woodsmoke mingles with the dust, a constant companion on this arduous journey eastward, towards the mythical Silk Road, a path paved with both riches and peril.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the tall grass, is a potential adventure waiting to unfold.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of folding space, carries me across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Nebulae blaze like celestial fireworks beyond the viewport, a breathtaking backdrop to our mission:  to locate a rumored habitable planet within the Cygnus X-1 system.  The challenge isn't just the perilous journey through uncharted space –  it's the unknown dangers that lurk on the planet itself, a world veiled in mystery and promising both unimaginable discovery and potential annihilation.
