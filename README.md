
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Rumors of bandit raids whisper on the wind, mingling with the cries of our weary oxen.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every league covered, the thrill of the unknown fuels our journey, the lure of distant markets and whispered legends outweighing the hardships.


Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The Althea, a sleek starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby, punctuated by the occasional jolt of traversing wormholes.  We face challenges unimaginable to our medieval ancestors – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, friend or foe. Yet, the breathtaking vista of nebulae and the hope of discovering a new home make the risks worthwhile.
