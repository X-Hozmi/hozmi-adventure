
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King, a desperate plea for aid against a looming rebellion.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for ambush, for the harsh realities of medieval travel were as daunting as any dragon's fire.  She pressed onward, spurred by duty and a flickering hope of reaching her destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the alien landscapes and unpredictable phenomena awaiting her on the planet's surface.  The adventure lay not just in reaching her destination, but in the vast, unknown expanse between the stars.
