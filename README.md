
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on their backs.  Their journey across the war-torn kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim their lives, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating confusing, overgrown trails to bartering for meager supplies in hostile villages.  Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, hidden in the far east, fueled their determination to press on.


Centuries later,  Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of her vessel.  Her mission: to locate and secure the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the monumental scale of her undertaking. The fate of two worlds rested on her shoulders, and every jump to hyperspace brought them closer to their destiny – or their doom.
