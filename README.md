
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone monastery nestled deep in the Carpathian mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges they faced.  Each sunrise brought new trials, but the whispered legends of the Sunstone’s healing powers spurred them onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across a dozen planets in a distant galaxy.  Warp jumps were treacherous, each a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and hostile alien life forms.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of their isolation and the immense distances they had to traverse to reach their destination.  The fate of thousands hung in the balance, a burden carried on Eva's weary shoulders.
