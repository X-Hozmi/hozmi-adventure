
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the legendary Shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their mettle.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies were merely inconveniences compared to the gnawing uncertainty of their destination.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, and each sunset the chilling reality of the vast, unknown land that still lay before them.  Their only companions were their unwavering faith and the shared burden of their quest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research station orbiting Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace had been jarring, but the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos compensated for the nausea.  The real challenge lay in navigating the treacherous asteroid field surrounding the station, a deadly maze fraught with unpredictable gravitational forces.  With each successful maneuver, Eva felt a surge of adrenaline – the thrill of exploration in the face of unimaginable risks was a powerful drug, a constant reminder of why she chose this life among the stars.
