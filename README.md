
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest, shadows lengthening as twilight approached.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine – were they bandits, wild beasts, or something far more sinister?  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Cuthbert, a journey fraught with peril and uncertainty but promising untold rewards, both spiritual and temporal.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hyperspace jump had been brutal, the ship groaning under the strain, but now they were finally entering the system, the alien star a blazing jewel in the inky black.  The challenges were different now – asteroid fields, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, burned just as brightly as it did in Sir Reginald's time.
