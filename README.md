Ahead, the shadowy peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the whispered promise of salvation fueled her onward, each sunrise a new challenge to overcome in her desperate, perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of famine.  Navigation through asteroid fields, evading pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the constant strain of hyperspace travel tested her crew to their limits. But the hope of sustaining life on a distant world, and the bond she shared with her crew, propelled them through the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
