
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of Castile was fraught with peril, each rise revealing new challenges: looming castles of unfriendly lords,  sun-scorched rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical City of Gold spurred her onward, a beacon of hope amidst the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Every creak of her saddle, every howl of the wind, was a chapter in her epic, unfolding adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the bridge.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a feat deemed impossible by many.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading rogue space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies, she pushed the boundaries of human exploration. Each jump to warp speed was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos, fuelled by an insatiable thirst for discovery.
