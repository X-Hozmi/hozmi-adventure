
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their mettle, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the quiet comfort of a shared fire and whispered tales of far-off lands, fueling their determination to reach their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the newly-discovered planet Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy took months, a constant dance between navigating asteroid fields, repairing laser cannons damaged by cosmic radiation, and the ever-present loneliness of deep space travel.  But the weight of her responsibility – the chance to build a new home for humanity – kept her focused, her gaze ever forward towards the promise of a new dawn on a distant world.
