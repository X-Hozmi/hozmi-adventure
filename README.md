
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the cryptic map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient healing powers.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a new challenge to overcome in her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the jolt reverberating through the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their jump to the Xylos system had been rough, throwing the crew against bulkheads, but the shimmering nebula before them, a swirling canvas of cosmic colours, was worth the nausea.  Ahead lay the unexplored Xylos VII, a planet rumored to hold a key to faster-than-light travel, a secret coveted by empires across the galaxy.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – but the thrill of discovery, the siren call of the uncharted cosmos, remained a potent force driving humanity's relentless expansion into the great unknown.
