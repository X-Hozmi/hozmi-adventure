
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, a knight errant with a thirst for glory and a battered shield, spurred his destrier onward, the chill wind whipping at his worn surcoat.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden in the heart of the unforgiving Sahara.  He rode through sun-baked plains, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and bartered with suspicious desert tribes, each day a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the scorching sun.  His journey was a tapestry woven with peril and breathtaking beauty, a testament to human endurance in the face of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the Kepler Array, a device crucial to humanity's survival.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing warp core breaches became commonplace as she traversed the immeasurable distances between star systems.  While lacking the immediate physical danger of Kaelan's journey, Eva faced an existential threat from the cold, indifferent vastness of space, a test not of physical strength, but of technological prowess and unwavering courage in the face of cosmic uncertainty.
