
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a brutal tapestry woven with hardship and hope, their determination fueled by a desperate need to return with salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous undertaking even with advanced warp drive technology.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outwitting pirate fleets, and enduring the psychological strain of interstellar travel tested her and her crew to their limits.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond any medieval knight could have imagined, yet the human spirit of exploration burned just as brightly.
