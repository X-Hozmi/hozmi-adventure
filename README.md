
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the next windswept hill, the spires of Camelot a distant memory. His quest, to retrieve the stolen Sunstone, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and into the shadowy embrace of the Whispering Woods, where goblin whispers echoed in his dreams.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: bandits, starvation, and the gnawing fear that his journey would end not in triumph, but in a nameless grave.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic radiation threatened to fry her ship's systems, pirate raiders lurked in the shadows between stars, and the vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy pressed in on her, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile foothold in the cosmos.
