
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and shadowed alleyways he'd left behind in London weeks ago.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Jude, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers forded only by the grace of God, and into forests where the whispers of unseen things kept even the bravest knight awake at night.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, a constant test of endurance and faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been brutal, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the interstellar alliance from a long-lost colony world, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by hostile lifeforms.  Navigation charts were unreliable, communication with base was sporadic at best, and the ever-present threat of space pirates loomed large.  Her journey, a gamble across the uncharted void, depended entirely on her skill, courage, and the loyalty of her crew.
