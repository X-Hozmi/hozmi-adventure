
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map older than her grandfather.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the chilling uncertainty of reaching her destination, a rumored monastery holding the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, kindness from unexpected strangers, and the unwavering strength of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The journey was fraught with the perils of hyperspace jumps, the ever-present threat of pirate vessels, and the lonely vastness of the cosmos.  Yet, with each successful warp, the thrill of discovery, the camaraderie of his crew, and the allure of the unknown propelled him forward, a modern-day explorer charting the uncharted galaxies.
