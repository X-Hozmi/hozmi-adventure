
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery holding the lost scrolls of Saint Brendan, said to contain the secrets to healing the plague that ravaged her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandit raids were common, and the wild terrain itself posed a constant threat, but the hope of salvation fueled her journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Nird, a perilous journey across uncharted sectors swarming with space pirates and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking vistas of swirling galaxies and unimaginable celestial formations, but the dangers were equally grand – a single navigational error could mean the end of the mission, and perhaps, the crew.  The vastness of space held both wonder and immense, existential threat.
