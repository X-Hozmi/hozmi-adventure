
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant Abbey of Saint-Gilles.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispering wind carried tales of plague-ridden towns, but Elara pressed on, spurred by the unwavering loyalty to her people and the promise of a safe haven. The journey was fraught with peril, each sunrise a victory against the seemingly endless expanse before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Starfall' Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been fraught with gravitational anomalies, testing the ship's shields and Ryla's nerves.  Her mission: to establish first contact with a sentient species rumored to possess technology far surpassing humanity's. The vastness of space held wonders and dangers in equal measure, and Ryla, alone amongst the stars, relied on her wits and courage to overcome the interstellar challenges ahead.
