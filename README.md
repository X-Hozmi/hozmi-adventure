He'd traded the relative safety of the King's court for the whispered promise of El Dorado, a city of gold said to lie beyond the untamed lands.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the perils—and potential rewards—that lay ahead in this medieval quest.

The crew, a band of hardened explorers, held their breath as the ship emerged from warp, the swirling colours of the nebula replaced by the cold, hard light of a new solar system. The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, each jump a leap of faith into the uncharted cosmos.
