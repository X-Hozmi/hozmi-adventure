
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary steed across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to overtake her.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, of shimmering spires and healing waters, fuel her relentless journey, pushing her onward despite the daunting challenges.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the ghostly beauty of dying stars and the terrifying void between worlds, poses a constant threat.  Advanced technology provides a measure of safety, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present danger of pirates and cosmic anomalies keep Rexx and his crew on edge, driving them onward towards their uncertain destination.
