
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumours of exotic spices and silks that fuelled his journey eastward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on his arduous trek across the continent, a pilgrimage driven by a thirst for the unknown and a heart brimming with both fear and exhilaration.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant background to the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and dying stars, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of the ship.  The challenges were different – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dealing with rogue AI, and the ever-present threat of pirates – but the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push the boundaries of the known universe, burned just as brightly in her heart as it had in Thomas's, separated by epochs but united by the spirit of adventure.
