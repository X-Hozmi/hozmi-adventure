
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, bumped against her side.  This journey, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Montfort, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the forests, and the very terrain itself tested her endurance.  Yet, the thought of reaching her destination, of possibly saving lives, spurred her onward, each creak of the saddle a testament to her grit and determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant reminder of the immense distance and the technological marvel propelling her across the galaxy.  Unlike Elara’s earthly journey, Eva’s was measured in lightyears, not miles, her challenges not bandits but cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of system failures in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fuelled her relentless pursuit.
