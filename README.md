
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Black Forest, a tapestry of looming shadows and ancient trees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of danger, a constant companion on his perilous journey to deliver the King's message to the distant Duke.  Wolves howled in the distance, a chilling soundtrack to his solitary quest, a quest that could determine the fate of kingdoms.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her ship, a nimble craft capable of traversing the vast emptiness between galaxies, hummed with the energy of a thousand suns.  Ahead, a shimmering portal beckoned, a gateway to the fabled Kepler-186f system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the journey was far from safe; pirate ships lurked in the shadows of the nebula, ready to ambush and plunder any unsuspecting vessel daring to venture into this treacherous expanse of space.
