
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague haunted the wind.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, parched deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the adventure, kept her pushing onward, her spirit unyielding.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant dance with death.  The thrill of exploration, the vastness of space, and the weight of responsibility for her crew fueled her determination.  The journey was far from easy, but the potential discovery awaiting them on Kepler-186f promised a reward worth the risk.
