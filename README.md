
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey wasn't for glory or riches, but for survival.  News of the Black Death's advance had reached her isolated village, and escape was the only option. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, disease, or worse.  She clutched the worn map, its edges frayed by countless miles, a lifeline in a world teeming with uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula, her starship *Stardust Wanderer* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos artifact, a source of unimaginable power.  Across light-years and through treacherous asteroid fields, she piloted her ship, battling space pirates and navigating treacherous gravitational currents.  The vastness of space held a beauty that matched its danger,  but the weight of her responsibility – to find the artifact before it fell into the wrong hands – was a constant companion, a silent pressure amidst the deafening silence of the stars.
