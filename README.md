
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling manor and a cruel betrothal.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of leaves in the wind, speaks of the unknown dangers that lie ahead – bandits, starvation, disease – a constant reminder of the perilous journey that awaits her across the continent. The only map she possesses is the one etched in her memory and the stars guiding her night-time travel.

Alternatively, imagine  Jax, pilot of the 'Stardust Drifter', hurtling through the nebula of Xylos in 2742.  His ship, a sleek marvel of intergalactic engineering, navigates a tapestry of swirling colours and celestial bodies, each jump a calculated risk between wormholes. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage demanding precision, courage, and a deep understanding of hyperspace navigation. The vast emptiness of space is just as formidable as any earthly terrain; the silent threat of rogue asteroids and uncharted cosmic storms is a constant companion.
