
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – precious seeds of a new grain, destined for a monastery far across the land.  Robbers, bandits, and treacherous mountain passes threaten her journey, but the promise of sustenance for the starving villagers fuels her onward. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another league conquered.  The road ahead is long and perilous, but Elara's heart is filled with the courageous spirit of a medieval adventurer.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming algae to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates demands constant vigilance, her reflexes honed by years of interstellar travel.  The vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos is a constant companion, offset by the loneliness of deep space. Yet, the knowledge that her cargo could bring life to a new world propels her forward, a modern-day adventurer charting the unexplored reaches of the galaxy.
