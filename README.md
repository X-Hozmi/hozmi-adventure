
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Auvergne region.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious seed – a rumored cure for the creeping blight that ravaged her village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the urgency of her quest. Each sunrise brought new challenges, forcing her to rely on her wits, her courage, and the kindness of strangers encountered along the perilous path.  The journey tested her limits, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylan crystal, a source of unimaginable energy capable of powering a galaxy-spanning network.  The journey between planets was fraught with danger – asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a crew as loyal as they were skilled, navigated these cosmic obstacles with unwavering determination. The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also stark reminders of their isolation and the immense risks they faced in their pursuit of the crystal.
