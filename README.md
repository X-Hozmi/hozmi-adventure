
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary oxen onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the harsh realities of medieval travel:  bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the gnawing hunger in her belly, and the constant threat of disease.  Each creak of the cart wheels, each weary sigh of her animals, echoed the monumental challenge of crossing the continent, a quest fuelled by faith and a desperate hope for salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, *The Icarus*, through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Ahead lay the Andromeda galaxy, a shimmering beacon of unexplored worlds and unimaginable wonders.  While the risks were different – gravitational anomalies, hostile alien species, the ever-present threat of engine failure – the thrill of discovery remained the same, a powerful current driving her across the void.  The vastness of space, unlike the endless plains of medieval Europe, offered a freedom that was both exhilarating and terrifying in its scale.
