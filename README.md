
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid delivered to a distant monastery. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, the river threatened treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, as they pressed onward, their journey a desperate gamble against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rex steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold a rare energy source crucial to galactic stability.  Cosmic radiation crackled against the ship's hull, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  The thrill of discovery warred with the chilling loneliness of interstellar travel, the unknown stretching out before them like an infinite, star-dusted ocean.
