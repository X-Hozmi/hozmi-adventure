
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored City of Whispers, led them across kingdoms and treacherous mountain passes, each sunrise a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The whispers of the city, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fuelled their weary bodies, pushing them further into the unforgiving wilderness.  Every creak of their saddles, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the vast emptiness between star systems still held its own brand of isolation.  Each jump represented a calculated risk – navigational errors meant drifting through uncharted space, encountering hostile alien life, or worse, encountering the void itself.  Yet the promise of new worlds, uncharted planets teeming with life and resources, drove her onward, a modern-day explorer charting the galaxy's boundless frontier.
