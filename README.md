
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a loveless marriage.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  Yet, with every sunrise, the vastness of the journey fueled her determination, each landmark a testament to her resilience, and every star a silent witness to her solitary adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a swathe through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were all in a day's work.  The vast, unimaginable scale of the cosmos dwarfed even her seasoned experience, yet the thrill of discovery – of pushing the boundaries of human exploration – eclipsed any fear. The unknown stretched before them, a canvas painted with the vibrant hues of a million galaxies.
