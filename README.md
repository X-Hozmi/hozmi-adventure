
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a haphazard collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air shimmers with heat, the distant mountains hazy silhouettes against a brassy sky.  Each day brings the risk of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of unimaginable riches and exotic spices, fuels our onward journey. We barter with shrewd villagers, navigate crumbling Roman roads, and sleep under a canopy of stars, our lives a constant dance between peril and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship humming with the low thrum of its fusion engines, carries me across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life.  The journey is measured in generations, a tapestry woven from the lives and legacies of countless voyagers.  We navigate nebulae painted across the cosmos, dodge rogue asteroids, and grapple with the ever-present anxieties of interstellar travel – the mechanical failures, the social tensions, the haunting solitude of deep space. But the hope of discovering another world, another chance for humanity, propels us onward.
