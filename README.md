
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious map, leading her to a rumored monastery possessing ancient healing secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, already claiming lives across the land.  Survival, and the hope of a cure, fueled her relentless journey.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at faster-than-light speed.  The risks were cosmic – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the potential discovery of a new habitable world, a new beginning for humanity, outweighed every danger.
