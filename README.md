
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was far from over; bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed. Yet, the whispered tales of the lost city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis brimming with ancient knowledge and untold riches, fueled her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each aching muscle, was a step closer to the legendary prize.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship *Hope*, lost somewhere in the uncharted regions of the Andromeda galaxy. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging unpredictable space anomalies was a daily challenge.  But the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of exploring the vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos, kept her and her crew pushing the limits of human endurance.  The galaxy was their frontier, and the search for the *Hope* their grand, perilous adventure.
