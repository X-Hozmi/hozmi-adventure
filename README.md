
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guides her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loom large.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, a beacon of hope in a brutal world, pushes her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr pirates, Ryla and her crew face dangers far beyond those of any medieval knight.  The vast emptiness of space, the alien landscapes of uncharted planets, and the potential for discovery fuel their perilous journey across the cosmos.
