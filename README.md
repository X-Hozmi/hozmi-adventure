
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each step, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving terrain between kingdoms, his small band a mere speck against the vastness of the rolling hills.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that prowled these lawless lands.  His quest: to deliver a vital message, a perilous journey fraught with danger, but one that held the fate of his liege lord in the balance.  The road ahead was long and uncertain, but the call of adventure, the promise of glory (or death), burned brightly in his heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship's sensors registered the gravitational pull of a previously uncharted planet.  This wasn't a mere cross-country ride; this was a journey across the unfathomable expanse of the cosmos, a voyage to the edge of known space in search of a legendary lost colony.  The risks were monumental – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure – but the potential rewards, the secrets hidden amongst the stars, were too enticing to resist. The galaxy was their battlefield, and exploration their weapon.
