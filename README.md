
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged along the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth thick in the air.  Her journey from Canterbury to Rome, a pilgrimage undertaken to fulfill a dying father's wish, was a tapestry woven with hardship and unexpected beauty.  She'd faced bandits in shadowed forests, shared meager meals with weary travelers, and slept beneath a sky ablaze with unfamiliar constellations.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, the allure of the unknown fueling her weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of the cosmos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been a risky one, testing the limits of their experimental warp drive.  Ahead lay a potential goldmine of uncharted planets, each a promise of alien life forms and resources beyond human comprehension, but also the threat of unexplored dangers –  unpredictable gravitational fields, hostile species, and the ever-present fear of getting lost in the infinite expanse of space.
