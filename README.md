
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was far from easy.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward.  The camaraderie of her ragtag band of travelers, bound together by shared risk and a thirst for adventure, was her greatest comfort in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet each jump across the vast expanse of the galaxy remained a gamble.  Uncharted systems held both breathtaking beauty and deadly dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Lost Colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The weight of this responsibility, and the awe-inspiring majesty of the cosmos, fueled her determination to reach her destination.
