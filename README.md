
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his mule through the treacherous Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sends a jolt of fear through him, the whispers of bandits and wild beasts ever-present.  The journey is arduous, days blurring into a monotonous cycle of aching muscles, meager rations, and the constant gnawing uncertainty of reaching his destination alive.  He travels with only a battered map and the unwavering hope for his sister's recovery.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and unimaginable beauty.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The vastness of space, a constant companion, presses in on her.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, the potential for navigational errors or encountering hostile alien lifeforms a constant threat.  Yet, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and the relentless curiosity of exploration, Elara navigates the perilous cosmic currents, her sights fixed on the distant, enigmatic light of Kepler-186f.
