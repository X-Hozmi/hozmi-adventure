
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Each sunrise revealed a new tapestry of rolling hills and ancient forests, punctuated by the occasional crumbling castle or bustling market town.  My journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung like a shroud. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged with fellow travellers, and the breathtaking beauty of the land fueled my weary steps.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became my highway.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion as we leaped across light-years, navigating asteroid fields and nebulae of breathtaking colour.  My mission, a survey of the newly-discovered Kepler-186f, demanded precision and courage.  Alien landscapes, impossible flora, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown life forms kept adrenaline coursing through my veins.  This exploration, though vastly different from my ancestor’s pilgrimage, shared the same underlying spirit: the human thirst for discovery, for pushing the boundaries of the known world, wherever that world may lie.
