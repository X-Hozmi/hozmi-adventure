
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, guided his destrier across the windswept plains.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of the horse was a testament to the arduous journey across the continent.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the perils he faced on his quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  His only companions were the stars above and the unwavering hope in his heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as she navigated asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational wells, charting a course across unmapped sectors of the galaxy to reach the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a powerful energy source capable of saving her dying homeworld.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers, from rogue black holes to hostile alien patrols, yet the lure of survival and discovery fueled her journey through the cosmos.
