
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, their future hinging on reaching the distant port city of Marseilles before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the promise of a new life fueled her onward, each sunrise a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort as she navigated asteroid fields and charted unknown nebulae, searching for the legendary Xylos system and its rumored life-sustaining planets.  While the dangers were different – rogue gravitational pulls, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of engine failure – the spirit of adventure burned as brightly in Ryla's heart as it had in Elara's, both driven by a thirst for discovery and a determination to overcome impossible odds.
