
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the looming threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present fear of the unknown. Yet, the whispered tales of the legendary city of Ys, its streets paved with gold, fueled her onward, a shimmering beacon in the harsh realities of her medieval journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Navigation through the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy required pinpoint precision and nerves of steel.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of swirling colours and distant suns, dwarfed even the grandest terrestrial adventures.  But the thrill of discovery, the chance to encounter alien civilizations and chart unknown territories, surpassed all risks. The quest for the mythical Xylos planet, said to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap, beckoned her crew forward, braving cosmic storms and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile life forms.
