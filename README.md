
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air hangs thick with dust and the scent of roasting lamb, a stark contrast to the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of the rugged hills.  Each sunrise brings the promise of breathtaking vistas – rolling hills giving way to imposing mountain ranges, and the distant shimmer of the Mediterranean. Yet, every sunset brings a fresh wave of apprehension;  the whispers of plague-ridden villages and the constant vigilance needed to protect our meager possessions against those who would steal our lives and livelihoods.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaps across the void between nebulae, the swirling colours of distant galaxies painting the viewports.  This is not the perilous trek of foot across treacherous terrain, but a journey fraught with its own dangers; asteroid fields threaten to shatter our hull, temporal anomalies warp spacetime around us, and the silent expanse itself holds the chilling promise of the unknown.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, new life, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration outweighs all fear.  We seek not just survival, but knowledge and the possibility of a future among the stars.
