
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sluggish serpent of pack mules and weary men, winds its way across the unforgiving Provençal landscape.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We’re bound for Constantinople, carrying silks and spices, risking bandit raids and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings the promise of breathtaking vistas – sun-drenched vineyards, towering castles silhouetted against the sky – but also the grim reality of mud-caked roads and the gnawing hunger in our bellies.  The adventure is perilous, but the allure of distant lands, and the potential riches they hold, fuels our onward march.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship cutting through the inky blackness, hurtles towards Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  We’re a generation ship, carrying humanity’s hope for a new beginning.  The vast emptiness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  stellar nurseries shimmer with vibrant colors, while the threat of asteroid fields and unforeseen cosmic events hangs heavy.  Our journey is measured not in days, but in generations, a testament to human resilience and the unquenchable thirst for exploration across the cosmic sea.
