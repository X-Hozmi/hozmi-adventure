
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just supplies; it holds the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a tyrannical lord.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the sense of peril and adventure as she pushes onward, aided only by the stars and a whispered prayer to the Virgin Mary.  The journey is arduous, the dangers real, but the promise of a new beginning fuels her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula shimmering with a thousand dying suns.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The galaxy stretches before him, a tapestry of breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger.  Cosmic storms threaten to tear his ship apart, while pirate broadcasts crackle with warnings and threats.  But the allure of Xylos, the potential for unlocking the secrets of the universe, outweighs the risks.  The journey is a gamble, but for Rexx, it's the ultimate adventure.
