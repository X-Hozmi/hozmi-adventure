
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's mule strained upwards, the rocky path barely discernible against the unforgiving landscape.  Her worn leather satchel, containing only a few meager coins and a map older than her father, was her only companion on this pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant shadows, but the whispers of Eldoria's healing springs fueled her relentless journey, each sunrise a renewed pledge to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating through nebulae of vibrant hues and skirting the gravity wells of colossal gas giants was a daily routine.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel. The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of unlocking faster-than-light travel, a technological leap that could revolutionize galactic exploration, was a powerful incentive, pushing her and her crew forward into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
