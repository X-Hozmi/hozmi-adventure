
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the King's missive, a sealed scroll promising riches and land in exchange for delivering it to the distant Duke.  His journey was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, each sunset the quiet terror of a night spent alone under the vast, indifferent sky.  Yet, with every league traversed, the allure of adventure burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of shimmering cosmic dust, the vastness of the Andromeda galaxy spread before her. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringe of explored space, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the unknown. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the swirling chaos of the cosmos, with the reward possibly being the discovery of a new civilization, or the cold, silent emptiness of interstellar space.
