
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the cryptic map that spurred her journey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death that plagued the land.  Her quest for the lost Abbey of Saint Seraphina was perilous, yet the promise of ancient knowledge and untold riches fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the cockpit.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumoured to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The journey was fraught with dangers, from rogue asteroids to the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula, but the galaxy's future depended on his success.  He gripped the controls, the cosmos a breathtaking and terrifying tapestry before him.
