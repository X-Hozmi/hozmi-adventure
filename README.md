
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury to seek a cure for the squire's ailing mother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the rivers threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of adventure spurred them onward,  each day a tapestry woven with the challenges and beauty of a world still largely unexplored.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages, the sight of ancient castles perched on distant hills, were rewards in themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace. The vast, inky expanse of space, punctuated by the brilliant hues of distant galaxies, inspired both awe and a healthy dose of fear. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the allure of discovery fueled her tireless pursuit across the galactic frontier.
