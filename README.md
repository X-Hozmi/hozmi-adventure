
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving plains of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, a perilous journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones, led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over sun-baked deserts.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – famished wolves, thieving brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her, a testament to humanity's ceaseless drive to explore the unknown reaches of the universe.
