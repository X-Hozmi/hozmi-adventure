
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, brimming with forgotten riches and ancient magic, fuels our relentless journey. The camaraderie forged in hardship, the shared dangers overcome, and the breathtaking vistas of untamed nature etch themselves into our memories, a testament to the enduring spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Stardust Wanderer' cuts through the inky void, hurtling towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our mission: to locate and secure a rare energy source vital to humanity's survival.  Wormhole jumps are commonplace, yet each one holds a palpable sense of danger; a miscalculation could fling us into uncharted space or a hostile alien territory.  The breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns, the thrill of discovering new worlds, and the daunting responsibility of our task make this interstellar voyage an odyssey unlike any other.
