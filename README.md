
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her family's hopes, chafed against her shoulders.  Each sunrise brought the risk of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty stomachs, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each creak of her saddle and each distant glimpse of a rising mountain, a spark of adventure ignited within her.  She was on a pilgrimage to a distant monastery, a journey fraught with peril but promising salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  The voyage wasn't just across lightyears, but across the vast unknown, a tapestry woven with the threads of warp-speed jumps, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life.  But the promise of a new home, a fresh start among the stars, fueled her unwavering determination.
