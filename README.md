
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – fording icy rivers swollen with meltwater, scaling sheer cliffs, and evading the watchful eyes of bandits lurking in the shadowed valleys.  My destination, the legendary city of Ys, promised untold riches and glory, but the journey itself was a tapestry woven with hardship, breathtaking vistas, and the ever-present thrill of the unknown. Every creak of my saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, both perilous and exhilarating.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, a low thrum vibrating through the deck as we leapt across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae of the Serpent's Maw, dodging asteroid fields the size of small planets, and charting unmapped star systems were commonplace.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of hardship, a loneliness punctuated by the vibrant colours of alien planets and the awe-inspiring majesty of celestial phenomena. The search for the lost colony of Xylos was a quest demanding courage, ingenuity, and a healthy respect for the unforgiving nature of interstellar travel.
