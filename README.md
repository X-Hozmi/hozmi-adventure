
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, a potent antidote to fear. The whispered legends of mythical creatures and forgotten cities fueled her spirit, making the hardships pale in comparison to the promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Nova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was a daily test of skill, but the awe-inspiring vista of countless stars and uncharted planets far outweighed the risks. Each jump through hyperspace promised the discovery of new life, new technologies, and new mysteries to unravel.  The vastness of space was a daunting, exhilarating expanse, a frontier waiting to be explored, and Lyra, at the helm of her vessel, was ready to embrace its boundless potential.
