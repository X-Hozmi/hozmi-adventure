
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in his grand pursuit, each hardship forging his resolve.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially habitable for humans.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing vital systems in the vacuum of space were all part of a typical voyage. But the vastness of the cosmos, the beauty of alien landscapes glimpsed during hyperspace jumps, and the potential for uncovering new life forms fueled her unwavering determination to push the boundaries of human exploration.  The universe was a vast and perilous ocean, but Elara was ready to sail it.
