
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a victory against the biting wind that whipped across the desolate plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between me and my destination: the mythical city of Eldoria.  Rumors whispered of untold riches and powerful magic within its walls, a siren song that spurred me onward despite the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the chilling unknown that lay beyond the next ridge.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won respite under a sky ablaze with the stars.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae paint breathtaking masterpieces across the viewport, a constant reminder of the universe’s grandeur and the insignificance of our little conflicts.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the void is a treacherous place, filled with cosmic anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the chilling possibility that the colony may no longer exist, leaving me adrift in a sea of stars, alone with only my wits and my ship to navigate the unimaginable distances.
