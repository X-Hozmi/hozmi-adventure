
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the rhythmic clop of hooves on hard-packed earth, the endless expanse of sky above, and the constant gnawing fear of bandits, starvation, and the insidious spread of disease itself. Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by hope and the whispered legends of Eldoria's healing powers.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for a humanity struggling with resource depletion.  The vast distances were measured not in leagues, but in light-years, the journey fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  Yet, the promise of a new beginning, a chance for survival and expansion, propelled her and her crew through the perilous void.
