
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a forest primeval, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a hard-won victory in his perilous journey across the uncharted lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Nird, a world light years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew. The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before them, a testament to the endless possibilities and inherent dangers of interstellar travel.
