
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a few coins, a worn map, and the hope of finding her brother in the distant city of Toulouse.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, whispered tales of both danger and possibility. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, yet the lure of reunion spurred her onward.  The road was long, the challenges immense, but the adventure was hers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like Eva.  The galaxy was vast, unpredictable, and brimming with wonders both beautiful and terrifying, a crucible where courage, skill, and a touch of luck determined survival. This journey, however, was unlike any she'd undertaken before – it was a gamble on the future of humankind.
