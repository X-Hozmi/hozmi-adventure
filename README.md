
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, coupled with her brother's weakening condition, fueled her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel. But the knowledge that her cargo would sustain thousands of colonists, pushing the boundaries of human expansion across the galaxy, spurred her on, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the infinite expanse of space.
