
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of Eldoria's legendary spires, glimpsed once in a fleeting vision, fueled his weary heart and spurred him onward, a solitary knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring reconnaissance of the newly discovered Xylos system, rumored to harbor a habitable planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vast, inky expanse of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, each jump to warp speed a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.  The future, and the fate of humanity, hung in the balance.
