
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing King.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vastness of the medieval world.  The hope of success fueled his determination more than any provision.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Unlike Sir Reginald, her journey was measured in light-years, not leagues, the perils alien and cosmic.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were commonplace. Yet, the vastness of the galaxy inspired a sense of awe that mirrored Reginald's, a shared human thirst for discovery echoing through time and space.
