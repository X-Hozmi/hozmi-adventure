
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork quilt of weary horses and even wearier men, creaked across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the swirling anxieties in my gut.  Each day brought the promise of bandits, disease, or simply the relentless march of hunger.  But the lure of the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred us onward, past crumbling castles and whispering forests, a testament to both human resilience and the unforgiving nature of the medieval world.

Conversely, in 2742, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of nebulae swirling past our viewport.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  We faced dangers far removed from bandits and starvation – rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  But the vastness of space, its unimaginable beauty and potential for discovery, dwarfed our fear, propelling us across light-years towards the unknown.
