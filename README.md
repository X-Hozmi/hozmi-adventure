
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, has taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each day brings the peril of starvation, disease, or ambush, yet the allure of the Sunstone and the glory it promises fuels his relentless journey.  His loyal squire, Thomas, rides close behind, their shared hope a flickering flame against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish first contact with the enigmatic K'tharr civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is routine, but the true challenge lies in deciphering the alien signals and forging a peaceful alliance. The vast distances and technological marvels of space travel offer a different kind of hardship, a constant battle against the unforgiving vacuum and the unknown dangers lurking within the cosmos.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, rely on each other's skills and courage as they venture into the uncharted territories of the universe.
