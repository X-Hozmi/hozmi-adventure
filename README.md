
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the knowledge that the path to salvation was fraught with peril.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the K'tharr, a sentient species rumored to possess technology capable of repairing the wormhole network vital for galactic trade.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and deciphering cryptic alien signals, Eva faced challenges as daunting as any medieval knight. Yet, the vastness of space, glittering with uncharted wonders, held a different kind of peril, and a different kind of glory, than any earthly realm.
