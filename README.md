
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a faded parchment clutched tight in her hand, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  This journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a quest for a legendary healing herb, demanded more than courage; it required resilience against bandits, starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown wilderness stretching before her.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the fragile hope of reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging pirate raiders, and battling cosmic storms were all in a day's work.  The loneliness of interstellar travel weighed heavily, but the thought of Xylos, and the possibility of a new beginning, spurred him onward, a flickering star in the inky blackness of space.
