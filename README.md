
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a few precious herbs, and a map promising riches – or ruin – in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Survival, not comfort, was the daily quest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever into overdrive, his starship *Stardust* leaping across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to immortality.  Unlike Elara's journey, Rexx faced dangers unseen and unimagined – rogue asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of Xylos, and the glory it promised, outweighed the risks.  The galaxy was his highway, and immortality, his prize.
