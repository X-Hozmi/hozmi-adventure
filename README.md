
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, guided her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of Eldoria fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast and unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' across the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess a unique energy source capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates, Eva relied on her advanced technology and seasoned crew, but the vastness of space held dangers beyond human comprehension. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos.
