
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, vast, unforgiving deserts where thirst gnawed at the soul, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim satisfaction of survival, driving him further along the path towards the legendary oasis.  He carried with him only a worn map, a loyal sword, and a hope as unwavering as the northern star.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through a nebula of iridescent gas, its colours shifting like a cosmic aurora. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien lifeforms.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to uncover new forms of life and expand humanity's reach into the cosmos, fueled her and her crew, pushing them onward across the infinite expanse of space, a tiny speck of courage against the vast, unknowable universe.
