
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the muddy, rutted track.  Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes. Each creak of Bess's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sends a jolt of adrenaline through Reginald.  They share meager rations, their hope fueled by the King’s promise of riches and the unwavering loyalty between knight and squire. The journey is arduous, their spirits tested by hunger and fear, yet the thrill of the unknown keeps them moving forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding colony.  Light years separate them from Earth, the familiar constellations replaced by a swirling nebula of vibrant colours.  The hum of the ship’s engines, a constant companion, is a lullaby against the infinite silence of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, uncharted celestial phenomena, Eva and her crew face dangers far removed from the medieval knight's, yet the spirit of adventure—the thrill of exploration and discovery—burns as brightly in their hearts.
