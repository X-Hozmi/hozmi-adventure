
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels a mix of dread and hope.  Bandits, starvation, and the sheer vastness of the unknown are constant companions on this perilous journey across the blistered lands of the Holy Roman Empire, where every sunrise brings a new challenge, and every sunset a renewed determination to reach her goal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the shadowy pirate factions that plague the intergalactic trade routes demands precision and courage.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant stars, is as breathtaking as it is terrifying,  a constant reminder of the immense scale of her adventure and the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.
