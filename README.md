
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, offers little comfort against the uncertainty of the road ahead.  Each town a gamble: hospitality or hostility, sustenance or starvation.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and whispers of the Black Death chill the very air.  Yet, the lure of the distant monastery, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, fuels her relentless journey, a testament to the enduring human spirit facing unimaginable odds.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Warp drives hum, defying the laws of space and time as she charts a course to Kepler-186f, a planet light years away, promising untold riches and scientific discovery.  The vastness of the galaxy is both terrifying and exhilarating; alien encounters, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets are mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of exploration, the insatiable human desire to reach for the stars.
