
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried bread and a chipped flint, but her heart throbbed with the thrill of the unknown.  She was bound for the rumored monastery in the Pyrenees, a pilgrimage fueled by whispers of ancient texts and hidden knowledge, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, every sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, CORA, calmly reporting navigation data.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sector bordering the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril; unforeseen gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of engine failure tested the crew's courage and skill. But the lure of discovery, the chance to uncover the secrets of the cosmos, outweighed any fear.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the breathtaking unknown.
