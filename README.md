
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in smuggled spices, a desperate hope for a better life in the distant city of Antioch, and a gnawing fear of bandits and the unforgiving wilderness that stretched ahead.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, reminding her of the constant peril of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the ship's bridge.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  While the dangers were different—alien lifeforms, volatile atmospheric conditions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids—the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, remained a constant, echoing the spirit of countless adventurers who had come before her, across time and space.
