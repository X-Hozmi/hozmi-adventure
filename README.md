
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor substitute for the fear gnawing at her.  Her journey to Avignon, ostensibly a pilgrimage, was in truth a desperate flight from a vengeful baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine.  Bandit-ridden forests and treacherous mountain passes lay ahead, but the thought of freedom, however fragile, spurred her onward.  She clutched the worn leather pouch containing her family's only remaining heirloom – a silver locket, her only tangible link to a life she might never see again.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders, she relied on her crew’s skill and her own unwavering determination.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life, the immense distances separating her from home, and the weight of the responsibility she carried.
