
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Her journey from the coastal village to the fabled city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the whispered legends of Eldoria's shimmering spires and forgotten magic fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the vastness of the cosmos a breathtaking and terrifying spectacle.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of solar flares were commonplace hazards, far removed from the earthly dangers Elara faced, yet just as demanding of skill, courage, and unwavering determination. The universe offered limitless possibilities, but it was also a profoundly lonely and dangerous place.
