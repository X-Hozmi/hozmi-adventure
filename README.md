
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the windswept hill, the harsh landscape of the French countryside stretching before him like a wrinkled tapestry.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Ys before winter's grip tightened – felt as distant as the shimmering horizon.  Each day was a battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits, but the whispers of Ys, of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled his onward journey.  The rough-hewn map clutched in his hand, stained with sweat and rain, was his only guide through the perilous unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bioluminescent flora to the Xylossian colony, a precarious jump across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a daily routine.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held no fear for Elara; she was a child of the stars, driven by a thirst for exploration that mirrored the medieval knights of old, but with faster-than-light travel and advanced technology replacing swords and horses.
