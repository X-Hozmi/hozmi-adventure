
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke a faint comfort against the oppressive heat. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the endless expanse of desert threatened to swallow her whole. Yet, with each sunrise painting the sky in vibrant hues, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the promise of discovery outweighing the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light years.  The vast, glittering tapestry of space held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying emptiness, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the immensity of the cosmos.
