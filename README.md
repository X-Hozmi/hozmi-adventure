
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling markets he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the glint of hope, the desperate need to save his people, fueled his relentless journey across the treacherous landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the nebula's swirling crimson dust, the gargantuan hull of her starship, *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a thousand burning suns. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a devastating hyperspace rift.  Faster-than-light travel had its risks, the unpredictable currents threatening to tear her vessel apart, but Elara, a veteran of countless galactic voyages, held firm, her gaze fixed on the coordinates, driven by a promise made to those she'd left behind, a promise to bring them home.
