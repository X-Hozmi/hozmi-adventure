
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unforgiving terrain tested her strength at every turn.  Yet, the whispers of a lost city, filled with ancient magic and untold riches, fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness. Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath, was a testament to her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' piloted her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and burning gases, were breathtaking, but hid the treacherous asteroid fields she navigated with practiced ease. Her mission: to locate the fabled Kryll artifact, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies. The vastness of space was a daunting challenge, but the promise of unlocking interstellar travel spurred her onward, a lone voyager charting a course through the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
