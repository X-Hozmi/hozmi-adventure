
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming ahead.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and hastily-added scribbles, offered little comfort against the encroaching twilight.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, but the path was fraught with peril: bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, amplified her growing unease, yet the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of glory, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting the cockpit in ethereal hues. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey had already spanned decades, filled with warp jumps through uncharted space, close encounters with rogue asteroids, and the constant hum of the ship's engines.  Despite the advanced technology, the vastness of the cosmos instilled a primal fear, a humbling reminder of humanity's fragile position amidst the infinite stars. Yet, the quest for new life, for new worlds, fueled her resolve, driving her ever closer to the unknown.
