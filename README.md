
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each crest conquered, each treacherous ford navigated, a surge of exhilaration pulsed through her, fueling her onward against the backdrop of a vast, unforgiving, and endlessly beautiful world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The jump itself was a moment of disorienting sensory overload, a kaleidoscope of impossible colours and gravitational pressures.  But the destination, a newly discovered planet teeming with strange flora and unknown sentient life, was worth the risk.  The vastness of space, a canvas splattered with nebulae and the pinpricks of distant suns, dwarfed even the grandest terrestrial journeys, demanding courage, resilience, and an unquenchable thirst for discovery.
