
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered directions, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next bend in the rocky trail – a journey to the distant city of Constantinople felt like a lifetime away, yet held the promise of a life-altering discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the quiet fear that gnawed at her – the uncharted territories of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to chart new worlds and expand humanity’s reach, fuelled her onward, a lone explorer pushing the boundaries of human ambition across the vast, star-dusted canvas of the galaxy.
