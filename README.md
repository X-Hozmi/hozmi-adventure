
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a perilous trek across the Holy Roman Empire to reach her estranged brother, was far from glamorous.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the glint of hope in her heart, fueled by a desperate need for family, burned brighter than any campfire. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each milestone a hard-won victory in her epic overland adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, the ship shuddering gently as it leaped between star systems, dodging asteroid fields and battling the occasional space pirate.  While the technology was vastly superior to Elara's era, the loneliness of space and the unknown dangers lurking in the unexplored reaches of the cosmos were a challenge of a different, equally perilous kind. The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed the fear, a constant pull towards the next jump, the next planet, the next clue leading her to her elusive destination.
