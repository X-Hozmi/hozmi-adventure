
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages to navigating by the stars in the unforgiving darkness, yet the unwavering faith in her heart fueled her onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring capacity for adventure in a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the fabled Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  Her mission: to chart the planet's unexplored territories and search for signs of sentient life.  While lacking the immediacy of medieval danger, the journey presented its own unique perils – navigating asteroid fields, dealing with unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of finding something new under a million stars, pushed her ever further into the cosmic unknown.
