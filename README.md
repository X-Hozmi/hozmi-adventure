
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each sunrise brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, the whispered promise of Zerzura fuels her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped Kepler-186f system, searching for habitable planets.  The journey is perilous, demanding constant vigilance against meteor showers, gravitational anomalies, and the unpredictable behavior of wormholes. Yet, the potential discovery of new life – of a new home – eclipses the risks, making every warp jump a thrilling gamble in the grand cosmic lottery.
