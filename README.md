
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône Valley, the setting sun painting the Provençal landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map promising the location of a lost monastery, rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the Inquisition, hot on her trail for her heretical beliefs.  Survival depended on her wits, her strength, and the kindness of strangers encountered along this perilous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, speckled with nebulae and shimmering constellations, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, alien lifeforms lurked in the shadows of uncharted planets, and the ever-present risk of engine failure loomed large.  Yet, the allure of discovery burned brighter than any fear, pushing Eva onward towards the unknown.
