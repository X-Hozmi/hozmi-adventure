
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  The King's decree, a cryptic summons to a distant abbey rumored to hold ancient secrets, had thrust her into this perilous journey.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and whispers of a plague stalked the land, each a potential end to her quest.  Yet, the promise of unraveling the abbey's mysteries spurred her onward, a thrill of adventure outweighing the ever-present fear.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the Kepler-186f system.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a counterpoint to the crackling comms chatter reporting pirate activity in the outer rim.  This wasn't a simple cargo run; Eva was searching for the legendary lost colony of Aethel, a myth whispered among starfarers for generations.  The vast, unknown expanse of space held both incredible beauty and unimaginable danger, but the lure of discovery, the possibility of finding Aethel, burned brighter than any star.
