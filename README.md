
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the known world, fuels his onward journey, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula shimmering with a thousand impossible colours. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien territories.  Advanced technology offers protection, but the vast, unknowable expanse of space holds its own terrors – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the chilling loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to map the uncharted regions of the cosmos, drives her and her crew forward, their courage a testament to humanity's enduring thirst for exploration.
