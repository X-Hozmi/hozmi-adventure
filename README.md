
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin straining with each step, urged his mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth of the King's Road, a ribbon of barely-there track snaking through a landscape of scrub and crumbling castles.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Serendib, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, famine, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurked around every bend, but the hope of salvation fueled his weary limbs, pushing him ever closer to the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay the Andromeda Galaxy, a destination decades away, a journey measured not in miles, but in light years.  Her mission: to chart unexplored planetary systems, searching for habitable worlds and new resources.  The dangers were different – solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien civilizations – but the spirit of adventure, the thirst for discovery, burned just as brightly in her heart as it had in Thomas's.
