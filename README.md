
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested their mettle.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – negotiating with suspicious villagers, fording raging rivers, and always, the looming specter of starvation.  Their only companions were their worn horses, their unwavering faith, and the whispered legends of the saints that fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cutting a lonely path through the cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar space, Eva pressed onward, driven by a stubborn hope and the knowledge that the fate of humanity might rest on her shoulders.  The vastness of space was a far cry from the familiar plains of medieval Europe, but the human spirit of adventure remained unchanged.
