
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the rough-spun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she guides her weary mule across the sun-baked plains of Provence.  The scent of rosemary and thyme mingles with the ever-present tang of sweat and fear.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Alexandria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, but the hope of healing fuels her onward, one aching step at a time.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to persevere.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby, broken only by the crackle of comms and the occasional alert from the navigation system.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a desperate gamble to save a dying civilization from a cosmic plague.  The dangers are less tangible than Elara's – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present loneliness of space – but no less deadly.  The vast, indifferent cosmos stretches before her, a canvas of swirling nebulas and distant suns, each a potential hazard, each a potential key to success.
