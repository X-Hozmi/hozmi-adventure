
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and untold riches, guarded by treacherous mountains and even more treacherous bandits.  His meager supplies dwindled with each day, the weight of his hopes, and the fear of the unknown, pressing down as heavily as his saddlebags. Each creak of his steed, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or death.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Ahead lay not bandits and mountains, but cosmic radiation storms and the chilling possibility of encountering alien life – both benevolent and hostile. The journey, a gamble of unimaginable scale, promised scientific discovery, untold riches, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars.
