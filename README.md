
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the brutal war ravaging the kingdom.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of glory and the hope of peace fueled their weary bodies and resolute hearts, driving them ever closer to their mythical destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly alien predators.  Warp jumps between galaxies were risky, each one a gamble against spatial anomalies and unforeseen celestial events.  Yet, the knowledge that her cargo held the key to the colony's survival, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories, spurred her onward, a lone voyager in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
