
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Elara, had already claimed two of their number to sickness and exhaustion.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering faith in their hearts, coupled with the allure of the legendary shrine’s healing powers, spurred them onward through the unforgiving medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was imminent.  Despite the advanced technology at her fingertips, the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life.  But the potential discovery of a new home for humanity, a new cradle of civilization, made the unimaginable risks worthwhile.
