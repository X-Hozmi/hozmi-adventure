
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present dangers of hyperspace jumps tested Ryla's skills and courage to their limits, the vastness of the galaxy a daunting yet thrilling arena for her daring expedition.
