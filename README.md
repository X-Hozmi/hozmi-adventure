
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel, containing little more than dried fruit and a chipped flint, felt heavy with the weight of her quest – to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each flickering campfire represented a potential ally or enemy on this perilous journey through war-torn lands.  Survival, not comfort, dictated her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers, Rexx felt the familiar thrill of danger in the cold vacuum of space. Unlike medieval pilgrims, he had technology on his side, but the vastness of the cosmos and the unpredictable nature of alien encounters presented a challenge as daunting as any medieval battlefield.
