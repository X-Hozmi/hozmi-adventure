
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold powerful healing herbs.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the ever-present threat of unforeseen peril.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses and fueled her determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating the treacherous currents of space, dodging pirate vessels and encountering alien civilizations both friendly and hostile, was a far cry from the dangers of medieval travel, but the underlying principle remained the same: perseverance in the face of the unknown, driven by a purpose larger than oneself.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, held a terrifying emptiness that tested the crew's courage and resolve as they leaped from star system to star system, a flicker of hope against the endless expanse of the cosmos.
