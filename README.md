
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the Spine of the Dragon mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between me and my destination – the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for my brother's illness. Bandits, treacherous passes, and ravenous wolves were but small prices to pay for the hope that flickered in my chest, a tiny spark against the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a quiet victory in the face of such a perilous journey.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's warp drive was a constant companion, a comforting vibration against the cold void of intergalactic space.  My mission: to retrieve the Xylos crystals from the Kepler-186f system, a vital component in the galaxy's fragile energy grid.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading Kryll pirate ships, and braving the unstable wormholes were mere inconveniences compared to the weight of responsibility I carried.  The breathtaking nebulae, swirling colours painting the darkness, were a stunning, yet humbling reminder of the vastness of the universe and the incredible distances I traversed to ensure the survival of my people.
