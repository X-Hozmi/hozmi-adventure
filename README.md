
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a patchwork of humans and beasts, creaked across the sun-baked plains.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforeseen terrors of the untamed wilderness.  We sought the mythical City of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and power.  The journey tested our strength, our courage, and the very bonds of our fellowship, forging us into something stronger, something more resilient than any single soul could be alone.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  My hyperdrive sputters as we jump between galaxies, the swirling nebulas painting a cosmic masterpiece beyond the viewport.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The dangers are less bandits and more rogue asteroids, gravity wells that threaten to swallow us whole, and the ever-present threat of piracy from rival corporations. But the allure of discovery, the promise of pushing humanity's boundaries further than ever before, fuels our journey across the unimaginable vastness of space.
