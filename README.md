
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine.  She was bound for Avignon, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the very terrain itself threatened with treacherous ravines and unpredictable weather. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns, spurred her onward. The adventure, though fraught with hardship, promised a treasure beyond gold.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold steel of his ship.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold a powerful energy source capable of jump-starting a dying galaxy. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were merely Tuesday for Razor, but the unknown dangers lurking on Kepler-186f, whispered in the galactic cantinas, were a different beast entirely.  This interstellar voyage promised riches and glory, but more importantly, the chance to save countless lives.
