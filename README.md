
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the harsh landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey, testing her courage and resilience. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with both promise and peril. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers in their heavily armed freighters, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking vistas, but the journey was fraught with danger, demanding both skill and unwavering nerve.
