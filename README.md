
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow sharp in the thin air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little comfort against the looming threat of bandits or the unpredictable wrath of nature.  Each creaking step forward was a gamble, a desperate hope for reaching the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential reward fueled her onward, one perilous mile at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the ship's navigation system.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, potentially catapulting them into gravitational anomalies or hostile alien territory. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery and perhaps even salvation, spurred them on across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
