
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary steed as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat and a chipped map, her only companions the relentless sun and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled her onward. This journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, promised untold riches, or a swift and brutal end.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of her starship's trail a stark contrast against the cosmic canvas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from her home world. The journey was a calculated risk, a gamble against the uncharted dangers of hyperspace and the unpredictable nature of alien encounters.  The promise of new life, new resources, and the expansion of human civilization outweighed the peril.  With a steady hand, she charted a course through the glittering abyss, ready to confront whatever the universe threw her way.
