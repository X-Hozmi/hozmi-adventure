
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I trudged across the snow-covered Bavarian Alps, the biting wind a constant companion.  My meager pack held little besides dried meat, a waterskin, and the worn map leading me to the legendary lost monastery of St. Gall.  Each mountain pass was a gamble, each valley a potential ambush by bandits or worse.  But the whispered tales of ancient texts and untold riches fueled my journey, making the hardship worthwhile, at least for now.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The shimmering nebulae outside our viewport painted a breathtaking backdrop to the immense risk.  Pirate raids were a constant threat, and the unknown dangers of uncharted space loomed larger than any earthly mountain.  But the potential reward – the mastery of interstellar travel – was a prize worth risking everything for.
