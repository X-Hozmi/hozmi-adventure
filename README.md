
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme battling the stench of sweat and fear.  Her quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new peril; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward, transforming each arduous mile into a step closer to salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as she navigated uncharted nebulae and dodged rogue asteroid fields. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Cosmic radiation pulsed against the ship's hull, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of space. But Ryla, fueled by the survival of her people, pressed onward, each jump a gamble, each star a potential beacon of hope.
