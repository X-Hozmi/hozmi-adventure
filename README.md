Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, squinted at the horizon.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Sunstone city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred him onward, a beacon in the bleak landscape of his adventure.

The journey had already claimed lives and tested their ship to its limits, pitted against rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, pressed on, driven by a thirst for discovery and the hope of ushering in a new era for humanity, one where the stars are not just distant points of light, but reachable destinations.
