
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald’s warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of France, a worn map clutched in his gauntlet.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fuels his journey, pushing him ever onward through the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hum, and the vastness of space presses in on her crew.  The dangers are different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure. But the human spirit, just as in Reginald's time, drives her across the uncharted cosmic seas, fueled by a desperate hope for reunion and survival.
