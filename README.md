
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the only sound the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing Lady Isolde.  Days bled into weeks, fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the nebula decades ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging cosmic anomalies was commonplace. The loneliness of interstellar travel was far more perilous than any space pirate,  but Eva pushed forward fueled by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the mystery behind the colony's disappearance, a journey spanning lightyears and demanding courage far beyond the wildest medieval knight's dreams.
