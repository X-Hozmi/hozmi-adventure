
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a perilous route through the Black Forest to the distant kingdom of Eldoria. Rumours of a lost city, brimming with ancient magic and untold riches, fuelled his quest.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching winter.  Survival depended on wit, courage, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with challenges – navigating asteroid fields, dealing with unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels preying on interstellar traders.  Unlike Thomas, Eva possessed advanced technology, but the vastness of space presented its own unique terrors, demanding both technical expertise and unwavering nerve.  The promise of a new world, a new beginning, spurred her onwards, a parallel to Thomas's ancient dream.
