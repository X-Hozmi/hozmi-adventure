
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Their journey to the distant port city of Marseille was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed them like a malevolent phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of the sea, and the escape it promised, spurred her onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a dance with gravity wells and rogue asteroids, the vastness of space both beautiful and terrifying.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light-years of empty void.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.  The reward, however, was the potential discovery of a new life-giving resource – a necessity for a galaxy on the brink of collapse.
