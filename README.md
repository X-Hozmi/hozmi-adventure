
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s worn leather boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hanging heavy in the air.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Ys, had taken her through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen by spring rains, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests where bandits lurked. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for food and shelter with wary villagers, and constantly watching her back for the ever-present threat of violence.  The legends promised untold riches and a glimpse of the divine, a reward worth risking everything to obtain.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa “Storm” Vashti steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the perils of unpredictable wormholes and hostile space pirates.  Advanced technology eased some burdens – hyperdrive jumps shortened the vast distances, shields protected against meteor showers – but the vastness of space held its own unique terrors.  The loneliness, the constant threat of system malfunctions, and the sheer weight of responsibility for the lives entrusted to her fueled a different, yet equally potent, kind of adventure.
