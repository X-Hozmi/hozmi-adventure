
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Anatolian plateau.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the relentless heat baking the land, and the constant gnawing fear of disease.  Yet, the whispers of the Silk Road, of fabled cities and potent spices, fueled her journey.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, worn and faded, was her only guide, a promise of adventure and perhaps, fortune, amidst the hardships of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to the vast emptiness of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the dangers remained: unpredictable stellar flares, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors leading to desolate, uncharted sectors. Yet, the promise of discovery, of encountering new life and unravelling cosmic mysteries, made every risk worthwhile.
