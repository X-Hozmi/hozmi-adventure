
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth fought with the stench of mud and sweat clinging to his traveling companions.  Their journey across the breadth of France, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine, had tested their mettle. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies had chipped away at their resolve, but the whispered promise of divine healing spurred them on.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset the gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her multi-species crew, a vibrant tapestry of human, Kryll, and Vashta, worked with practiced efficiency as the ship navigated the treacherous gravitational currents.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey fraught with peril from unpredictable space storms to the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held them captive until their destination was reached, a gamble against the odds for the survival of a distant world.
