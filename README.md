
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and meager rations.  The journey to Avignon, to deliver a vital message to the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Banditry was rampant, and the whispers of the Black Death loomed larger than any castle wall.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of fear through her, yet the urgency of her mission spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth, was a routine patrol, but the vastness of space held its own terrors.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers all demanded vigilance.  But Eva, her eyes fixed on the shimmering emerald planet ahead, felt the thrill of exploration pulse in her veins, a legacy of those medieval adventurers who dared to chart unknown territories, only hers was a cosmic map rather than a parchment scroll.
