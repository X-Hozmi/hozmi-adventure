
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, was treacherous, choked with mud and fallen timber.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine, the whispers of bandits and wild beasts a constant threat.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril, promising riches or ruin, glory or a nameless grave in the unforgiving wilderness.  He pressed on, spurred by duty and a flicker of desperate hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space held both wonder and immense danger.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the chilling silence of the cosmos.  Her mission: to establish a new colony, a risky venture for humanity's future, a voyage that could secure a legacy or condemn them to the cold oblivion of space.
