
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, spurred his destrier onwards.  Ahead, the treacherous Black Forest loomed, a tapestry of shadow and rumour.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Aquitaine, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter.  Each day brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and outwitting cunning thieves.  His survival depended not only on his skill with a sword, but on his resilience and the kindness of strangers along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey across light-years that would test the limits of both ship and crew.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling supplies was their daily bread.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva pressed on, driven by the hope of finding her missing kin and unraveling the mysteries of the galaxy.
