
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, dust-caked and sun-baked, trudged onward, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before us like a sun-scorched tapestry.  Our destination:  the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagon, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent shivers down our spines, fueled by tales of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the plague.  The journey was arduous, a constant battle against the elements and the unknown, but the lure of the legendary city spurred us onwards.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we hurtled across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebulae outside, guided our vessel towards Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, was our constant companion.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards – a new home, new possibilities – outweighed the risks.
