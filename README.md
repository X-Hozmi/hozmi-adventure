
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a parchment sealed with crimson wax, burned a hole in his saddlebag – a quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the secret to a plague sweeping the land.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dense forest, held the promise of both wonder and peril; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were as real as the distant, shimmering peaks that hinted at Eldoria's existence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting drone against the vast, silent expanse of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, showing the treacherous asteroid fields and volatile gravitational currents they'd have to navigate.  The promise of a new beginning for humanity was a powerful incentive, outweighing the ever-present danger of cosmic radiation, engine failure, and the unknown horrors lurking in the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
