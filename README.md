
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she urged her weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless expanse of the French countryside, each rise revealing not a welcoming town but another stretch of unforgiving landscape.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon – felt as endless as the road itself. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, yet the fire of duty burned brighter than any hardship.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath, was a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Faster-than-light travel had erased the limitations of distance, yet the journey was fraught with its own unique dangers.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of pirate attacks, and the psychological toll of months spent traversing the cosmos tested her crew and their ship to its limits. The reward, however – the possibility of discovering new life and expanding humanity's reach among the stars – was a siren song too compelling to ignore.
