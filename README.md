
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map – a treasure more valuable than gold in this perilous journey to Constantinople. Bandits, disease, and the unpredictable weather were constant threats, but the lure of the fabled Silk Road, and the promise of untold riches and exotic spices, spurred her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – or disaster.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The vast expanse of space, speckled with glittering stars and menacing black holes, was a terrifying but breathtaking frontier.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with danger – a single miscalculation could send them hurtling into a supernova or a rift in spacetime. Yet, the unknown, the thrill of discovery, and the weight of humanity's future rested on her capable shoulders, making the risks a small price to pay.
