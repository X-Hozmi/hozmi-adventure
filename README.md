
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered retinue crested the pass, the wind whipping at their worn cloaks.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a legend whispered in hushed tones at every campfire.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, making their journey a desperate dance between survival and hope.

Millennia later, Captain Elara’s starship, *Stardust*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding hostile alien patrols, and troubleshooting malfunctioning warp drives were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of peril than the Black Mire – the crushing loneliness of infinite distances and the ever-present possibility of encountering something utterly beyond human comprehension.
