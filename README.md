
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to retrieve the lost scroll of Eldoria, rumored to hold the key to ending a devastating plague.  Each day brought new perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the scroll, and the hope it represented, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vastness of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of warp travel were all in a day's work.  The vast distances between star systems, the alien landscapes of unexplored planets, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile species made every journey a gamble, but for Eva, the potential rewards far outweighed the risk – a chance to bring untold prosperity to her people.
