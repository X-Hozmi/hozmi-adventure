
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a perilous pilgrimage to the Holy Land, tested both their faith and their endurance.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for supplies in hostile villages, and facing down the endless monotony of the road. Yet, the whispered tales of Jerusalem, the promise of salvation, spurred them onward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable cosmic wonders.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling solar flares, and repairing vital systems under the pressure of deep space became her daily routine.  The solitude was profound, the risks immense, but the allure of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of the universe, fueled her relentless pursuit of the unknown.
