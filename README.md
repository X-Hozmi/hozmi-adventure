
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows that danced with the whispers of fear.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's shimmering spires and healing waters fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's AI.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital mineral from the K'tharr system, a journey spanning light years and fraught with peril.  Rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace all posed significant threats. But the reward – securing their planet's energy supply – outweighed the risks, pushing Rexa and her crew to the limits of their endurance and technological prowess.
