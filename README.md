
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains in fiery hues. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – treacherous passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and the unknown.  But the glimmer of hope, the whispered tales of Eldoria's healing powers, fuel his weary body and embolden his spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a thrill that rivals any medieval knight's.  The journey to the Kepler-186f colony is fraught with peril, from unpredictable wormholes to the ever-present danger of pirate attacks. Yet, the vast expanse of space, the breathtaking celestial displays, and the promise of a new life on a terraformed planet offer a reward greater than any treasure a medieval adventurer could hope to find. The cosmos awaits, a boundless canvas for the bold.
