
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the muddy track a treacherous ribbon cutting through the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagons, each cough of our horses, echoed the perilous nature of our journey across the ravaged kingdom.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, starvation stalked us across barren plains, and the whispers of plague rode the wind.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, propelled us forward, a flickering beacon in the endless night.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway. The crimson dust of Xylos still clung to the hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' as we warped towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae, dodging rogue asteroids, and evading the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirates, was a far cry from the mud and bandits of old, but the thrill remained the same.  The pursuit of the mythical 'Aetherium', a substance capable of bending spacetime, fueled our daring expedition, a quest as perilous as any undertaken in the age of kings and knights, yet played out against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.
