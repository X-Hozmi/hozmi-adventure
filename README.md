
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a risky trade but her only hope of reaching her ailing brother in Constantinople.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry or worse – the Black Death stalked the land, a shadow even more menacing than the brigands who lurked in the mountain passes.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, punctuated by the kindness of strangers and the breathtaking beauty of untamed landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic dust and vibrant gas clouds.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The journey, while technologically advanced, was no less perilous.  Unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions made every jump a gamble.  But the thrill of exploration, the vastness of the cosmos, and the knowledge she was pushing the boundaries of human understanding spurred her onward.
