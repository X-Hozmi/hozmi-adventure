
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a chipped flint, and the map – a tattered, almost illegible scroll – promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse, yet the desperate hope spurred her on through the deepening twilight.  The adventure was perilous, the path uncertain, but the potential reward infinitely valuable.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova"  Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula painted across the void like cosmic watercolor.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory scavengers that lurked between the stars was a constant battle against the unforgiving expanse of space.  But the lure of galactic exploration, of charting unmapped territories and unveiling the universe's secrets, burned brighter than any sun, fueling their daring journey across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
