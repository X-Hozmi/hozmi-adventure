
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to me, a familiar perfume on this pilgrimage across the fractured kingdoms.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, whispered tales of dragons guarded mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked our weary caravan. Yet, the promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon, spurred us onward, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars blurred into streaks of cosmic paint as we hurtled towards the Xylos system, a journey measured not in leagues but lightyears.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from worlds both familiar and alien, monitored the ship's systems, their faces illuminated by the ethereal glow of the control panels.  The dangers were different now—cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien life—but the thrill of discovery, the uncharted territories, burned as brightly as any medieval adventurer's dream.
