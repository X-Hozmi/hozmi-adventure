He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, disease clinging to the air like a shroud, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

While danger loomed in the form of asteroid fields and unknown space anomalies, the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover new life and expand humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her relentless pursuit of the unknown.
