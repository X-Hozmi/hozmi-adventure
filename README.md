
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat mud-caked and his horse weary, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of travel had brought him across treacherous mountain passes, through sun-baked deserts, and past whispering forests haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – skirmishes with bandits, fording raging rivers, navigating dense, unfamiliar woodlands, the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  The journey itself was as arduous and unpredictable as the legends he sought.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey spanning light-years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Navigating hyperspace was a constant dance with gravitational anomalies and unknown spatial distortions;  each jump a gamble.  The crew faced down hostile alien encounters, dealt with malfunctioning equipment, and endured the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The vast emptiness of space presented a different kind of hardship than the medieval traveler's, but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned just as brightly within her.
