
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's writ, a crumpled parchment clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches and glory in the distant East.  But the path was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the whispers of plague-ridden towns chilled him to the bone.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in his grueling journey across a continent teeming with both beauty and brutality.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the vessel to its limits, but the promise of the legendary Xylos crystals, capable of powering faster-than-light travel, was too tempting to resist.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders were just another day's work for Eva and her crew,  their journey a testament to humanity’s relentless exploration across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
