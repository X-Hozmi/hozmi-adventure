
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, fording icy streams on foot, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  But the lure of the sacred shrine, and the whispered promise of miraculous healing, spurred them ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional shimmering supernova or the eerie silence between stars, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Facing down asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life forms, the crew of the *Odyssey* pressed on, driven by the insatiable human need to explore the boundless cosmos.
