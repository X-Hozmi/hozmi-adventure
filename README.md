
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each whispered rumour in a smoky tavern, was a step closer to or further from her desperate hope. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all hurdles in her perilous journey across a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace lever, the swirling nebulae outside his starship a kaleidoscope of cosmic wonder. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying isolation and the thrilling promise of discovery, as Rexx charted a course through the uncharted territories of the galaxy, driven by hope and the ever-present pull of the unknown.
