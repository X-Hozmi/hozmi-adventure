
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to his family's lost fortune.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of forgotten magic and untold riches, spurred him relentlessly forward,  a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving backdrop of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the perils of cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile spacefaring civilizations.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars, ignited her with a spirit of fearless exploration, a legacy of the medieval adventurers who dared to dream beyond their horizons, now writ large upon the canvas of the cosmos.
