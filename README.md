
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for both wonder and peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, yet the promise of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, fuels her onward.  The journey is brutal, but the whispered legends of its exotic riches and untold wisdom make it worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Starfall" Valerius pilots her starship *Seraphina* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the unmapped Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby, masking the deafening silence of interstellar space. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances, fraught with the risk of encountering rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, or worse – a void so absolute that escape is impossible.  But the allure of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and new technologies eclipses any fear; the cosmos awaits, beckoning her to explore its endless mysteries.
