
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's wasting sickness.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, the vastness of the medieval world both terrifying and exhilarating.  Every ford crossed, every forest traversed, brought them closer to their uncertain destiny.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey through uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate attacks was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unknown, the vast emptiness between stars threatening to swallow them whole.  With a crew of hardened spacefarers at her side, Eva relied on her wits, her ship's advanced technology, and a deep-seated sense of hope to guide her across the cosmic ocean, towards a future that remained unwritten.
