
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril and hope, a test of endurance and loyalty against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing warp drive malfunctions were all part of a typical voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered unparalleled adventure, a constant push against the boundaries of human exploration, forging a new era of interstellar pioneers.
