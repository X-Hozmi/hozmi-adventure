
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guides her towards the mythical city of Ys.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispering winds carry tales of monstrous beasts and treacherous swamps. Yet, the lure of Ys, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and secrets, fuels her relentless journey, each sunrise a new gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the inky blackness towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation relies not on crumbling maps but on intricate star charts and complex astrogation systems, yet the dangers are no less real.  Uncharted nebulae threaten to swallow the ship whole, while hostile alien races patrol the void between stars.  The quest for the legendary Xylos planet, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace, pushes Ryla and her crew to the very edge of endurance, a voyage that tests their courage and their technology in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.
