
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was arduous, fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, the terrain shifted from treacherous mountain passes to scorching deserts, and whispers of a plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a desperate prayer for survival – yet the lure of the Sultan's rumored treasure, and the glory awaiting a knight who dared such a journey, propelled him ever forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a gut-wrenching experience, the stars blurring into streaks of impossible color.  Beyond the thrill of interstellar travel lay the ever-present threat of pirate ships, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the unknown dangers of a planet light-years from home.  But the potential rewards – not just energy, but knowledge of a previously undiscovered alien civilization – fueled her unwavering resolve.
