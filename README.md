
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mud.  Her journey across the breadth of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every creaking mile, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on.  The whispered tales of the fabled city of Samarkand, its silks and spices, fueled her determination to overcome the hardships and reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the inky blackness of hyperspace.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant lullaby, punctuated by the crackle of the comm-system.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and potentially teeming with alien life, both friendly and hostile. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a different kind of danger – unforeseen gravitational anomalies, pirate fleets lurking in nebulae, and the ever-present risk of encountering civilizations far more advanced (or less).  But the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity’s reach, dwarfed all fear.
