
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenean landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical city of Ys, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her edges. Yet, the whisper of legend, the promise of untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the aggressive patrols of the Kryll Hegemony was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape awaiting her on the other side.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to unlock a new era of interstellar exploration, fuelled her insatiable thirst for the unknown, a modern-day adventurer charting a course across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
