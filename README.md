
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he spurred it onward, the relentless sun beating down on his worn leather armor.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send him tumbling to his death, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease stalked his every step. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, testing his courage and resilience as he traversed the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take years even at near-light speed.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all part of a day's work.  The vast, empty expanse of space offered a stark contrast to the close confines of her ship, the weight of responsibility and the loneliness of interstellar travel a constant companion on this daring expedition across the cosmos.
