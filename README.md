
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and treacherous mountain passes, past bustling market towns and desolate, bandit-infested forests.  Each day brought new challenges – from navigating treacherous river crossings to bartering for scarce provisions in isolated hamlets. The allure of the sacred destination spurred them onward, but the adventure of the journey itself, with its constant uncertainty and breathtaking landscapes, was its own reward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking involving wormhole navigation and encounters with unknown alien civilizations.  The vastness of space, peppered with vibrant nebulas and the faint, distant light of billions of stars, dwarfed the challenges faced by terrestrial explorers of old.  Yet the spirit of adventure remained the same – a thirst for the unknown, a willingness to risk everything for the sake of discovery, the exhilaration of pushing boundaries that seemed insurmountable.
