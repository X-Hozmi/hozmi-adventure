
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack mules and weary men, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, the relentless heat sapping our strength, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, promising silks finer than spun moonlight and spices that ignited the soul, pushed us onward.  We faced the unknown with a mixture of fear and exhilaration, knowing that each sunrise brought us closer to the wonders and dangers that awaited.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship humming with the energy of a collapsing star, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable world light-years from Earth.  While we lack the immediate physical perils of bandits and disease, the vastness of space presents its own terrifying uncertainties: unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering alien life – both benevolent and malevolent.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home amidst the cosmic tapestry, fuels our relentless journey through the inky blackness.
