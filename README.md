
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, empty plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed on.  Their destination: the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, their journey a tapestry woven with threads of hardship and hope, fueled by the whispered legends of untold riches and forgotten magic.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, flung across the Andromeda galaxy centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and the ever-present danger of alien encounters.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before them, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each star a potential beacon – or a deadly trap.
