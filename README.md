
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the dusty track as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and treacherous mountain passes were merely obstacles on her path; the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, spurred her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each rise and fall of the landscape, was a step further into the heart of a legend.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light-years away across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and deciphering alien signals were all in a day's work for Comet and his crew.  The vastness of space, filled with both terrifying beauty and untold dangers, was their playground, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the thrilling unknown.
