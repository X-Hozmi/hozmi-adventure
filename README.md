Their mission: to find the elusive source of a powerful energy signature, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel without the limitations of warp drive. The journey was filled with unknown dangers, but the allure of groundbreaking scientific discovery and the chance to rewrite the laws of space travel propelled them forward.
