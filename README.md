
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him through the mud and mire, across rivers swollen with spring rains, towards the unknown.  The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple, a breathtaking spectacle that momentarily distracted him from the gnawing hunger in his belly.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-regenerative technology to the ravaged colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey spanned light years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unpredictable gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and distant suns, both awed and intimidated her.  Despite the sophisticated technology at her fingertips, the raw, untamed power of the cosmos demanded respect – a constant reminder that even in the future, adventure was fraught with peril, and the unknown held both incredible wonder and terrifying potential.
