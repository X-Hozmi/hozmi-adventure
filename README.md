
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his mount onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, propelled him ever forward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling Galactic Federation.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate gangs was anything but.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes of distant planets, and the constant threat of unknown dangers presented an adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of any medieval knight.  Yet, like Reginald, Eva faced the unknown with courage and determination, fueled by the same human desire for discovery and a thirst for the extraordinary.
