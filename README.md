
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Ys, a city of unimaginable riches and beauty, fueled her onward, a flickering ember against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable world light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space was a different kind of fear, a cold, impersonal threat countered only by the humming engines and the camaraderie of her crew.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer, yet the thrill of discovery, the potential to uncover new life and civilizations,  outweighed the risks a thousandfold.
