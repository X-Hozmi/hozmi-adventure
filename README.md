
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack mules and weary travelers, wound its way through the unforgiving French countryside.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of disease.  Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheels and each breathtaking vista of rolling hills, a thrilling sense of adventure spurred us onward. We sought not gold, but the rumored lost city of Ys, a legendary place whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires.  The journey itself, with its perils and unexpected kindnesses, became as valuable as the destination.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' hummed a low song as it pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  We chased whispers of a pre-galactic civilization, their technology lost to the eons but rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, the stunning beauty of nebulae, and the chilling silence between stars were constants, but the potential discoveries, the alien landscapes, and the thrill of the chase kept the crew of the 'Stardust Drifter' pushing forward, against all odds.
