
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new river to ford, each testing her courage and resilience.  The whispered legends of the lost city of Zerzura fueled her onward, a shimmering beacon in the harsh reality of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle, but the vastness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable wormholes, pirate raids from the Kryll Confederacy, and the constant gnawing loneliness of interstellar exploration.  The quest for the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy, drove her across galaxies, each jump a gamble, each alien world a potential treasure trove or deadly trap.
