The sun beat down on the dusty track, the scent of pine and damp earth a poor consolation for the gnawing hunger in his belly.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promised both peril and the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.
