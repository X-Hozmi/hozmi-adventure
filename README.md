
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke clinging to the crisp air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, the promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for both peril and discovery, for bandits, wild beasts, or the unexpected kindness of a stranger.  The journey was arduous, but the unknown beckoned with irresistible allure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the ship's bridge.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a feat that promised untold riches and scientific breakthroughs for the Sol Federation. But the uncharted territory was riddled with hazards – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets lurking in the shadows.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, held an equally immense and terrifying unknown.
