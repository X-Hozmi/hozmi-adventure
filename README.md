
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's boots as she trudges across the parched plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The journey to Constantinople feels endless, a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of sun-baked earth and the looming threat of bandits. Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and constantly watching the horizon for signs of danger.  The allure of the fabled city, however, fuels her onward, a beacon in a sea of uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa “Sparks” Mallory pilots the starship *Stardust Wanderer*, a speck of defiance against the infinite expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The journey is punctuated by the hum of hyperdrive engines, the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling like cosmic paintstrokes, and the ever-present fear of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien life.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast unknown, propelled by the hope of finding a new home amongst the stars.
