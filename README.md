
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the allure of the distant cathedral, a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in hardship, spurred her onward.  The road was long, arduous, and uncertain, but the spirit of adventure burned bright within her.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and unseen dangers, dwarfed her tiny ship.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  But the potential reward – a new home for humanity – fueled her unwavering courage, transforming the perils of interstellar travel into exhilarating chapters in a grand, cosmic adventure.
