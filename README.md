
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had already tested her mettle. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, the glimmer of the unknown, the promise of ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky black of interstellar space.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity's sprawling galactic empire.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and managing the temperamental warp drive were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, held both wonder and peril. The adventure was not just about discovery, but survival in a cosmos teeming with the unknown.
