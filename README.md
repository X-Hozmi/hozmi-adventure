
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it held the hopes of her family, entrusted to her safekeeping as she journeyed to the distant port city of Marseille.  Bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to halt her journey entirely, but the promise of a better life spurred her onward. Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages, and facing the ever-present fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with unmapped cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The ship hummed with the energy of its Alcubierre drive, a stark contrast to the creaking wagons and weary horses of Elara's time.  Yet, the fundamental human spirit remained – the courage to face the unknown, the unwavering determination to reach a destination, the enduring hope for a better future, whether across a medieval kingdom or the vast expanse of the cosmos.
