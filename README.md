
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – seeds of a rumored miracle crop that could save her starving village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, carries the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, wild animals, and the relentless sun are constant threats, yet the hope of sustenance fuels her onward, making every aching muscle a testament to her unwavering resolve. This arduous journey is a gamble with fate, but the potential reward makes it a worthy risk.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', her course charted for the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a lullaby, a counterpoint to the breathtaking nebulae painting the viewport.  Her mission: to locate a fabled planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the vastness of space is a treacherous ocean, filled with uncharted anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  The challenges are far removed from Elara's, yet the courage, the unwavering pursuit of a distant goal, connects them across millennia.
