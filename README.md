
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of cultures he’d traversed – from the bustling marketplaces of Constantinople to the silent, snow-dusted peaks of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones across taverns and campfires, fuelled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant dance with unpredictable wormholes and hostile space debris, a far cry from the charted routes of Earth's solar system.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, faced the perils of alien lifeforms, equipment malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation. But the promise of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach beyond the cradle of its birth, propelled them forward into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
