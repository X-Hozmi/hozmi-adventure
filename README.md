
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's hopes, a desperate journey to the rumored emerald mines of the far north. Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous trek, but the gleam of potential wealth, a chance at a better life, fueled her onward.  Each creak of the wagon, each sunrise, was a testament to their resilience in the face of medieval hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold a source of energy capable of jumpstarting galactic civilization. The journey was a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels.  But the potential reward, the hope of a brighter future for all, outweighed the risks for Rexx and his crew, each jump through hyperspace a gamble toward a new tomorrow.
