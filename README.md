
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, brittle scroll containing a secret map – the key to a lost monastery rumored to hold ancient knowledge.  Wolves howl in the distance, a constant reminder of the perils facing her; bandits, starvation, and the harsh elements are just as dangerous as any mythical beast.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience as she pushes ever closer to her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx strides across the bridge of the 'Starseeker', a colossal vessel capable of warping across galaxies.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess a unique energy source capable of solving the Galactic Federation's looming energy crisis.  But the journey is fraught with unseen hazards – treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space itself is a daunting opponent, but the reward promises to shape the future of countless civilizations, driving Rexx and his crew onward despite the immeasurable risks.
