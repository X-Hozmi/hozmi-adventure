
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, detailing a rumored shortcut to the fabled city of Zerzura, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of adrenaline through her, a stark counterpoint to the breathtaking vista of snow-capped peaks and shadowed valleys unfolding before her.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart, but the promise of Zerzura, and the secrets it held, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal engines of the 'Stardust Drifter' humming a low thrum against the silence of space.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across galaxies was measured not in days, but in weeks of hyperspace jumps, punctuated by the tense moments of navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders.  The vastness of the cosmos, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, pressed in on Jax, a constant reminder of the immense risks and the potentially limitless rewards of their perilous expedition.
