
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zamora, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed passes, and the unpredictable weather threatened to bury her alive in snow.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the allure of Zamora, and the secrets it promised, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, where a wrong calculation could result in being lost forever among the stars.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar unity, a journey that demanded not only navigational skill, but also the courage to face the unknown, and perhaps, the unimaginable.
