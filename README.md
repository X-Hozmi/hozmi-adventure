
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track as he and his small band traversed the unforgiving landscape, their destination the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of horse was a testament to the grueling journey; bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies were constant companions on this perilous quest for glory and fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Elara's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint glimmer of quasars and the whispers of hyperspace, her crew charted a course to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the allure of discovery and the potential to revolutionize interstellar travel fueled their unwavering determination.
