
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and a dwindling supply of dried figs.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the scrub, promised either salvation or peril – bandits, scorching sunstroke, or the treacherous shifting sands themselves threatened to derail her quest for the mythical city.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fueled her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its multi-hued gases a breathtaking, if slightly nauseating, spectacle.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy crystal from the ice planet of Nird, a perilous undertaking even for a seasoned spacer like himself.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling crippling radiation were all just another day's work. But the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery – the chance to bring back something that could power entire star systems – made the risks worthwhile, even if they meant navigating the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
