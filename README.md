
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each sunrise revealed new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of overcoming hardship, pushed him ever closer to his elusive goal, the vast, unpredictable landscape his only companion.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take years, traversing wormholes and dodging asteroid fields.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced not only the dangers of the cosmos but also the psychological strain of prolonged isolation, their courage tested against the awe-inspiring beauty and unrelenting hazards of interstellar travel.
