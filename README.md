
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the midday heat shimmering above the parched earth.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and whispers of monstrous beasts echoed through the desolate landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, crossing raging rivers, and bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages – but the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, fueled by the promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage that would test the limits of both her ship and her courage.  The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and terror – the unpredictable gravitational pulls of celestial bodies, the risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure, all loomed larger than any medieval bandit.  Yet, the boundless expanse beckoned, a thrilling frontier ripe for exploration.
