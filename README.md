
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains a fiery red. Her journey, a perilous pilgrimage to the mythical Sunken City, had already claimed two of her companions.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the whispers of untold riches and forgotten magic spurred her onward, fueling her determination against the crushing weight of fatigue and fear.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa’s starship *Stardust* leaped through the void, a tiny speck against the breathtaking tapestry of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, rumored to harbor a new source of faster-than-light energy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was a daily occurrence.  The crew faced not only the perils of space but the psychological toll of months spent light-years from home, bound together by the shared dream of discovery and the hope of returning to tell their tale.
