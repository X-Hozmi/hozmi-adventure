The dusty track wound through a landscape as unforgiving as the rumors whispered about the Black Mire – their destination.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort of his horse, punctuated the silence broken only by the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  Ahead lay danger, perhaps death, but also the legendary Sword of Aethelred, an artifact whispered to hold the power to vanquish the encroaching shadowlands.  His journey was a gamble, a desperate race against time and the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, pushing the limits of their experimental hyperdrive, but the promise of a new, habitable world for humanity was a reward worth the unimaginable peril.  Cosmic rays crackled against the hull, a constant reminder of the vast, indifferent universe surrounding them.  Eva gripped the controls, her heart pounding a rhythm against the low hum of the ship, praying their calculations were correct and that they wouldn't become another forgotten speck of dust in the cosmic void.
