The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Barony of Eldoria.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the flickering torchlight of his small caravan.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits.

But the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweighed the risks, fueling her unwavering determination to reach the distant shores of a new world.
