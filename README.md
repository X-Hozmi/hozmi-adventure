
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Pyrenees mountains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking step of his horse, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling unknown of the untamed wilderness.  His only companions were his loyal squire and a gnawing hunger for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula known as the Serpent's Eye, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source from the planet Xylos, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by hostile alien lifeforms.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifted subtly, and the endless expanse of stars offered both breathtaking beauty and a constant, low-level threat.  The universe was her battlefield, and the courage of a thousand knights resided within her heart.
