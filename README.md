
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Francia.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map promising riches beyond the whispering mountains.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient magic, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a stark contrast to the chaotic nebula swirling around them. Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Hyperspace jumps were perilous, each a gamble against gravitational anomalies and unseen space debris.  Alien encounters, both benevolent and hostile, were commonplace.  But the promise of a new beginning, a fresh start for her people among the stars, outweighed the risk; a voyage of discovery fuelled by hope and the unyielding human spirit.
