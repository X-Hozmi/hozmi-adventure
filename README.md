
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange. Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, transforming the simple pilgrimage into a perilous adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp jumps across light-years, encounters with hostile alien species, and the constant threat of equipment failure were the hazards of her intergalactic voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a canvas for her daring exploration.
