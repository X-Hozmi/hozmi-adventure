
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing the barely-charted route to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape; each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a hard-won victory. The promise of untold riches and legendary artifacts fueled his relentless pursuit, a siren's call echoing through the desolate plains.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and contending with unpredictable warp fluctuations were commonplace hazards.  The thrill of discovery, the possibility of encountering alien life, and the weight of humanity's future rested on her shoulders as she charted a course through the unmapped expanse of the cosmos, a tiny vessel against the infinite backdrop of space.
