
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged, snow-dusted peaks as Elara, her worn leather jerkin pulled tight, urged her mule onward.  Their journey – a pilgrimage to the mythical healing springs of St. Jude – had taken them through sun-baked valleys, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadowed depths of whispering forests teeming with bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, a constant companion on this arduous, but ultimately rewarding, passage across the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of swirling amethyst and emerald.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage across light-years of cosmic dust and unpredictable gravitational forces.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the hostile K'tharr pirates were just another day's work for Razor and his crew, who embraced the boundless expanse of space, each jump to a new star system a thrilling leap into the breathtaking, and often terrifying, vastness of the future.
