
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of York, a biting wind whipping at our cloaks as we set off for the Holy Land.  Ahead lies a perilous trek across the treacherous Alps, fraught with bandit ambushes and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new landscapes – sun-drenched vineyards in France, the stark beauty of the Italian countryside – but also the constant anxiety of unpredictable weather, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present shadow of war.  Our only companions are our battered packhorses and the unwavering hope of reaching our destination.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a starship the size of a small city, hums beneath our feet as we jump between galaxies, each hyperspace transition a breathtaking plunge into the heart of infinity.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Our mission: to explore, to discover, and to maybe, just maybe, find answers to questions humanity has pondered for millennia.  But the vastness of space holds dangers beyond our comprehension – cosmic anomalies, hostile alien life, and the constant threat of equipment failure – making every journey a gamble with fate.
