
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Their destination:  the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s healing magic spurred them onward, a beacon against the encroaching darkness.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to human resilience against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving disease.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were commonplace hazards, as was the constant threat of system failures in the vast emptiness of space.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting humanity to a galaxy teeming with untold wonders, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean, a journey far more perilous, but ultimately as thrilling and inspiring, as any medieval quest.
