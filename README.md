
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest – to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother – was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested both beast and rider, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the monastery, and the hope it represented, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the newly-discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold untold resources and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling alien infestations were all part of a day's work for Ryla and her crew.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the most ambitious earthly adventures, yet the thirst for discovery burned as bright as any medieval knight's yearning for glory.
