
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the biting wind whipping at her cloak.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered of in taverns and sung of by bards – a city said to hold both unimaginable wealth and terrifying dangers.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey, yet the lure of Eldoria, and the whispered secrets it held, fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each sunset a brush with death.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, navigating the treacherous asteroid field between Xylos and Kepler-186f. His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, shuddered violently as a chunk of space rock grazed the hull.  The journey across the galaxy was fraught with peril – hostile alien patrols, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of engine failure.  But the promise of Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with undiscovered life and potentially valuable resources, made the risk worthwhile.  For Rexx, the cosmos was his medieval battlefield, and the stars, his ever-changing, perilous landscape.
