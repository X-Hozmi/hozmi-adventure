
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand leagues, spurred his destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped at his face, carrying the scent of pine and distant smoke. Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a shimmering jewel whispered about in taverns and hidden amongst crumbling maps.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of Eldoria, of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled his weary bones and spurred him relentlessly forward, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet potentially harboring life.  The journey across the galaxy, though faster than any medieval trek, held its own perils.  Solar flares threatened to fry the ship's systems, rogue asteroids lurked in the void, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space pressed heavily on the crew. But the promise of discovery, of unveiling the secrets of a new world, surpassed all fear, driving the *Stardust Drifter* onwards towards the unknown.
