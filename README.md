
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague sweeping across the land.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, perilous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by hope and the grim knowledge that failure meant death for countless innocents back home.  The journey tested their limits physically and mentally, forging an unbreakable bond between knight and squire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the newly constructed galaxy-spanning hyperspace bridge.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the opportunistic raids of space pirates, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering resolve.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars and nebulas, was as daunting as any medieval landscape, but the promise of a connected galaxy spurred them onward, towards a future where interstellar travel was not just a dream but a reality.
