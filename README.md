
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the blighted moors to reach King Alaric's beleaguered castle had been arduous.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous bogs, and the gnawing hunger had tested his mettle, but the promise of glory and the king's daughter's hand spurred him on. Each sunrise revealed a new challenge, a new landscape to conquer, a testament to the unpredictable and unforgiving nature of medieval travel.  His destination remained a distant shimmering hope against the harsh reality of the road.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve the lost artifact from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light years from the Sol system. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raiders, and battling crippling warp storms were all in a day's work for this seasoned spacefarer.  But the true adventure wasn't in the dangers faced, but the breathtaking vistas of uncharted galaxies, the alien cultures encountered, and the constant push against the boundaries of human exploration. The universe was vast, and she was just beginning to scratch its surface.
