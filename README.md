
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of the English countryside, then the forbidding Alps, and finally the sun-baked, treacherous paths of the Levant.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present fear of disease hung heavier than the dust kicked up by his steed's hooves. Yet, the glint of the promised land, the chance to prove his valor and faith, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted by the stars and a gut feeling stronger than any navigation system.  The journey between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way was fraught with peril: rogue asteroids, solar flares threatening to fry her ship's circuits, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms. But the allure of the rumored lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to humanity's survival, made the impossible voyage worthwhile. The vastness of space, despite its dangers, filled her with an awe that rivaled any medieval knight's courage.
