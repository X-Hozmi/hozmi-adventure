
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the distant spice markets of the East fuels our onward march, a promise of riches and exotic wonders enough to outweigh the hardship and danger. The rhythmic clop of hooves and the shared stories around crackling campfires forge bonds stronger than any castle wall.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out the vast emptiness of intergalactic space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faces a different kind of peril – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, the risk of encountering unknown alien life, and the constant pressure of maintaining the fragile ecosystem of our ship.  But the potential discovery of new life, new technologies, and new worlds outweighs the risks, fueling our journey through the cosmic ocean.
