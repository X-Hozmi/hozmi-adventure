
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and fear thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling village and a vengeful lord.  Each rocky outcrop, each shadowed forest, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the lure of the distant city, whispered of in hushed tones, spurred her onward.  The rhythmic clop of hooves was a counterpoint to the gnawing hunger and the constant vigilance required to survive.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered galaxy, a region whispered to hold ancient alien artifacts and potentially, unimaginable power.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of fear; the unknown, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovery, propelled her forward across the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
