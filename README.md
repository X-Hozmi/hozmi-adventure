
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainty of his journey. The weight of his family’s hopes, along with the meager supplies in his saddlebags, pressed down on him heavier than any mountain.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the relentless pressure of dwindling oxygen supplies pushed her and her crew to their limits.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a chilling indifference to the tiny ship and its brave crew, their fate hanging on the success of their perilous intergalactic voyage.
