
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences compared to the burning desire to fulfill his sacred vow. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unfamiliar terrain, bartering for supplies in strange dialects, and testing the limits of his endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's console.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light years and demanding precise navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty alongside unimaginable dangers, testing not only her piloting skills but also her courage in the face of cosmic unknowns.
