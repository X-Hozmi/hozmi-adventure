
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and silks, was strapped to the packhorse behind him, a tempting prize for the bandits and brigands that plagued the King's Road.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through him.  His journey to the distant port city, a desperate race against time and desperate men, was far from over.  This was a life lived on the edge of a blade, a constant gamble with fate, where the reward for courage could be riches… or a shallow grave.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara Reyes, her weathered face illuminated by the swirling nebula outside her starship's viewport, steered the *Stardust Wanderer* towards the Xylos system.  The jump to hyperspace had been rough, pushing the vessel to its limits, but the promise of the rare Xylossian crystals, vital for powering the new generation of faster-than-light drives, fueled her crew’s unwavering determination.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, and navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unforeseen gravitational anomalies was all part of a day's work for a galaxy-faring explorer.
