
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with treacherous mountain passes, flooded rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise revealed new challenges: navigating dense forests, bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown lurking in the shadows of the ancient world.  His quest, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate desire for redemption, pushed him relentlessly forward, each mile a hard-won victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey wasn't measured in days or weeks, but in cycles of hyperdrive and the slow, agonizing repair of warp-core breaches.  Unlike Reginald, Eva faced dangers invisible to the naked eye: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling silence of interstellar space.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of a new world, fueled her ambition, each jump a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of the cosmos.
