
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in mountain passes, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger that tested her resolve.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's wonders, fueled by hope and fueled by the burning love for her brother, spurred her onward through the unforgiving medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the nebula decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates became her daily routine, the vast emptiness of space both exhilarating and terrifying.  But the possibility of finding survivors, of bringing hope to a lost world, spurred her to push the limits of her ship and her courage, venturing further into the unknown than any human had dared before.
