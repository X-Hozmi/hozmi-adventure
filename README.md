Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed passes, and the unforgiving terrain tested both her and her mount to their limits. Yet, the whispers of a lost city, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onwards. The thrill of the unknown, the test of her courage, and the potential glory fueled her relentless pursuit.

The vastness of the cosmos was a terrifying and exhilarating playground, a stage for her ambition and bravery.
