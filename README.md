
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail was treacherous, a ribbon of mud snaking through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each bend held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild boar, or worse.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of  Montfort, demanded both courage and endurance. The chill wind biting at his face was nothing compared to the gnawing fear of failure, the weight of his duty pressing down heavier than any chainmail.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate patrols were routine hazards, but the true adventure lay in the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration – a journey far grander than any medieval knight could have ever imagined.
