
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking slightly into the muddied track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city, and the hope it represented, spurred them relentlessly across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal barely detectable even with their advanced sensors. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing the ship's damaged hyperdrive were all part of a typical week.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the scale of her journey and the potential rewards—or catastrophic failures—that lay ahead.
