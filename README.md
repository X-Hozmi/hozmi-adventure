The shimmering heat haze distorted the already indistinct shapes of the distant mountains, promising both peril and untold riches.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold secrets lost to time and guarded by mythical creatures.

The vastness of space, a kaleidoscope of swirling colours and distant suns, both awed and humbled her as she plotted their course, a lone adventurer charting a path through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
