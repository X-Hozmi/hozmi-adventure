
The year is 1348.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged through the unforgiving landscape, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far less daunting than her ultimate goal: reaching the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, a struggle against the elements and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown, but the allure of the legendary city pushed her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncharted wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and smugglers, awaited the jump to the Kepler-186f system, a planet rumored to possess untapped energy sources that could rewrite galactic history.  The dangers were different now – cosmic storms, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of rival corporations. But the thrill of discovery, the siren call of the unknown, remained the same powerful force that drove adventurers across time and space.
