
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of healing spurred him on, every creak of the saddle, every splash through a ford, a step closer to his desperate gamble.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, each jump a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  The vastness of the cosmos was both terrifying and awe-inspiring, the silent hum of the ship a constant companion against the backdrop of cosmic wonders – pulsars, black holes, and the ethereal beauty of dying stars.  The fate of the colonists, and the secrets they held, lay beyond the next jump point.
