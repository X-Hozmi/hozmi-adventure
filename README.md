
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Castilla, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in a tavern tale. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the unsettling silence of deserted villages – but the promise of exotic spices and untold riches kept her weary legs moving forward.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured in light-years, not leagues.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the unsettling possibility of encountering unknown alien life.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors and the thrill of exploring the uncharted cosmos fueled her determination, charting a course across the unimaginable distances of the universe.
