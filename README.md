
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  But the hope of salvation fueled his weary limbs, pushing him ever closer to his uncertain destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking cosmic ballet unfolding before her.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded on the far side of the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies demanded unwavering skill and nerve. Yet, the potential for reunion with lost kin and the promise of a new beginning drove her across the uncharted reaches of space.
