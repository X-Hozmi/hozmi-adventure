Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

From the icy moons of Neptune to the volcanic plains of Kepler-186f, they ventured, seeking answers to the universe's greatest mysteries and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
