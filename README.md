
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a cracked map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching Avignon before winter's icy grip tightened its hold.  Bandits were a constant threat, whispered rumors of plague stalked her every step, and the treacherous mountain passes tested both her strength and her courage.  Yet, with every creak of the mule's harness and the sight of a distant, snow-capped peak, the thrill of adventure burned brighter than any fear.  This journey, to reunite with her long-lost brother, was a gamble with fate itself, but one she was willing to take.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the vibrant nebulae outside the cockpit swirling into a kaleidoscope of impossible colours.  His mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region whispered to contain ancient alien technology.  The risks were immense – uncharted wormholes, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids from the notorious Kryll Syndicate.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of the unknown, fuelled the engines of the starship *Stardust*.  Each jump into hyperspace was a leap into the void, a gamble against the vast indifference of the cosmos, but for Rexx, it was the only life worth living.
