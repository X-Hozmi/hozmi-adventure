
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for delivery to the distant monastery.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of illness are constant companions on her journey, a testament to the perilous beauty and unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, and with it, the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of explored space.  Vast distances and unpredictable wormholes are commonplace, demanding both precision and courage. The alien landscapes of each planet – from vibrant jungle worlds to desolate ice moons – offer a unique and sometimes terrifying beauty.  Each jump to hyperspace holds the promise of discovery, or perhaps, the chilling finality of the void.
