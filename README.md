
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his quest a desperate one.  The whispers of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his village, fueled his journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease itself. The vastness of the land stretched before him, a tapestry woven with peril and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the starving colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction. But the weight of her responsibility, the chance to save a people facing starvation, propelled her onward, a lone star navigating the infinite darkness of space.
