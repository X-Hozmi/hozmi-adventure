
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her meager pack held only essential supplies: dried meat, a waterskin perpetually low, and a well-worn map, its edges frayed from countless consultations.  She was bound for the fabled city of Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of every forest, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the unpredictable weather could turn a day's journey into a death sentence.  Yet, the whisper of ancient secrets hidden within the city's walls propelled her onward, fueling her weary spirit with the promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels lurking in the dark reaches of space.  But the allure of unlocking the universe's greatest mystery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, far outweighed the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble with the infinite.
