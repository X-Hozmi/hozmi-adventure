
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, ever watchful for bandits and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new landscapes – lush valleys teeming with life, desolate wastelands whispering ancient secrets – but also the constant gnawing anxiety of the unknown, the unpredictable nature of the road, and the sheer physical endurance required to traverse this unforgiving world.


Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the nebula of Cygnus X-1.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – the spirit of adventure remains the same.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap into the unknown, a gamble on the integrity of our engines and the accuracy of our navigation.  The reward?  The breathtaking spectacle of alien worlds, shimmering in the cosmic void, each promising new discoveries, strange encounters, and untold riches for those brave enough to reach them.
