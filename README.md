
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of pack animals and weary travelers, creaks across the dusty plains.  The sun beats down mercilessly, the air thick with the scent of parched earth and sweat.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones, a place of untold riches and dangerous magic. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are our constant companions, but the lure of the unknown pushes us onward, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Every creak of the wagon wheel, every rustle in the dry grass, holds the promise of adventure, or death.


Centuries hence, the sleek starship 'Stardust Wanderer' cuts a silent path through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faint starlight, charting a course across unmapped galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, searches for the legendary lost colony of Aethel, rumored to possess technology far beyond their own.  The vastness of space is both breathtaking and terrifying; the threat of pirate attacks, unpredictable wormholes, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel weighs heavily on them.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, fuels their relentless journey across the uncharted expanse.
