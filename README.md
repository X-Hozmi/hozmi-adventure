Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the desert itself threatened with dehydration and scorching heat.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of mythical beasts that haunted the travelers' dreams.  Yet, with every creak of saddle leather and beat of her horse's hooves, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars streaking past their ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, in a kaleidoscope of colours.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Facing unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present danger of pirate raiders, the crew navigated through asteroid fields and wormholes, their journey a dance between breathtaking beauty and terrifying risk. The promise of untold discoveries, however, outweighed the dangers a thousand times over.
