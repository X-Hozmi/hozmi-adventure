
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, said to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes—towering castles, whispering forests, bustling market towns—each a potential haven or a deadly trap.  The journey itself, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was as much the adventure as the elusive destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, a chilling isolation that outweighed any earthly danger.  Yet, the thrill of exploring uncharted territories, the possibility of discovering new life and expanding humanity's reach, fuelled her and her crew on their perilous, intergalactic voyage.
