Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and the parchment map – her only guide to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and potent magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the whispered legends of vengeful mountain spirits chilling her to the bone.  This journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was everything she’d ever dreamt of.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The stars, once distant pinpricks, now blazed close enough to feel their heat on the hull.  Their mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole, a shortcut across unimaginable distances.  The thrill of exploration mingled with the ever-present dread of the unknown – rogue gravitational fields, uncharted nebulae, and the chilling possibility of encountering other sentient life, perhaps not so friendly.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, stretched before them, a canvas painted with the cosmic dust of a million suns.
