
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange. Her journey across the treacherous highlands of Scotland was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed glens, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the biting wind threatened frostbite. Yet, the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, rumored to hold ancient magic, spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each ache in her muscles, fueled her determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos cluster was a constant dance with destruction, requiring precise calculations and nerves of steel.  The breathtaking nebulae, swirling colours unseen on Earth, were a breathtaking distraction from the constant vigilance needed to avoid colliding with rogue planets or encountering hostile alien factions.  The reward, however – a potentially habitable planet on the far side of the galaxy – made the risks worthwhile.
