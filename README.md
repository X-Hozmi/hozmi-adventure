
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her small band, a motley collection of knights, mercenaries, and a surprisingly pragmatic monk, pressed onward, their faces grim beneath the midday sun.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, dwindling supplies – but the hope of salvation fueled their arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its hyperdrive spitting trails of shimmering energy.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a diverse team of seasoned explorers and ambitious rookies, faced perils far beyond medieval bandits.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear their ship apart, alien lifeforms lurked in the unexplored reaches of space, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed large.  The galaxy stretched before them, a vast ocean of opportunity and unimaginable danger.
