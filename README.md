
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a well-thumbed map, and the hope of reaching the rumored lost city of Eldoria before winter’s grip tightened.  Each crest offered a breathtaking vista, but also held the threat of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown – a constant companion on this arduous journey across the breadth of Europe.  She pressed on, driven by whispers of ancient magic and the promise of a new life.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was a treacherous dance amongst swirling nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields, a far cry from the simple compass and stars Elara had relied upon.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos, yet the potential reward – interstellar exploration and the unlocking of galactic secrets – fueled her every decision.
