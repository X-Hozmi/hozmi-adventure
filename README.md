
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Their journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the constant threat of starvation loomed large. Yet, the gleam of Eldoria’s mythical spires, a beacon in the distance, spurred them onward through mud, sweat, and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding population.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading pirate raiders, she and her crew faced cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  The vast emptiness of space offered breathtaking vistas of swirling colors and distant galaxies, but also a stark reminder of their isolation and the immense challenges they faced in their search for a new home amongst the stars.
