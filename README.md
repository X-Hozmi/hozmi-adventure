
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, mirroring the turmoil in his own heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  The journey was a relentless test of endurance; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran dry, and the relentless sun beat down with unforgiving intensity. Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset a prayer for survival.  The road to Zerzura was paved not with gold, but with grit, sweat, and the unwavering hope of a desperate brother.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating; the hum of the hyperdrive a constant reminder of the sheer distance separating her from home.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the ever-present threat of system failures were all part of the routine.  Unlike Sir Reginald, Eva's challenges were technological and cosmic, but the underlying human drive – the relentless pursuit of hope in the face of immense odds – remained the same.
