
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried across kingdoms to a rumored healer.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or the chilling breath of the ever-present wilderness.  Yet, the burning need for survival pushed her onward, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones she traversed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet of Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to interstellar colonization.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts were mere inconveniences compared to the unpredictable alien ecosystems and potential threats that lurked within the unexplored planet.  Eva's courage, and the sleek technology of her starship, were her only allies in a galaxy brimming with both wonder and peril.
