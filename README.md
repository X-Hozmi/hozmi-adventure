
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the parched Breton countryside. Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide to the rumored lost city of Ys.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road ahead. Yet, the lure of forgotten magic and untold riches fuels her onward, each step a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving whims of fate.  The journey is perilous, but the whisper of legend promises a reward beyond measure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals across the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.  Cosmic storms threaten to tear his vessel apart, and pirate factions lurk in the shadows of uncharted systems.  The vast emptiness of space is as isolating as any medieval wilderness, but the high stakes and the allure of exploring the unknown far outweigh the danger.  His destination: a future where the very fabric of interstellar trade hangs in the balance.
