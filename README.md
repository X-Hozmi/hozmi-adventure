
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in a hidden pouch – a payment for a rare herb rumored to grow only in the shadowed valleys of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the fragmented kingdoms of Europe, a perilous gamble for a meager chance at fortune and survival.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him – the adventure, both terrifying and exhilarating, was his lifeblood.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a journey across the Andromeda galaxy fraught with unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of dying stars, Elara and her crew faced the vast, indifferent cosmos, a testament to human ambition and the endless allure of the unknown. The thrill of exploration, the challenge of the uncharted, remained the same, regardless of the era.
