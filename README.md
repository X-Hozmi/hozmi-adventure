
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each rocky pass held the promise of bandits, and each sun-drenched valley whispered tales of forgotten kingdoms and mythical beasts.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and personal notations, was her only guide on this perilous journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, seeking a cure for her ailing brother. The rhythmic clip-clop of hooves against stone was a counterpoint to the constant gnawing anxiety – the thrill of the unknown a dangerous yet intoxicating companion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pull of dying stars was a daily ritual. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the challenges of medieval travel, yet the human desire for discovery – for pushing boundaries and uncovering the secrets of the unknown – remained a timeless constant.
