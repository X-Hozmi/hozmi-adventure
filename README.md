
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, yet the lure of the unknown propelled her forward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the elements and the shadowy figures lurking in the deep forests.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been harrowing, the warp drive straining under the immense gravitational forces.  But the promise of terraforming a new world, of establishing humanity's first extra-galactic colony, fueled his unwavering resolve.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers, from rogue asteroids to unknown alien entities, but the potential for discovery far outweighed the risks.
