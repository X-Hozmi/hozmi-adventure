
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, led his small band across the windswept plains. Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, the harsh sun beating down on their backs, the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching their goal, while each nightfall brought the gnawing fear that Zerzura might be nothing more than a whispered myth.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare mineral vital to galactic stability.  Warp jumps punctuated the endless expanse of space, each one a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Asteroids the size of moons whizzed past, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed large.  Yet, Eva's determination, bolstered by her loyal crew, propelled them onward, a tiny vessel against the breathtaking vastness of the cosmos, driven by the need to protect a fragile peace across the stars.
