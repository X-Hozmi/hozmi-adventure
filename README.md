
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of the Black Death stalked her every step.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes,  hostile villages distrustful of strangers, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her resolve. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown propelled her forward, a fierce determination burning brighter than the distant campfire's glow.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the cosmos a canvas of vibrant colours beyond human comprehension.  His mission: to deliver vital terraforming algae to the newly colonised planet Kepler-186f.  The journey wasn't just about traversing light years; it was navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading opportunistic space pirates, and dealing with the ever-present threat of warp core malfunctions.  The vastness of space instilled a sense of profound solitude, yet the camaraderie of his crew and the significance of his mission fueled his drive across the uncharted galaxy.
