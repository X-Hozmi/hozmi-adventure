
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rough terrain tested both horse and rider.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager sustenance in dusty villages. Their adventure was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the constant, gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps across galaxies were routine, but the unpredictable gravitational currents of the nebula presented a constant threat.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers became a daily ritual.  While lacking the immediate physical danger of Sir Kaelan's journey, Eva faced a different kind of adversity; the loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present fear of encountering something beyond human understanding.
