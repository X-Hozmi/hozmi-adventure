
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless rain.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought the ever-present threat of bandits or wild beasts closer, yet the hope of salvation spurred him on through the treacherous landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered across her holographic display, plotting a course through the treacherous gravitational currents.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of other galaxies, held its own dangers, from rogue asteroids to unforeseen wormhole anomalies, but the promise of interstellar exploration fueled her intrepid journey.
