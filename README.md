
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the whisper of legend, the lure of the unknown, pushed him ever forward, each sunrise a renewed gamble against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's sprawling colony. Warp jumps were risky, pirate raids a constant threat, and the vastness of space itself a daunting, beautiful adversary.  Yet, the promise of new worlds, new life, fueled her determination, each successful jump a small victory against the infinite expanse and the unknown perils that lay beyond.
