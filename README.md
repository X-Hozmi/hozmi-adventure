
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's hopes, a desperate journey to the rumored healing springs of Aquitaine.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of illness were constant companions, but the whispered promises of miraculous waters fueled her onward, each sunrise a new chapter in her perilous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring rescue operation across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between the familiar and the unknown, each jump a gamble against unforeseen cosmic events.  Alien landscapes, sentient space flora, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were nothing compared to the thrill of charting unmapped territories and the profound solitude of the vast cosmos.
