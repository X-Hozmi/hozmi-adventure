
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked its way across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowy canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen by spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every sunset painting the sky in fiery hues, a sense of exhilaration grew. We were pushing the boundaries of the known world, seeking fortune, faith, or simply escape, our journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a generation ship forged from titanium and dreams, hurtled through the inky black towards Kepler-186f.  Generations would be born and die under the cold light of the fusion reactor, their lives dictated by the relentless hum of the engines and the ever-present hope of reaching a new Eden.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, offered a unique adventure; not of bandits and rivers, but of nebulae, black holes, and the potential discovery of life beyond our solar system.  Each warp jump was a gamble, each alien system a potential treasure or a deadly trap.
