
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her leather armor.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over; rumors of a hidden monastery holding ancient texts fueled her quest, but brigands, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any legendary relic. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, peril, and the ever-present uncertainty of the medieval road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured in light-years rather than leagues.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of warp-core instability, her crew represented the intrepid spirit of interstellar exploration. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of adventure, a cosmic gamble against the infinite.
