
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crests the next hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit lords, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are just some of the obstacles in his path.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his destination, fueled by a mixture of faith and the burning desire for glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the Xylossian Confederacy, a journey spanning light-years and numerous uncharted systems.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, avoiding pirate raids from the notorious Crimson Syndicate, and facing the constant threat of warp core instability are commonplace.  The vastness of space amplifies the sense of isolation, yet the promise of untold riches and the advancement of interstellar peace drive her relentlessly forward.
