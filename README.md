
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rocky scramble, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the relentless march of disease.  The rumored haven across the mountains felt less like a destination and more a fading whisper on the wind, yet the unwavering glint in Elara's eyes spoke volumes of her unshakeable resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was treacherous, fraught with unpredictable space storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But Ryla, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, faced the vast emptiness with a steely gaze and the unwavering spirit of a pioneer, driven by a duty to the fragile ecosystems she helped sustain across the stars.
