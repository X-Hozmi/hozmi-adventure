
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's horse stumbled through the sun-baked fields of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel, containing nothing but a chipped map and a few dried apricots, felt heavier than any burden she’d ever carried.  The whispers of war and plague trailed behind her, but ahead lay the fabled city of Samarkand, a promise of spice and silks, of untold riches and perhaps, escape.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, held the thrill of the unknown, the terrifying beauty of a journey across a vast and unpredictable land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the nebula of Xylos.  The swirling colours of the cosmos painted a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous mission:  to retrieve the legendary Aetherium crystals from the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel held its own brand of danger, the risk of dimensional tears and rogue asteroids a constant companion.  But the allure of the unknown, the quest for knowledge and the promise of unimaginable power, propelled them onward through the unforgiving expanse of space, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the heart of an incredible adventure.
