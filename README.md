
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the desert itself, a relentless, unforgiving adversary. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the siren call of adventure, spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of discovery, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course charted by the faint gravitational whispers of a newly discovered planet.  This wasn't just a voyage across a star system; this was a journey into the unmapped expanse of the Andromeda galaxy, a gamble to find a new home for humanity.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the breathtaking beauty of nebulas and distant suns were the constants in his life, a far cry from the predictable routine of Earth, but a risk he gladly took for the sake of exploration and survival.
