
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the relentless sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder;  dodging mud-caked bandits in the Black Forest, bartering for meager rations in squalid villages, and marveling at the snow-capped Alps that pierced the bruised sky.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from treacherous mountain passes to the ever-present threat of disease, but also the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, the promise of reaching a distant shore and fulfilling her pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow reflecting in the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of space remained a terrifying, beautiful mystery.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable cosmic currents.  He faced the threats of rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present danger of equipment malfunction, but the allure of discovery, of mapping the universe, fueled his relentless journey among the stars.
