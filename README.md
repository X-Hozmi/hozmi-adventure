
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Kaelan's throat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a bloody crimson.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, punctuated by fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty and unexpected kindness from strangers encountered along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  The journey demanded not just courage but meticulous calculations, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Sir Kaelan's medieval trek, Eva faced a different kind of peril – the loneliness of interstellar travel, the ever-present threat of equipment failure, and the unknown mysteries awaiting her at the edge of the galaxy.
