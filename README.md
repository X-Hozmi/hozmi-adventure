
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our clothes as we traded the familiar for the unknown.  Ahead lay a treacherous path across the Alps, rumored to be haunted by brigands and shadowed by the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and soldiers, slowly wound its way through mountain passes, the rhythmic clip-clop of horses’ hooves a counterpoint to the chilling wind whistling through the jagged peaks.  Each sunrise brought new challenges –  fording icy streams, navigating treacherous trails, and the constant vigilance required against potential threats.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the Xylos Star Cruiser.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Unlike the medieval caravans of old, our vessel sliced through the inky blackness of space, stars streaking past like cosmic fireworks.  The journey was a controlled, technological marvel compared to the unpredictable trials of the past, but the sense of adventure remained –  the vastness of space, the thrill of exploring the unknown, and the shared risk inherent in venturing to the edge of known reality, all resonated with a similar powerful human spirit of exploration.
