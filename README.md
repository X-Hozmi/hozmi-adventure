
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – the whispered tales of bandit raids, the shimmering mirage of distant oases, the looming shadow of the Taurus Mountains. Our journey, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, is fraught with peril, but the camaraderie forged in shared hardship and the breathtaking beauty of the landscape make every hardship worthwhile.  The scent of woodsmoke from evening campfires and the star-dusted nights are more precious than any jewel.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faintest of nebulae, her crew a diverse team of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and engineers, all bound by the shared pursuit of the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The breathtaking spectacle of swirling cosmic dust and uncharted planets, though breathtakingly beautiful, holds the constant threat of asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present enigma of alien encounters.  The vastness of space is a daunting, awe-inspiring challenge.
