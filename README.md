The scent of woodsmoke and fear hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to the biting wind. Her quest: to reach the rumored city of  Serenia, a haven said to hold the cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of her journey's success, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, dark landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre, uncharted planets was all part of a day's work for a seasoned interstellar explorer. Yet, the silence of space, the immense scale of the cosmos, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown dangers – both alien and mechanical – made each jump into hyperspace a gamble, a breathtaking plunge into the infinite.
