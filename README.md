
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored City of Gold was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience, a flickering candle against the vast, unknown darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the dangers were no less real.  Pirate fleets, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies kept his crew on edge.  The galaxy was their medieval world, a canvas of vibrant wonders and terrifying unknowns, each jump to hyperspace a gamble for survival and a step closer to their distant destination.
