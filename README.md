
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold potent healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, spoke of potential peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the burning need to reach her destination, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace throttles forward, his starship groaning under the strain of jumping across the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The shimmering nebulae outside his viewport, a swirling canvas of cosmic colours, held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the chance to end a millennia-long war fueled his drive, overriding the vast, terrifying distances that lay before him.
