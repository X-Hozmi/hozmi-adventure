
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, fueled his weary legs and spurred him towards the shimmering horizon.  He carried with him not just a map, but a burning hope, a testament to the spirit of the medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expansion.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying – the silent hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion amidst the infinite darkness.  Each jump risked encountering unpredictable cosmic phenomena or hostile alien lifeforms.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed onward, guided by the insatiable human curiosity to explore the final frontier. The universe awaited.
