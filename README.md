
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest, a tapestry of shadowed glades and whispering trees.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the dense undergrowth, treacherous bogs claiming unwary travelers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, propelled him forward, fueled by a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than any sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next breakthrough.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, the vast expanse of space a breathtaking and terrifying backdrop to her mission.  The risks were immense, the rewards potentially infinite, a testament to humanity’s relentless drive to explore the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
