
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of St. Elara, tested their endurance daily.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies were constant companions. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a fierce determination to reach their destination, fueled by faith and the whispered tales of miracles performed at the distant shrine. Every creak of their saddle, every rustle in the long grass, held the promise of both peril and profound discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unexplored planets was routine. The true challenge lay in the unpredictable behavior of the Xylos currents, which threatened to tear her ship apart. Yet, the allure of discovery and the potential to unlock clean energy for Earth spurred her on, making every jump through hyperspace a calculated risk worth taking for the future of humanity.
