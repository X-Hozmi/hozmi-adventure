
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unseen dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He pressed on, driven by hope and a desperate need to return home.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars was a daily challenge.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the occasional crackle of comms from distant outposts. Yet, the knowledge that her cargo could mean the difference between life and death spurred her onward, across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
