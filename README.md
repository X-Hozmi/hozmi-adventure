
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Ys, and the love for her brother, fueled her onward, transforming each hardship into a step closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust*. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, starlight streaked past his viewport, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in.  Alien encounters, malfunctioning systems, and the chilling silence of the void were the daily dangers. But the hope of finding his ancestors, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories, spurred him across the cosmic ocean, making him a pioneer in the endless expanse.
