
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing a perilous route through the Black Forest to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Rumours of untold riches and magical artifacts spurred him on, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the treacherous terrain itself. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational forces and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life.  The glittering tapestry of distant stars offered breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines and the constant hum of the navigation systems, a silent testament to the vast, unforgiving beauty and danger of the cosmos.
