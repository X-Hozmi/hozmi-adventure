
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-scorched plains, treacherous mountain passes, and wary encounters with brigands and feudal lords.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of starvation or ambush, but the lure of Zerzura, fueled by ancient maps and whispered legends, kept him pushing forward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a perilous journey through unmapped star systems and potentially hostile alien territories.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravity wells of rogue planets. The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, pressed in on her, but the promise of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach across the cosmos, burned brighter than any star.
