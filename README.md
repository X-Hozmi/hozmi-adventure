
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold potent healing herbs.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of distant spires spurred her onward, a beacon in a landscape both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of the Kepler-186f planet still clinging to her ship's hull.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a neutron star.  The vastness of space held its own perils – unpredictable solar flares, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms. But the promise of unlocking a galaxy-spanning energy source fueled her determination, making the risks, however terrifying, worthwhile.
