
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Ys, a beacon of hope in a world consumed by despair, drive him onward through the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded beyond known charted space.  Faster-than-light travel is fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the constant hum of the ship's engines a stark reminder of the vast, unforgiving emptiness between worlds.  But the hope of finding survivors, a connection across the cosmic gulf, fuels her journey through the infinite expanse.
