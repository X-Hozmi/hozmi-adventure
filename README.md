
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of bleak, windswept hills.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of untold riches and ancient magic, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving land. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids were commonplace hazards on the interstellar trade routes.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the anxieties of her crew, but Eva's gaze remained fixed on the distant star, a beacon of hope in the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  The promise of new life, new discoveries, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories spurred them onward, making the risks of galactic travel worthwhile.
