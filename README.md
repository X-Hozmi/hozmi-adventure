
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling marriage.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown hedgerows, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, the vast, untamed landscape a constant challenge and a breathtaking reward.  The distant silhouette of the Pyrenees mountains, a beacon of hope and freedom, kept her feet moving, even as exhaustion gnawed at her spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Reyes piloted the *Starseeker*, a sleek starship slicing through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic wonders, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering uncharted anomalies, hostile alien species, or the silent, crushing weight of the void.  But Nova, fuelled by a thirst for discovery and a fierce determination to secure humanity's future, steered her ship forward, towards the unknown depths of the cosmos.
