
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions – a worn map, a few dried figs, and the hope of finding her long-lost brother in the bustling city of Avignon.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of this medieval world; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each day was a gamble, a desperate roll of the dice against fate.

Conversely, Captain Rexx "Comet" Stellaris piloted his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and celestial gases.  His mission: to deliver vital resources across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of warp speed travel.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies – the thrill of exploration and the unknown burned brightly within him. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a dance with the unpredictable vastness of the cosmos.
