
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandit ambushes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of ancient magic, spurred them relentlessly towards their perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly across the vast emptiness of space.  The journey was fraught with its own perils – unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the ever-present risk of system failure in the uncharted reaches of space. But the hope of finding survivors, of forging a new connection across the cosmic ocean, fueled her unwavering determination.
