
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience in the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially dangerous lifeforms.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable gravity wells of distant stars were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew. The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, offered a different kind of peril than Sir Kaelan’s journey, yet the spirit of adventure, the thirst for discovery, remained a constant.
