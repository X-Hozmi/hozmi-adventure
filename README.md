
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of ancient kings.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and glory, spurred them onwards through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission, far more technologically advanced but no less perilous, was to locate a habitable planet for humanity’s expanding colony.  Warp jumps brought them to alien nebulae, each a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic dust and vibrant gases, but also a potential source of danger.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns tested the *Stardust*'s capabilities and the crew's nerve. The survival of countless colonists rested on their shoulders, making their journey as crucial as any medieval pilgrimage.
