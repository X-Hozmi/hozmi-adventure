
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury and then beyond to the Holy Land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – negotiating with surly innkeepers, bartering for supplies in bustling market towns, and navigating by the stars across vast, uncharted territories.  The very air hummed with the potential for both glorious adventure and sudden, brutal death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional burst of static from distant civilizations.  Eva’s mission: to locate a legendary lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was a complex dance of astrogation charts and hyperspace jumps, each one a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.  The thrill of discovery was matched only by the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien lifeforms or suffering a catastrophic engine failure light-years from any known support.
