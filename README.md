
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey across the breadth of England was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to slow their progress even further.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager sustenance in sparsely populated villages.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the King, demanded unwavering resolve, a test of endurance that would forge a bond between knight and squire stronger than any steel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The journey was a symphony of starlight and calculated risk; navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged hyper-drives, and battling the ever-present threat of space pirates.   Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of discovery, but also the potential for catastrophic failure.  Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, knew the universe offered breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger in equal measure.
