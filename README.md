
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, jostled against her back, a constant reminder of the long, perilous journey ahead.  Rumors of a mythical healing spring, hidden deep within the unforgiving landscape, fueled her relentless trek. Bandits, treacherous passes, and gnawing hunger were mere inconveniences compared to the hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother. Each sunrise brought renewed determination, each sunset a testament to her unwavering courage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a billion suns.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, both thrilled and intimidated her.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting a course to previously unreachable worlds, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer venturing where no human had gone before.
