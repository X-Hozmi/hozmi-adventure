
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, the chill autumn wind whipping my cloak around me as I rode towards the rumored city of Eldoria.  Whispers spoke of a lost civilization, of unimaginable treasures guarded by mythical beasts, and the journey itself was fraught with peril.  Bandit lords controlled the mountain passes,  villages were riddled with plague, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed with every sunset.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of Eldoria's secrets, spurred me onward, my trusty sword my only companion against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

A thousand years hence, the Althea skipped through the nebula, its ion drives humming a low, steady song.  My destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun, rumored to harbor the last remnants of the Precursors' technology.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony demanded skill and nerve;  a single miscalculation could mean annihilation.  But the potential for unlocking the secrets of a long-dead race, for understanding the universe on a grander scale, overshadowed any fear.  The cosmos itself was my canvas, a boundless expanse of adventure waiting to be explored.
