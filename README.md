
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new landscape to navigate.  Yet, the whispers of Jerusalem, the promise of healing at its sacred sites, fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain expanse of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the potential for encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms were all part of the risk. But the lure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the cosmos, outweighed any fear.  The stars, a million glittering possibilities, beckoned her ever forward.
