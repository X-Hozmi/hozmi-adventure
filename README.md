
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the fierce determination in Elara's eyes burned brighter than any fear.  The journey was arduous, a tapestry woven with the beauty of untouched landscapes and the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  While pirates and brigands were replaced by rogue AI and hostile alien lifeforms, the thrill of exploration, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, remained the same driving force, pushing her onward to the edge of known space and beyond.
