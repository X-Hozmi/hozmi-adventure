
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at a bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier to my journey east.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the whispers of Cathay, a land of unimaginable riches and silk-smooth rivers, fueled my weary steps. This pilgrimage, though fraught with peril, was a testament to the human spirit's unwavering thirst for discovery.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae painted cosmic masterpieces outside the viewport, a far cry from the muddy tracks of my ancestors.  My mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and potential allies for the newly formed Galactic Federation.  The dangers here were different – rogue black holes, hostile alien civilizations, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space – but the unwavering human drive to explore, to understand, remained the same, echoing across millennia.
