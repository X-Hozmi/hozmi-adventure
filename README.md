
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts where mirages danced like cruel promises, and into the shadow of dense, wolf-infested forests.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril, each sunset the gnawing anxiety of the unknown, but the lure of Zerzura, whispered on the wind by wandering traders and grizzled pilgrims, kept him moving.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across a dozen planets in a distant galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate squadrons, and repairing critical systems under the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation were all part of the day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered breathtaking vistas of celestial wonders, but the loneliness of deep space and the ever-present danger kept Elara and her crew acutely aware of their vulnerability amidst the cosmos.
