
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in the form of a stolen map, promising a legendary lost city rumored to hold untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just a few of the perils awaiting her on this perilous journey across the medieval landscape.  Each sunrise brought the promise of both breathtaking vistas and unforeseen danger.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console.  The jump to Kepler-186f was rough, the warp drive spitting them out light-years from their destination, adrift in a nebula of swirling crimson gas.  His crew, a motley collection of humans and xenos, braced for the repair work ahead; a pirate attack had left their ship riddled with holes and their navigation system fried.  Yet, the lure of Kepler’s rumored crystalline oceans, and the promise of first contact with a sentient species, spurred them onward through the treacherous expanse of the galaxy. The journey, though fraught with technological peril, held a far greater allure than any medieval quest for gold.
