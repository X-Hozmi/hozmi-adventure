
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's retinue as they traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their quest, to recover the lost relic of Saint Aethelberht, led them through treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, across scorching plains where thirst threatened to consume them, and finally, to a hidden monastery rumored to hold the sacred artifact – or perhaps something far more dangerous.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating tangled forests, fording raging rivers, and always, the ever-present threat of violence from both man and nature.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant.  The journey was fraught with peril, not from bandits or bandits or wild beasts, but from unpredictable asteroid fields, solar flares capable of frying their ship's systems, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the black.  The universe held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that dwarfed even the most formidable medieval threats.
