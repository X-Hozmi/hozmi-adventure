
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely more than a goat path, wound through a sun-drenched valley, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the air.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests haunted by brigands, and across unforgiving plains where the sun beat down relentlessly.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the Alcubierre drive.  Navigation through the uncharted expanse of the Andromeda galaxy demanded precise calculations and nerves of steel.  Asteroid fields presented deadly challenges, and the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes threatened to tear her vessel apart.  Yet, the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a new home for humanity, fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any star.
