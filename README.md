
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping my cloak around me as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each step was a gamble, the path barely visible beneath a fresh dusting of snow.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, but the journey was fraught with peril – ravenous wolves, treacherous bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Survival was a daily victory, each sunrise a fresh challenge in this unforgiving land.


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as my starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport were breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of colors unimaginable on Earth.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen uncharted planets.  The challenge wasn't just the sheer distance, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, and the potential threats lurking on alien worlds, both sentient and otherwise. The cosmos held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that could extinguish a life in an instant.
