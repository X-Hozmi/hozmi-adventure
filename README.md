
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried figs and a chipped map, a lifeline in this vast, unpredictable landscape.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, heightened the sense of adventure – and danger.  Bandits, storms, and the sheer, brutal distance were constant companions on her journey to the legendary city of Granada, a quest fueled by rumors of forgotten magic and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-like planet light years from her home system.   The thrill of interstellar travel, the breathtaking cosmic vistas, and the daunting possibility of discovering new life far outweighed the ever-present risk of system failures or encountering unforeseen celestial phenomena. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by humanity's endless curiosity and the thirst for exploration beyond the known boundaries of space.
