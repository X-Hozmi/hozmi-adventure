
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary steed across the parched plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine test his courage and resolve. Every sunrise brings new challenges, from navigating by the stars to bartering for scarce supplies in remote villages, each step a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of unseen dangers lurking in the shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull shimmering under the light of a binary sunset. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and the remnants of a long-lost civilization.  Vast nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields stand between her and her goal, while the constant hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena make every jump a leap of faith into the unexplored expanse of the cosmos.
