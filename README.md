
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim possibility of failure. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, a beacon of hope in a world consumed by darkness, spurred him relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of collapse.  Navigation was a treacherous dance through asteroid fields and unstable wormholes, the constant threat of pirate attacks adding to the already perilous journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy.  While the technology was advanced, the dangers were no less real, the vastness of space a terrifying, beautiful canvas of potential disaster and breathtaking wonder.
