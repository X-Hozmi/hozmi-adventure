
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried across treacherous mountain passes and through lawless bandit territories.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a reminder of the harsh reality of medieval travel – a constant battle against the elements and the savagery of man.  But the glint of distant monastery spires spurred her onward, a beacon of hope in the unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of cosmic wonders – swirling gas giants, shimmering constellations, and distant galaxies spiraling into infinity.  This was exploration on a grand scale, a journey that transcended mere geographical boundaries and ventured into the very unknown of the cosmos.  Yet even amidst the awe, the ever-present threat of celestial anomalies and rogue asteroids served as a stark reminder of the inherent perils of interstellar travel.
