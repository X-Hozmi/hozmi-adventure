
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the blighted lands had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the distant spires of Camelot, his destination, spurred him onward.  He carried with him a vital message, a secret that could save the kingdom, and the weight of hope, heavier than any packhorse.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel had its dangers – unpredictable spatial distortions, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien factions.  But the promise of finding her missing family, a beacon of hope in the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos, fueled her journey across the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in lightyears.
