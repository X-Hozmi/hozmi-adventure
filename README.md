
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, more a collection of faded sketches than precise cartography, offered little solace against the biting wind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of potential dangers – bandits, wild animals, or worse, the rumored wraiths that haunted these desolate heights.  Her quest for the lost city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled her onward, despite the ever-present risk.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The jump was rough, the g-forces a familiar pressure against her ribs, but the breathtaking panorama that followed was worth the discomfort.  Nebulae painted the blackness with vibrant hues, each a potential destination, each a new system teeming with unexplored worlds, dangerous anomalies, and untold riches.  Her mission – to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to contain a source of limitless energy – was a gamble, a journey into the uncharted heart of the cosmos.
