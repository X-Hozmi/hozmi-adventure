
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate plains.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in rocky canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, a fierce determination to overcome the challenges of this unforgiving land, fueled by whispered legends and the burning desire to uncover Zerzura's secrets.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the vast tapestry of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets and galaxies, yet each jump felt like a leap of faith.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Prime, scattered across the uncharted regions of the Andromeda galaxy.  The dangers were different – hostile alien lifeforms, treacherous gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of system failure – but the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, remained the same.
