
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked tracks as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the fragile hope of reaching his destination before succumbing to the elements or the greed of others.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey spanned lightyears, each jump a gamble against unpredictable wormhole currents and the ever-present danger of pirate raiders.  While lacking the immediate physical hardships of Thomas's journey, Eva faced the psychological strain of prolonged isolation, the constant hum of the ship's engines a relentless reminder of the vast, unforgiving emptiness between the stars.  The galaxy, too, held its own treacherous paths.
