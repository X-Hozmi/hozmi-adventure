
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic, is fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the harsh desert tests her endurance at every turn.  Each sunrise brings a fresh challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for supplies in dusty villages, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers.  The whispers of Zerzura, a siren song of adventure, fuel her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's galactic reach.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is a daily affair.  Communication with Earth is a tenuous thread, stretching across light-years of space, and the vast, unknowable emptiness of the cosmos both terrifies and exhilarates her crew. The promise of discovery, however, outweighs any risk, driving them further into the uncharted heart of Xylos.
