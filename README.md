
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack animals and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – the whispered legends of bandit-infested passes, the shimmering mirage of an oasis promising respite, the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  We trade silks for spices, stories for survival, and our lives for the chance to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril but brimming with the intoxicating promise of untold riches and adventure.


Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The *Stardust Wanderer*, a generation ship, navigates the swirling nebula of the Cygnus X-1 system.  We are pioneers, charting unmapped constellations, searching for habitable worlds among the cosmic dust.  The thrill isn't just in the breathtaking vistas of nebulas and distant galaxies, but in the human connection forged amidst the isolation of space – a shared dream of finding a new home, a new beginning, light-years from the dying embers of our old world.
