
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest had been relentless – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous bogs swallowing whole wagons, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawing at the edges of their resolve. Yet, the glint of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, with its promise of untold riches and ancient magic, fueled his determination.  Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath, was a step closer to a legend waiting to be rediscovered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a delicate dance between ancient cartography and cutting-edge technology, the hyperspace jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the void.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists, engineers, and mercenaries, were as diverse as the galaxies they traversed, united only by their shared thirst for exploration and the promise of the fabled Kryll artifact, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across the entire cosmos.  The journey was far from over, but the potential rewards were beyond measure.
