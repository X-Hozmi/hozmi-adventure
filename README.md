
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, promised a hidden monastery beyond the peaks, a sanctuary rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit or beast, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.  The thrill of the unknown, the possibility of discovery, fueled her onward, despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate fleets were commonplace dangers.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time, but the sense of adventure – the breathtaking beauty of cosmic wonders and the ever-present risk of the unknown – mirrored the spirit of medieval explorers, only on a scale unimaginable to them.
