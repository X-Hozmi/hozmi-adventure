
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the legendary city of Samarkand.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a cryptic map, a whispered promise of untold riches, and the gnawing fear of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the plague that stalked the land.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel had its risks; temporal distortions threatened to unravel the fabric of spacetime, and pirate drones lurked in the shadowed sectors.  Jaxx, however, was driven by a thirst for discovery, a yearning to connect with humanity's past, even if it meant facing the unimaginable vastness of space.
