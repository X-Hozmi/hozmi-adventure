
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track as he and his small band traversed the unforgiving wilds separating the Kingdom of Eldoria from the rumored City of Gold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.

The vast expanse of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable riches, or utter annihilation.
