
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little – a few dried figs, a chipped flint, and the tattered map her grandfather had entrusted her with, promising untold riches in a lost city beyond the Whisperwind Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant dance between excitement and the ever-present threat of bandits or starvation.  This journey, fraught with peril, was everything she had ever dreamed of.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby compared to the breathtaking vista of swirling nebulae and distant, uncharted constellations displayed on her viewport.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the vast expanse of space held dangers far beyond the limited understanding of any terrestrial civilization.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the enigmatic whispers from the deep black could end her mission – or her life – in a heartbeat.
