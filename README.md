
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the parched landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide through the treacherous wilds separating her village from the legendary city of Eldoria.  Each creak of her saddlebags, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine – the thrill of the unknown mingling with the constant threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Survival, and the whispered promise of Eldoria’s fabled riches, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  But the whispers of a lost civilization, a technology surpassing even their own, beckoned.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reminder of their perilous journey, a soundtrack to the vast unknown, where alien encounters and unforeseen celestial anomalies were the everyday hazards of interstellar exploration.
