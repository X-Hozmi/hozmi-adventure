
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the unforgiving terrain tested her resilience at every turn.  Yet, the allure of the lost city, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, each hardship a testament to her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take years, traversing treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held both the promise of discovery and the chilling threat of the unknown.  Ava, however, felt the thrill of the chase, the excitement of exploring the uncharted regions of the cosmos.
