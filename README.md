
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their packhorse, Bess, trudged through the mud.  Their quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the far-off Abbey of St. Jude.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their strength and courage, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation shadowed their every step.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory, forging a bond between the knight, his boy, and their loyal beast stronger than any castle wall.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with danger, hardship, and the unwavering pursuit of their sacred duty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders, she relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering determination.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of unimaginable celestial wonders, but also unimaginable perils.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the limits of human ingenuity and the strength of the human spirit in ways medieval travelers could scarcely comprehend.
