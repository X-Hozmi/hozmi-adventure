
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, the salty tang of the Mediterranean a stark contrast to the dust that soon coated our caravan as we ventured inland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where a single misstep meant death, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled us, the promise of reaching the fabled Silk Road a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.  We bartered with wary villagers, shared meager meals around crackling fires, and slept under the vast, indifferent sky, our hearts beating with the rhythm of our own intrepid adventure.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, our starship, cuts a lonely path through the inky blackness between galaxies, its powerful engines a low hum against the silence of space.  We're charting unknown nebulae, mapping uncatalogued planets, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unpredictable.  The dangers are different now – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, rogue black holes – but the thrill of discovery remains the same, a constant hum of excitement beneath the surface tension of calculated risk.  We are explorers, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, etching our names onto the tapestry of the cosmos.
