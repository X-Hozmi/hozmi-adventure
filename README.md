
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of York, a cart laden with meager supplies our only companion against the vast, unpredictable landscape.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless rhythm of horse hooves on cobblestone, then dirt track, then barely a path at all.  We dodged bandits, forded raging rivers, and relied on the kindness – or lack thereof – of strangers in isolated villages. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, the thrill of the unknown a potent counterpoint to the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  The whispered legends of the distant kingdom of Aquitaine fueled our weary steps, the imagined splendor a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was our constant companion, a low thrum that vibrated through our bones as we leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  The star-strewn canvas of the cosmos, breathtaking in its scale, replaced the familiar green fields of Earth.  Each jump brought us closer to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across the known galaxy.  The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, remained the same powerful force driving our journey.
