
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Thomas's saddlebags as his weary horse picked its way across the sun-baked plains.  He clutched the tattered map, its faded ink promising riches in the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the scorching desert threatened to claim him as surely as the whispering sands did the lost caravans before him.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and courage, but the lure of Zerzura, whispered in hushed tones in taverns and marketplaces, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of distant suns was a daily occurrence.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, tested not just her piloting skills but also her resolve.  The unknown dangers lurking within Kepler-186f's atmosphere were a mystery only time, and a brave crew, could unravel.
