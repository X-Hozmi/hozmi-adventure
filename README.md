
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the distant spires of Avignon shimmering in the heat haze.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the Pope for aid against the encroaching plague.  Bandits, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present fear of disease are but a few of the challenges facing Elara on her perilous journey across the fractured lands of medieval Europe, a quest fraught with danger yet fueled by unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in alien flora and rumored to harbor hostile lifeforms.  Warp jumps across light years, navigating asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirate attacks are just a taste of the challenges facing Rexx and his crew as they traverse the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy, their future—and perhaps the fate of humanity—hanging in the balance.
