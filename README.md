
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Ahead, the Pyrenees loom, a daunting barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the Black Death itself, clinging to the air like a shroud. Yet, the promise of finding her lost brother fuels her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  Ahead, the crimson giant of Kepler-186f beckons, its promise of rare Xylium crystals a potent lure.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a dance with the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  Pirate raids, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of void-born anomalies keep her crew on edge, but the thrill of exploration, the sheer audacity of charting unknown galaxies, outweighs the risk.  The universe is vast, and the quest for the unknown her guiding star.
