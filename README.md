
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it carries the weight of her family's hope, a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens her senses, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. This journey is a gamble, a desperate flight from famine and a prayer for a new beginning.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies. The hum of the hyperdrive is a comforting drone against the vast, unknowable expanse.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, a legendary region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms are merely everyday challenges on her perilous quest. The weight of expectation, the hope of galactic advancement, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile civilizations fuel her tireless journey across the cosmos.
