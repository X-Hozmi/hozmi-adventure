
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, the last vestiges of civilization before the vast, untamed forests of Bohemia.  My destination:  the rumored city of Ys, swallowed by the sea centuries ago, but whispered to still hold ancient secrets beneath the waves.  My pack held little – dried meat, a waterskin, a rusty sword, and the tattered map promising fortune (or death) in equal measure. Each creak of the forest, each rustle of unseen things, stoked the fire of my adventure, a test of my courage against the wild unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the void between galaxies.  Andromeda's spiral arms were a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and star clusters, the destination a planet called Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  My crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and scientists, were as diverse as the cosmos itself.  The risks were astronomical – hostile alien life, unpredictable spatial anomalies, the ever-present threat of malfunction – but the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets fueled our journey, our shared quest for the unimaginable.
