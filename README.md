
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the Spine of the World mountains loomed, jagged teeth against a bruised purple sky.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of his saddle, each splash through a freezing stream, was a step closer to either salvation or a grim end among wolves and bandits that haunted these desolate lands. The road was long, dangerous, and full of uncertainty, but the hope of healing fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate drones was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable spacetime distortions near the nebula’s heart.  The thrill of exploration burned brighter than any sun, outweighed only by the responsibility of leading her crew toward a future on a new world.  The galaxy held countless wonders and terrors, but the human spirit, she knew, was capable of conquering them both.
