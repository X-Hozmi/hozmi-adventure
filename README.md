
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for a plague sweeping his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by whispered legends and the desperate pleas of his people, spurred him onward, a lone knight against a vast and hostile world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the vibrant colors of uncharted planets, and the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled her determination, a lone explorer charting a course through the infinite expanse of the galaxy.
