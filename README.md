
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's chainmail as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the very weather itself seemed a malevolent force, threatening to engulf him in blizzards or drown him in flash floods.  Yet, the allure of adventure, the promise of glory and the whispered tales of faraway lands, spurred him on, each sunrise a renewed challenge and each nightfall a precarious respite.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted gravitational anomalies threatened to crush her ship, hostile alien lifeforms lurked in the void, and the vast loneliness of space itself was a constant, gnawing pressure. Yet, the boundless expanse of the cosmos, the promise of discovery, and the hope of a new beginning fueled her journey, making each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
