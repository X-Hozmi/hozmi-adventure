
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary horse onward.  The dusty track wound through a landscape of brooding forests and treacherous mountains, his destination the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling whispers of the unknown that haunted the lonely traveler's path. The weight of his people rested on his shoulders, heavier than any packhorse.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking, yet terrifying, canvas. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by the cosmic ocean.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant reminder of the fragile bubble of safety within the vast, unforgiving expanse.  Every jump through hyperspace held the risk of unforeseen gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, or even… the silent, watchful gaze of something far older and more powerful than humanity.
