
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, mud-caked track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, each sunrise bringing new challenges and the nagging uncertainty of survival. The stars, his only guide in the darkness, offered little comfort against the creeping fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  Unlike Thomas, she possessed advanced technology, but the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns:  unpredictable gravitational forces, the chilling silence of the void, and the constant threat of system failures in the far reaches of the cosmos, far from any rescue.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the echoing emptiness.
