The journey from Canterbury to Rome was a brutal tapestry of sun-scorched plains, treacherous mountain passes, and lawless forests teeming with bandits. Each dawn brought the promise of new hardship: dwindling supplies, the ever-present threat of disease, and the gnawing uncertainty of reaching his destination – a pilgrimage fraught with danger, yet propelled by unwavering faith and the allure of the unknown.

Yet, the vastness of space, the thrill of discovery, and the promise of new civilizations fueled her intrepid spirit. The galaxy was her canvas, and exploration her destiny.
