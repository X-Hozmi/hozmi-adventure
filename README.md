
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, mirroring the turmoil in his own heart.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the den of more than one unscrupulous baron. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the gnawing hunger in his belly, and the ever-present fear of betrayal.  Yet, the glint of the stolen chalice in his mind's eye fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting constant against the breathtaking panorama of alien starscapes.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the derelict research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and deciphering the cryptic warnings left by the station's previous crew were but minor inconveniences compared to the vast, uncharted expanse of space stretching before her.  The fate of countless colonies rested on her shoulders, a weight far heavier than any earthly burden.
