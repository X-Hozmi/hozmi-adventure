
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts.  Each sunset brings the threat of bandit raids, while the relentless sun beats down, testing our endurance.  Whispers of a mythical city, lost to time and legend, fuel our journey, a beacon in this vast and unforgiving landscape. We navigate by the stars and the unreliable guidance of ancient maps, hoping to reach our destination before winter's icy grip claims us.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a generation ship carrying humanity's hope, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven amidst the cosmic sea.  The journey is measured not in days or months, but in generations, a slow, deliberate unfolding of life and death within the metal belly of our ark.  We navigate asteroid fields and nebulae, our course charted by advanced sensors and the unwavering ambition of our ancestors. The future, and the survival of our species, hangs precariously in the balance, each hyperspace jump a gamble against the infinite expanse.
