
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara's small caravan trudged onward, the creak of wagon wheels a constant companion to the nervous bleating of sheep.  Their journey from York to Constantinople was a gamble – a desperate search for a legendary healer rumored to reside in the Byzantine capital.  Every sunrise brought the potential for bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease, but the hope of salvation fueled their arduous passage across the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe and the volatile lands beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, HALIX, calmly charting their course across the galaxy. Their mission: to recover a vital bio-engineered sample from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  The vast distances and unpredictable celestial phenomena were a constant challenge, but the thrill of interstellar exploration and the promise of scientific advancement outweighed the inherent risks of navigating the treacherous cosmic seas.
