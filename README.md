
The year is 1348.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Yet, with every mile, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, a shimmering jewel whispered of in hushed tones, fuels our onward march.  The rough-hewn path is our map, the stars our only true guide across the untamed wilderness.  We face the dangers head-on, forging a bond of survival against the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaps across the void, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of interstellar space.  Each jump is a gamble, a dance with gravity wells and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  We seek the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across known galaxies.  While we lack the visceral dangers of brigands and plague, the unknown, the sheer scale of the cosmos, presents a different, perhaps even greater, terror and exhilaration in our journey.
