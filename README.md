The midday sun beat down on the parched landscape, the only sounds the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves and the occasional cry of a hawk circling overhead.  Her journey across the rugged terrain of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowy forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to stall her progress. Yet, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Avignon, whispered to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh testament to her courage and determination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace for a seasoned explorer like Ryla, but the sheer vastness of space always held a thrilling, humbling awe. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos, but the lure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering something extraordinary, fueled her insatiable thirst for adventure amongst the stars.
