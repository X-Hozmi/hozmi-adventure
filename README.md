
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhineland.  Her worn leather satchel, bulging with maps and a meager supply of dried meats, swung with each jarring step.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold ancient knowledge, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, murky forests echoing with unseen predators, and the constant anxiety of encountering unfriendly lords and their retinues. The adventure was perilous, but the lure of discovery fueled her relentless journey.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the colossal cosmic canvas.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints, but the reward – a potentially habitable planet on the far side of the galaxy – was worth the risk.  Their mission: to chart the planet's resources and assess its suitability for colonization.  While the dangers were different – volatile nebulae, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same potent driving force, echoing across the vast gulf of time separating Elara and Rexa.
