
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she rides, the rhythmic clop of her horse's hooves a counterpoint to the creak of her own weary bones.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at a bruised twilight sky, a daunting but necessary passage on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the whispered promise of untold riches and forgotten magic fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley pilots the *Stardust Drifter*, a battered freighter clinging precariously to the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to deliver a volatile shipment of Xylos crystals across a thousand light-years of unpredictable nebulae and pirate-infested asteroid fields.  The thrill of the unknown, the lure of unimaginable profit, and a healthy dose of recklessness drive him, pushing him further into the vast, unforgiving expanse where the laws of physics are as fluid as the shifting alliances between alien empires and shadowy corporate entities.
