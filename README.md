
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of their saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the very elements themselves. Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering hope of a life-saving miracle.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a survey of potentially habitable planets in the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of wormholes, asteroid fields, and unknown alien species.  The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the backdrop of the infinite cosmos.
