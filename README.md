
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death followed her like a malevolent specter.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the vulnerability of a lone traveler in a world both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.  Yet, the allure of Jerusalem, the promise of pilgrimage and perhaps even fortune, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  The vast, silent expanse of space held both wonder and dread; the potential discovery of new worlds battling the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life or encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, driven by humanity's insatiable curiosity and the boundless possibilities of the cosmos.
