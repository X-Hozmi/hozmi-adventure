
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as his weary steed plodded across the sun-baked plains.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, had sent him on this perilous journey. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the whispers of a monstrous beast haunting the Whispering Mountains fueled the growing unease in his heart.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset a desperate hope for survival.  His quest was fraught with danger, but the lives of thousands depended on his successful passage.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a newly-colonized planet on the brink of ecological collapse.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was routine, but the ever-present threat of pirate raiders and the loneliness of interstellar travel were constant companions.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before them, a testament to humanity's ambition and its vulnerability amidst the cosmos.
