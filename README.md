
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling my nostrils.  Ahead, the looming peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promise both peril and untold riches.  My meager band of companions, a grizzled veteran, a nervous cleric, and a surprisingly nimble thief, are my only allies against bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a fresh test of our courage, our resourcefulness, and the bonds that hold us together as we push ever eastward, towards the mythical city of Zerzura.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion, a low thrum that vibrates through my bones as we jump across the gulf between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport are breathtakingly beautiful, a kaleidoscope of colours unimaginable on Earth.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and lost civilizations. The risks are immense – uncharted space holds dangers far beyond the comprehension of our ancestors – but the potential rewards, a new home for humanity, are worth the gamble.
