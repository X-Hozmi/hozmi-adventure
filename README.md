
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with sun-scorched days and rain-soaked nights. He shared meager rations with fellow pilgrims, their stories of bandits, treacherous passes, and miraculous escapes weaving a potent brew of fear and excitement. Each sunrise offered a fresh challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his destination, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vastness of space dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys; galaxies spiraled into infinity, a cosmic canvas painted with stars and the ethereal glow of distant nebulas.  Her mission: to chart unexplored systems, a perilous quest filled with the potential for discovery and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, solar flares, and uncharted alien territories. The thrill was not in the simple act of travel, but in the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the known.
