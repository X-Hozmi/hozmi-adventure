
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in the dust of a thousand miles, crested the hill.  Below lay the promised city of Avignon, shimmering under the afternoon sun.  Weeks of relentless journey across treacherous mountain passes and sun-baked plains had tested our mettle, the constant threat of bandits and starvation a shadow ever-present.  Each aching muscle, each blister, each shared loaf of bread, forged a bond stronger than any king's decree.  This wasn't just a journey; it was a forging of legend in the crucible of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of warping through spacetime, hummed quietly as it approached the Xylos system.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebulae outside the viewport, felt the familiar thrill of the unknown.  Years spent navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling space pirates had hardened her, but the boundless expanse of the cosmos still held a potent allure.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos crystals, a quest that could rewrite the history of galactic trade – or end in oblivion.
