
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World, a jagged mountain range rumored to house mythical beasts and forgotten magic.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her brother, lost on a pilgrimage to the Holy City months ago. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and adventure.  The vastness of the unknown, the whispers of ancient legends, and the ever-present threat of bandits fueled her onward, one perilous step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the stars a breathtaking kaleidoscope outside the cockpit of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning, spacefaring human civilization.  The risks were colossal – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of ship malfunction. But the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach across the cosmos, outweighed any fear. The vastness of space offered not just peril, but a promise of unimaginable wonders.
