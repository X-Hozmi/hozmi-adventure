
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armour rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in the distant horizon, fueled by tales of miraculous healing, spurred him on through the endless expanse of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were daily challenges.  But the thrill of discovery, the possibility of finding a new home among the stars, outweighed the risks, pushing her ever deeper into the vast unknown.
