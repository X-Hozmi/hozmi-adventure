
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Their journey from the bustling port city of Marseilles to the fabled Silk Road was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and whispered tales of monstrous beasts in the uncharted forests sent shivers down her spine.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering with wary villagers for meager sustenance.  Yet, the allure of the East, the promise of exotic spices and unimaginable riches, propelled her forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of the void.  Navigating hyperspace lanes between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies was a constant gamble against gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced the unknown with a mixture of awe and apprehension.  Each jump to a new star system held the possibility of discovering new life, uncharted planets teeming with alien flora and fauna, or even ancient ruins left behind by long-dead civilizations.  The vast expanse of space, however, held its own dangers, from hostile alien races to the ever-present threat of mechanical failure lightyears from any known help.
