
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke clinging to the air.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost knowledge of alchemists.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of discovery spurred her onward, the whispered tales of Zerzura a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with iridescent gas clouds.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a desperate search for a new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the complex warp gates tested her skills and the ship's endurance to the limits.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, the promise of a new beginning a powerful counterpoint to the loneliness and danger of interstellar travel.
