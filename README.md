
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues. Her journey across the Duchy of Aquitaine was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague hung heavy in the air. Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, a place of untold riches and magic, spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each weary mile, fueled her resolve, transforming the simple act of travel into a desperate, exhilarating quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wanderer*, cut through the inky blackness of interstellar space.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unknown nebulae and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's relentless push into the vast unknown.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
