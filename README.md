
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispering sands themselves seemed to conspire against her, threatening to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges:  navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and facing the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of dying stars was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of her ship.  Every jump to hyperspace held the risk of a fatal navigational error, yet the promise of discovery fueled her onward.
