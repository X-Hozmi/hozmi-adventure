
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and a dwindling supply of dried figs.  The whispers of Moorish raiders, and the ever-present threat of bandits, kept her vigilant. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in desolate villages, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers for safe passage.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Samarkand and uncover the secrets hidden within its ancient libraries, pushed her onward, the thrill of the unknown a potent antidote to the ever-present danger.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with perils far different from Elara's – navigating asteroid fields, dealing with unpredictable wormhole currents, and the constant hum of the ship's failing hyperdrive.  But the promise of discovering new life, charting uncharted territories, and expanding humanity’s reach across the cosmos fueled her determination.  The vastness of space was a lonely, terrifying place, yet it held the ultimate adventure.
