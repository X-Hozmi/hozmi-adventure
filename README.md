
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by traders and pilgrims.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape.  Her meager supplies dwindled, but the promise of Zerzura, a city of gold and untold riches, fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the Xylos nebula, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of cosmic dust and swirling gas giants.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the ailing colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the ever-present threat of space pirates and unpredictable wormholes, but the knowledge that lives depended on her safe arrival surpassed all fear. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held her captive in its awe-inspiring embrace.
