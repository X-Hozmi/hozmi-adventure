
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, promised a hidden monastery holding the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling whispers of the mountain spirits said to guard these heights.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst the cosmic grandeur.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble on untested hyperspace coordinates leading to a legendary lost colony.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, watched with bated breath as the ship shuddered, the swirling colors of hyperspace engulfing them.  The potential rewards – a technological marvel whispered to exist on the lost planet – were tempting enough to risk the dangers of uncharted space.
