His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy aboard the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to possess technology capable of preventing a devastating solar flare predicted to engulf Earth.  The journey was a breathtaking odyssey across light-years of cosmic wonders and perilous asteroid fields, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the universe.  Yet, the fate of humanity rested on her shoulders, making the immeasurable distance a necessary sacrifice.
