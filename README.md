
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her mule laden with meager supplies.  Ahead lies the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  The journey is arduous, a constant test of endurance and resolve, but the lure of the unknown fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky canvas of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the complexities of hyperspace are child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure funding and resources. The risks are immense – equipment malfunctions, cosmic radiation, the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – yet the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds for humanity, drives her and her crew across the vast, uncharted ocean of stars.
