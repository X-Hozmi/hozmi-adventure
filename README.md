
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a chaotic tapestry of creaking wagons and weary beasts,  trudged relentlessly across the sun-baked plains.  Each day brought its own peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings swollen by unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, whispered promises of exotic spices and untold riches, fueled our relentless journey eastward, pushing us beyond the edges of the known world and into the heart of the unknown. The air crackled with anticipation; each sunrise heralded a new challenge, a new adventure in the vast tapestry of medieval travel.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a starship shimmering with captured nebulae light, sliced through the inky blackness, navigating between galaxies. Our mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets amongst the swirling cosmic dust and newly formed star systems.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, while the constant hum of the Althea's engines provided a strangely comforting backdrop to the awe-inspiring vistas of nebulae and distant galaxies, a stark contrast to the earthbound adventures of old.
