
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the next hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little more than dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map – her only guides on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Each day brings fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of finding food and shelter. Yet, with every sunrise, her spirit soars, fueled by the thrill of the unknown and the unwavering faith that guides her steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile environment of the bridge.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey is fraught with peril: unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of solar flares, and the loneliness of interstellar travel. But the promise of discovering new life, of charting unmapped territories in the vast cosmic ocean, fuels her relentless pursuit, mirroring the adventurous spirit of medieval pilgrims but on a scale unimaginably grander.
