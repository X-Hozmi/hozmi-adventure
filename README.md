
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their resolve. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in a race against both time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking against gravitational tides unseen by mortal eyes.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, punctuated by the occasional shimmering anomaly or the silent, deadly threat of asteroid fields.  The fate of millions rested on her ability to navigate the treacherous currents of the cosmos and locate a planet swallowed by the vast, star-dusted sea.
