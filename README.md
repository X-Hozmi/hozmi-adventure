
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a map promising untold riches guarded by a mythical beast, a journey fraught with peril across treacherous passes, bandit-infested forests, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential harbinger of danger, yet the lure of adventure propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of a thousand burning suns.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable hazards of space – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life.  But the allure of discovery, of charting the uncharted and unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos, was a siren song she couldn't resist.
