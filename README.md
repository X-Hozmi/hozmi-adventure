
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through the dense Black Forest, shadows lengthening with the approach of twilight.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the flickering torchlight: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  His quest, to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude and retrieve a sacred relic, felt as perilous as it was vital.  He pressed on, fueled by faith and a desperate hope for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  While dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life – the thrill of exploration remained the same.  The universe was a boundless frontier, and Eva, with her intrepid crew, was ready to chart its mysteries.
