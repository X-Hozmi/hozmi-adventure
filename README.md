
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the King across the treacherous mountain passes, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadows, wild animals roamed unchecked, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, fueling a fierce determination to reach her destination, a determination forged in the crucible of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda Galaxy was measured not in days, but in light-years, demanding flawless calculations and unwavering courage.  Beyond the shimmering veil of stars lay the promise of new worlds, rich in resources and untold mysteries.  But the vastness of space held dangers equally profound – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, all hazards faced with the cold precision and daring characteristic of interstellar travel.
