
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary mounts, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mimicking the swirling anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the potential for bandit raids, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Samarkand's riches, its bustling bazaars and scholarly libraries, fuel our arduous journey, a perilous pilgrimage for knowledge and fortune across a vast and unforgiving land.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of generations, hurtles through the inky blackness towards Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace are daily challenges, demanding the precision of expert pilots and the ingenuity of brilliant engineers.  Our mission, a search for habitable worlds suitable for human colonization, carries the weight of humanity's future on its sleek, interstellar hull.  The vastness of space holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, making every jump to warp a gamble on the fate of our species.
