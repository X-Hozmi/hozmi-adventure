
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses' hooves stirring clouds of red dirt.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, promised riches beyond measure but also the perils of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new test of endurance, a new challenge to their dwindling supplies and their unwavering resolve, the whisper of ancient legends their only compass through the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of warp travel were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, yet Eva pressed on, driven by the promise of a future secured by her courage and skill.
