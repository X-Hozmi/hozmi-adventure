
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a clumsy serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new peril – bandit raids, treacherous river crossings, the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its whispers of exotic spices and untold riches in distant Cathay, spurred us onward.  We faced scorching deserts, icy mountain passes, and the unsettling silence of vast, empty steppes, our journey a constant negotiation between hope and the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula, her gaze fixed on the star chart depicting the Xylos system, our destination.  While dangers remained – pirate fleets lurking in the black, unpredictable wormhole instabilities, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – the scale was galactic. We weren't battling bandits; we were charting unknown space, seeking resources vital to the survival of humanity scattered amongst the stars,  a journey far beyond the scope of our medieval ancestors, yet fueled by the same intrepid spirit.
