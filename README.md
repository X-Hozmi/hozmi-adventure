
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed canyons, treacherous rivers must be forded, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a desperate hope that she will survive to see the morrow and reach her destination.  The unknown stretches before her, a tapestry woven with adventure and fear.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' its sleek hull gleaming under the light of a nebula.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding civilization.  Wormholes beckon, promising shortcuts through the vast expanse of space, but also harboring unpredictable dangers.  Alien civilizations, both benevolent and hostile, await discovery.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime, but the allure of the unknown, of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fuels her journey.
