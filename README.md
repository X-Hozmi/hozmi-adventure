
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to reach the rumored monastery holding the lost scroll of Saint Amand, pushed her onward despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of the harsh landscape.  The sun beat down relentlessly, a stark contrast to the chilling night winds, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where every mile was a gamble.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the cosmos was vastly different, yet equally perilous.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic storms and the unpredictable gravity wells of uncharted planets.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize worth risking the dangers of interstellar space.  The vast, empty expanse offered a different kind of solitude, a lonely battle against the unknown, but the thrill of discovery burned brighter than any earthly ambition.
