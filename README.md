
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bites at Sir Reginald's face as he leads his small band across the treacherous, snow-dusted Alps.  Their quest: to retrieve the lost relic of Saint Aella from a rumored hermitage nestled deep within the mountains.  Each step is a gamble against the elements, the lurking bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The promise of glory and the weight of his sworn oath spurred him onward, the rough-hewn trail a testament to the dangers and rewards of medieval overland travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling Sol Federation.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels felt commonplace compared to the mental strain of interstellar jumps and the existential dread of encountering unknown alien species.   Yet, the thrill of exploration, the vastness of the cosmos, and the hope of securing her people's future propelled her forward on her perilous journey across the galaxies.
