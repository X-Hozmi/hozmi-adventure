
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the biting wind.  Each creak of her saddle was a reminder of the perilous journey ahead – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any promised reward.  Yet, the whispered tales of the lost city of Eldoria, its rumored fountains of youth and untold riches, fuelled her weary spirit, pushing her onward towards the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive engines was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the eerie silence of interstellar space.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the notorious space pirates of the Cygnus Arm was all in a day's work, but the potential discovery of new life – and the thrill of exploring the uncharted cosmos – kept her engines roaring towards the edge of the known galaxy.
