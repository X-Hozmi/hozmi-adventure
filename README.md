
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a half-eaten loaf.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness, was fraught with peril.  Rivers swollen with spring rains, treacherous mountain passes guarded by wolves, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the obstacles between her and her goal.  This journey, though arduous, held the promise of a miracle.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Xylos was rough, the warp drive spitting them out near a nebula teeming with unstable energy signatures.  His crew, a motley collection of humans and Xylarionians, murmured nervously as sensors beeped frantically.  The mission, to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting Xylos, was far from over.  The station was rumored to be infested with Kryll, bio-engineered horrors whose psychic abilities could shatter a starship's hull with a thought.  But the galaxy's fate, quite literally, depended on their success.
