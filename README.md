
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a far cry from the bustling marketplace he'd left behind in London.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each hesitant step of his horse, was a step closer to hope, or perhaps, to an untimely end in the bandit-ridden wilds.  Every sunset brought a new challenge – treacherous rivers, looming forests guarded by unseen eyes, and the constant threat of hunger and disease.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of danger – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any help. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a testament to human ambition and the enduring pursuit of discovery across the galaxy.
