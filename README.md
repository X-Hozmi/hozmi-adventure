
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the dry grasses, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril, but the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, through scorching heat and chilling nights under a canopy of indifferent stars.  Every landmark, every fleeting encounter, etched itself into the tapestry of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his cockpit.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumoured to be teeming with both unimaginable riches and lethal xenofauna.  Warp drives hummed, navigating the treacherous gravitational currents between galaxies, a far cry from the arduous journeys of his medieval ancestors.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held its own brand of terrifying unknowns, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.
