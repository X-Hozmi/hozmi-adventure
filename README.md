
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Venice, the salty tang of the Adriatic still clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward.  Our caravan, a chaotic tapestry of merchants, mercenaries, and pilgrims, wound its way through sun-drenched Italian hills, across the unforgiving Alps, and into the shadowed forests of Bavaria. Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in mountain passes, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the allure of the Silk Road, the promise of exotic spices and untold riches in the East, fueled our weary steps.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship, hummed with the quiet efficiency of its fusion reactors as it warped through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey, spanning decades, was a tapestry woven with the threads of scientific discovery, interpersonal drama, and the profound isolation of interstellar travel.  The vast emptiness of space held both unimaginable terror and breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the familiar limitations of terrestrial travel.
