
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death shadowed her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by a desperate hope for a cure for her ailing brother. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, spurred her onward, a testament to the raw courage needed to survive a medieval journey where the road itself was a treacherous beast.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive a constant lullaby.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the galaxy after a devastating supernova.  The vastness of space, a swirling canvas of starlight and cosmic dust, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the cosmos, where the price of failure was oblivion.
