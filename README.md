
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks a fiery orange.  Each creak of the wooden wheels was a testament to the miles already conquered, a counterpoint to the whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones, felt more a desperate pilgrimage than a grand adventure, yet the hope of finding her lost brother fueled her onward, past crumbling castles and through treacherous mountain passes.  The unknown lay ahead, a tapestry woven with equal parts danger and exhilaration.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its swirling colours a breathtaking distraction from the daunting task at hand.  Their mission: to chart a course through the unmapped Xylos Cluster, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the abyss, but the potential rewards – unlocking new worlds and untold resources – outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the ship's engines, was a constant reminder of their fragile place in the cosmos, and the immense possibilities that lay before them.
