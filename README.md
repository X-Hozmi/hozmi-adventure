
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward.  The midday sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King in Prague, led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and through bustling, disease-ridden towns.  Each sunrise brought new perils –  the threat of highwaymen, the sting of hunger, the ever-present fear of the plague. Yet, with each step, the thrill of the unknown spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Navigation through unpredictable gravitational fields, encounters with hostile alien species, and the constant threat of system failures tested her and her crew to their limits.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, fueled their determination to complete their perilous journey.
