
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat in this lawless land.  Bandits, starvation, and disease lurked around every bend, making her journey a constant test of endurance and cunning.  She pressed onward, guided only by the setting sun and the unwavering fire in her belly.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula, its navigation systems charting a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  The vibrant cosmic dust swirled around them, a breathtaking spectacle that belied the inherent dangers of their mission.  Uncharted space meant unexpected gravitational anomalies and hostile alien lifeforms, each a potential graveyard for their fragile vessel.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, fueled their courage, pushing them ever closer to the edge of the known galaxy.
