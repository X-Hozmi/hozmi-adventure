
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Abbey of Saint-Michel, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the abbey, and the hope it represented, spurred her onward.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across the star system after a catastrophic solar flare.  Navigation was a dance between wormholes and asteroid fields, the ship's AI constantly battling unpredictable gravitational forces.   The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the potential for rediscovering a lost civilization and the thrill of galactic exploration fueled his unwavering resolve.
