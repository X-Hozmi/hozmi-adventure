
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her meager possessions and a growing sense of foreboding.  Rumors of a plague sweeping the land whispered on the wind, a chilling counterpoint to the cheerful chirping of cicadas.  Her journey to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the unforgiving terrain tested her strength and resolve at every turn. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and determination in a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense canvas of space.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been treacherous, pushing the ship's engines to their limits.  Ahead lay a planet teeming with unknown lifeforms and the promise of untold riches, or perhaps, utter annihilation.  The vast distances between star systems were a constant reminder of her isolation, a humbling experience in the face of the cosmos' sheer indifference.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the siren call of the unknown, propelled her onward, towards the next undiscovered world.
