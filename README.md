
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were daily companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim reality of his perilous undertaking, yet the lure of Zerzura burned bright in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, lost in the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable whims of warp-drive technology were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space offered little solace, yet the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of charting the unknown, fueled her relentless journey across the cosmic sea.
