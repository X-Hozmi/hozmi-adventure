
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and damp earth, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest, each gnarled oak a potential hiding place for bandits or worse.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with hostile villagers, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of salvation pushed him forward, his heart a drum against the rhythmic clop of hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, held its own perils: unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of solar flares, and the unnerving silence of interstellar space.  But Eva, her eyes fixed on the distant emerald glow of her target, felt a kinship with Sir Reginald, a shared yearning for discovery and the unwavering courage to face the unknown, no matter the cost.
