
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the chill air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance at the looming peaks, each whispered prayer to the Virgin Mary, fueled her relentless journey.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were only surpassed by her unwavering determination to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the key to salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting her ship in ethereal hues.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the answer to humanity's dwindling resources.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of distant suns, Eva's courage was tested not by bandits, but by the sheer immensity and danger of interstellar travel.  The fate of billions rested on her shoulders, a weight far heavier than any earthly burden.
