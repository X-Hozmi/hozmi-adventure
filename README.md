
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles compared to the unknown that lay ahead. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fragile hope for survival, fueling his relentless journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of a thousand suns. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of energy capable of bridging the chasm between galaxies.  Warp jumps across light years, encounters with sentient space fungi, and skirmishes with opportunistic space pirates were all in a day’s work for Eva and her crew. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested their courage and resolve as they ventured into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
