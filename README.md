
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a chipped flintlock pistol, a well-thumbed map promising riches in a distant kingdom, and a gnawing hunger.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey across the untamed lands, but the lure of adventure, of proving her worth in a world that scoffed at women warriors, spurred her relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the potential discovery of a new habitable world far outweighed the risks.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers united by a thirst for the unknown, monitored the ship's sensors for signs of life, their hearts pounding with anticipation as they ventured into the uncharted territories of space, a journey far removed from Earth but propelled by the same human spirit of intrepid exploration that drove Elara centuries before.
