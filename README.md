
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of healing spurred her on, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport were breathtaking, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered galaxy, a region teeming with uncharted planets and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  The risks were immense – unknown threats lurking in the depths of space, the possibility of navigational errors in the unmapped cosmos – but the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, fueled her relentless exploration.
