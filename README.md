
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's weary band crested the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance like a mirage. Their journey from the Scottish highlands had been brutal; skirmishes with bandits, weeks of torrential rain turning paths to mud-choked rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawing at their resolve. Yet, the promise of a king's ransom and the chance to prove their loyalty fueled their relentless march across the war-torn continent, each step a testament to their courage and resilience.

Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hummed with the power of a thousand suns as it warped through space, leaving behind the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way.  Ahead lay the Andromeda Galaxy, a destination years in the making, a gamble on a new life amidst uncharted systems and the alluring prospect of discovering a lost civilization whispered about in ancient texts.  The vastness of space, however, held its own terrors - rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic entities.
