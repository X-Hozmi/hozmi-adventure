
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales of spice and silks whispered in the taverns of London, tales that fueled his journey east.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, famine, and disease were ever-present shadows, but so too was the allure of the unknown, the chance to see lands beyond the reach of the king's messengers and the furthest reaches of the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the vast, silent beauty of space outside.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration remained unchanged.  The vastness of the cosmos beckoned, promising discoveries that could rewrite the history of humankind and change the fate of worlds yet unknown.
