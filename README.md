
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled a nervous excitement.  She wasn't fleeing, not exactly, but seeking – seeking a rumored monastery tucked away in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the possibility of failure. Her journey was a tapestry woven with peril and possibility, a testament to the unwavering bonds of family in a time of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Zydonian cruisers was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the unknown. Would she find the colonists alive? Would she uncover the secrets behind their disappearance?  The vastness of space offered limitless opportunity, but also held the chilling promise of isolation and the cold, uncaring emptiness of the void.
