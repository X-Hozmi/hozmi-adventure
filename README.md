
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was proving far more arduous than the grizzled cartographer had promised.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers ran dry unexpectedly, and the relentless sun threatened to bake her alive.  Yet, the whispered legends of Zerzura’s untold riches and magical artifacts spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the overwhelming vastness of the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance and courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was a daily occurrence, the vast emptiness of space both exhilarating and terrifying.  The advanced technology of her ship allowed for near-instantaneous jumps between star systems, yet the journey felt as perilous and unpredictable as any medieval trek. The lure of unlocking the universe's secrets, of breaking the boundaries of known space, fueled her unwavering determination to reach her goal.
