
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage undertaken for her ailing brother's salvation, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the constant gnawing hunger was a companion as relentless as the sun.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, a testament to the enduring spirit of medieval travelers who braved immeasurable hardship for faith, fortune, or simply survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the vastness of the cosmos remained a constant source of awe and apprehension.  Her mission: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, teeming with unknown dangers and uncharted territories.  The technological marvels of her vessel couldn’t completely alleviate the loneliness of interstellar travel, nor the existential weight of venturing into the absolute unknown, a new frontier just as challenging and inspiring as the medieval pilgrimage centuries before.
