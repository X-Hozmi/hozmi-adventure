
Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track stretched before him, a ribbon of brown snaking through the unforgiving landscape.  Weeks had bled into months since he’d left the familiar comfort of his castle, his quest a whispered rumour of a mythical city lost amidst the whispering sands.  Each sunrise brought the promise of danger – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous terrain threatening to swallow man and beast whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, spurred him onward, a knight errant chasing a dream across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, her heart pounding in sync with the ship's hyperdrive.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across the galaxy.  The journey had already tested her crew’s mettle – asteroid fields dodged by a hair's breadth, encounters with rogue K'tharr warships, and the constant gnawing loneliness of interstellar space.  But the promise of unlocking the universe’s secrets, of charting a course through the unmapped constellations, fueled her unwavering resolve, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the cosmos.
