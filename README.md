
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  The journey was fraught with peril, a constant dance between hope and despair, the vastness of the unknown a looming presence alongside the ever-present threat of the physical world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey measured not in miles, but light-years.  The hum of the warp drive was a constant companion, the alien landscapes visible through the viewport a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic wonder. While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration, the push towards the unknown, echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved the earth below.
