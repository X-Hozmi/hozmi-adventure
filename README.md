
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden city he’d fled. His quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled high in the Alps, where an ancient text promised a cure.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of fear and anticipation through him; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp jump malfunction.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's cutting-edge technology.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, was a humbling backdrop to her perilous quest, a far cry from the muddy roads and dangerous bandits of Thomas's era, yet equally fraught with the thrill of the unknown.
