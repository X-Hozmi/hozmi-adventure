
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey across the known world, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown. The weight of her hope, however, outweighed the fear.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Lyra Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey for habitable planets.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers; rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of uncharted cosmos and the potential to discover new life fueled her onward, a lone explorer charting a course across the infinite expanse.
