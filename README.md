
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, a cacophony of sights and sounds that faded as we ventured inland.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth replaced the salty tang of the sea as our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travellers, wound its way through the French countryside.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, and the whispered legends of distant lands kept our spirits high, driving us ever onward towards the fabled city of Constantinople.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life vastly different from our own.  The journey, while seemingly instantaneous, was a sensory deprivation chamber of sterile white walls and the constant, low thrum of the ship's engines.  Yet, the breathtaking vista of the swirling nebulae, glimpsed through the viewport during the brief periods of sublight travel, made the sterile confines worthwhile. The anticipation of discovering a new world, encountering alien species, and charting unknown territories – that is the adventure of the stars, a voyage far grander than any medieval pilgrimage could ever hope to be.
