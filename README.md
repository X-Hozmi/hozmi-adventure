
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s worn boots pounded the rutted track.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown – a whispered rumour of a hidden monastery nestled in the Dragon's Tooth mountains, a chance encounter with a wandering scholar carrying forbidden texts, the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests. Her journey, fraught with peril and hardship, was a tapestry woven with breathtaking vistas, the camaraderie of fellow travellers, and the gnawing uncertainty of what lay beyond the next crest.  The promise of discovery fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace;  the true adventure lay in the exploration of new worlds.  Each jump to hyperspace promised a chance encounter with alien civilizations – some welcoming, others decidedly less so.  Her crew, a ragtag band bound by shared risk and a thirst for the unknown,  faced challenges that dwarfed those of any medieval knight. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held a mystery that pulsed with the same vibrant allure as the whispered legends of old.
