The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, a stark contrast to the chilling winds that had whipped across the snow-capped mountains just days before.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elara – had taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring rains, and into the shadow of ancient, forgotten ruins whispering secrets of a bygone age.  Each sunrise brought new perils, but the unwavering glint of his purpose kept him moving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered across her holographic console, displaying the complex gravitational pathways between distant star systems. Her mission – to locate a habitable planet for a desperate colony – was far from over.  Asteroid fields, rogue plasma storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were just a few of the obstacles she faced in her journey across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.  The weight of countless lives rested on her shoulders, fueling her determination to reach her destination.
