
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to overtake me. Yet, the whispers of Zerzura's riches and ancient secrets fuel my weary steps, pushing me onward against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive is a comforting drone against the infinite blackness.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-analogue light years away.  Though the journey is measured in warped spacetime rather than weary miles, the risks remain: rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds – that's the siren song that pulls me across the galaxy, a modern-day explorer charting a course among the stars.
