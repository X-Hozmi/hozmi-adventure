
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought fresh perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the constant gnawing hunger that tested both body and spirit.  But the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades prior.  Navigation was treacherous, navigating asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of celestial wonders, both awed and humbled her.  Yet, the possibility of finding survivors, of uncovering the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance, propelled her onward, across the unimaginable distances of the galaxy.
