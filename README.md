
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's hope, a secret map promising a hidden valley where life was said to flourish, untouched by the plague that ravaged her homeland. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both danger and the thrilling possibility of a new beginning.  She pressed onward, her resolve as strong as the ancient stones she passed.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the celestial dust and unknown dangers that lurked between stars. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before them, a boundless ocean of possibilities and perils, demanding courage, precision, and a dash of reckless abandon from its intrepid explorers.
