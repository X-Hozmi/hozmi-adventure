
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it offered, spurred them relentlessly forward, their journey a testament to human courage and unwavering resolve.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's advanced technology.  The vastness of space was a daunting opponent, but the potential discovery of survivors, and the unraveling of the mystery surrounding Kepler-186f, fueled her unwavering determination to complete her perilous interstellar voyage.
