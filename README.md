
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in trade goods – silks from the East, spices from faraway lands – a fortune that could make him rich, or leave him rotting in a roadside ditch.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  His journey, a tapestry woven with danger and the allure of untold wealth, was a gamble on a scale only the medieval world could offer.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  The journey, spanning light years and fraught with the perils of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, was a testament to human ingenuity and a relentless pursuit of the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace brought her closer to a discovery that could rewrite the history of galactic exploration, or end her life in the cold vacuum of space.
