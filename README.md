
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant war hung heavy in the air. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, lawless territories teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-earned victory in her perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' sliced through the inky blackness of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, grappling with unpredictable wormholes, and evading the ever-present threat of pirate fleets were all part of interstellar travel.  The vast distances and the loneliness of the cosmos tested her crew's courage and resilience, but the promise of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, fueled their daring voyage across the galactic expanse.
