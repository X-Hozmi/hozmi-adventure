
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their mission: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the creeping despair of their failing quest.  The sun beat down relentlessly, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving distance that lay between them and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the resources to fuel humanity's expansion across the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of uncharted systems was a daily challenge.  But the greater peril lay in the unknown – alien life, hostile factions vying for control of the planet, and the constant gnawing fear of becoming lost in the infinite expanse of space, forever adrift among the stars.
