
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armour gleaming under the harsh sun, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, scorching deserts that tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled their weary steps, a shared spirit of adventure binding them closer with every league they traversed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders and the constant hum of the ship's engines, was a far cry from the medieval plains.  Yet, the same spirit of adventure, the same courage in the face of the unknown, burned within her crew as it had in Sir Gareth’s – the only difference being the scale of their endeavor, and the stars themselves their guide.
