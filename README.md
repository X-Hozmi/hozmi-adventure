
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Bordeaux, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Pyrenees, rumored to be haunted by bandits and wild beasts.  Our meager supplies – dried meats, hardtack, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between us and the unknown.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or disaster, as we pressed onward towards the fabled Silk Road.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity nestled in a distant star system.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the glittering tapestry of nebulae and distant galaxies, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The risk of warp storms, asteroid fields, and unknown alien encounters is ever-present, yet the potential reward – a new beginning for our species – fuels our unwavering determination to reach our distant shore.
