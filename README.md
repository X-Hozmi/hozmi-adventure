
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and meager coins; it contained the map – a whispered legend of a lost city shimmering with gold and forgotten magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the thrill of potential danger – bandit raids, starvation, or the unknown horrors lurking beyond the next ridge. Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Theron piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity's scattered colonies.  The journey was a calculated dance between warp jumps and asteroid fields, a constant vigilance against pirate fleets and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The vast, alien landscape of the cosmos held a different kind of peril, a silent, cosmic dread, but the hope of a new beginning, of forging a future among the stars, burned brighter than any earthly treasure.
