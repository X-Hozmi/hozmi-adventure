
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, urged his weary destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of sun-drenched lands and opulent cities far to the east.  Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his horse, was a testament to the arduous journey – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger all serving as constant reminders of the perils faced in pursuit of his quest: the legendary Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues painted a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous journey across the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal faint and fading, a desperate plea for aid against an unknown threat.  Navigating asteroid fields, outmaneuvering space pirates, and repairing vital systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation were all part of a daily routine; the vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held far more dangers than any medieval road ever could.
