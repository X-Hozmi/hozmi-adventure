
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes, a biting wind whipping my cloak around me.  Each step was a gamble, the path a treacherous ribbon of ice and rock clinging precariously to the mountainside.  My meager pack held only essential supplies – dried meat, a waterskin, and the crude map that was my sole guide to the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold secrets older than Christendom itself.  The dangers were myriad – bandits, avalanches, starvation – but the lure of the unknown propelled me onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  We were charting a course through the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia for slower vessels, but for us, a mere matter of weeks.  The swirling nebulae painted the viewport in breathtaking colors as we jumped from one star system to another, searching for the legendary Xylos planet, a world said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were different now –  cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – yet the thrill of exploration, the insatiable curiosity to reach the unknown, remained the same driving force.
