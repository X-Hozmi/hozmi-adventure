
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The rough-hewn track snaked through a sun-baked landscape, the distant peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming like skeletal fingers against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  His quest – to find the lost city of Eldoria and the legendary Sunstone – led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring rains, and into the hushed, unsettling silence of forgotten ruins. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing uncertainty of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, detailing the treacherous asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies that lay between her and her goal.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense risks inherent in interstellar exploration.  Yet, the potential rewards – the discovery of new life, new worlds – spurred her onwards, a modern-day explorer charting the uncharted seas of the cosmos.
