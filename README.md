
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel clutched tight.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, burned in her breast, a counterpoint to the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant companions on her arduous journey – a perilous tapestry woven with breathtaking vistas and fleeting encounters with both kindness and cruelty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable worlds for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The jump to hyperspace was a violent lurch, but the breathtaking panorama of celestial bodies, each a potential haven or a deadly trap, spurred her onwards.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was profound, but the potential for discovery – for finding a new Eden among the infinite stars – fuelled her relentless drive.
