
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a lost monastery, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit or beast, yet the unwavering hope of salvation spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, perilous beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Jackson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his destination a remote planet rumored to possess the fabled Kryll crystals.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent, star-dusted void outside.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily routine, a far cry from the medieval dangers Elara faced, but the risks were no less real.  The lure of the Kryll – a source of unimaginable power – fueled his journey across the galaxy, a journey as perilous and potentially rewarding as any medieval quest.
