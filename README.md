
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-infested forests, and into the bustling, sometimes hostile, towns that dotted the landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the allure of the sacred object, and the glory it promised, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting her ship's viewport in breathtaking hues.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing vital systems under the watchful eye of alien predators were just a few of the hazards she faced.  Unlike Reginald, her challenges were technological and interstellar, yet the thirst for discovery, the allure of the unknown, and the weight of her responsibility bound them both to a shared spirit of adventure.
