
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very terrain itself presented a constant challenge.  Each sunrise brought new uncertainties, each nightfall a precarious search for shelter, yet the unwavering spirit of adventure, fueled by faith and the lure of the unknown, propelled him ever closer to his distant goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with hazards: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets, pushed her and her crew onwards, into the breathtaking and terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
