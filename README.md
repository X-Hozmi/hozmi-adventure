
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, for this journey to Avignon wasn't a pilgrimage, but an escape.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and the whispers of the Black Death followed her like a malevolent ghost.  Yet, the hope of a new life spurred her on, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of fear and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast tapestry of the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, the hyperspace turbulence a jarring reminder of the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a beacon of hope in a galaxy teeming with both wonder and peril.  The unknown stretched before her, a breathtaking expanse of celestial bodies and potential discoveries, but also a potential graveyard for the unwary.
