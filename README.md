The rough track, barely a trail in places, snaked through the whispering woods of Eldoria, promising adventure – and perhaps peril – at every bend.  He carried the King's decree, a mission of both diplomacy and espionage, that would take him across kingdoms, through treacherous mountain passes and across vast, unforgiving plains, facing bandits, rival knights, and the ever-present threat of the wild.

The thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, fueled her onward, despite the ever-present dangers lurking in the black.
