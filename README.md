
The clatter of hooves on cobblestone echoed through the misty morning as Sir Gareth, his shield emblazoned with a lion rampant, rode out of the castle gates. A whisper of the wind carried news of a lost princess held captive by a wicked sorcerer in the heart of the Whispering Woods, a place whispered to be teeming with ancient magic and perilous beasts. Armed with his sword and a trusty map, Gareth embarked on a journey, his path fraught with danger, intrigue, and the promise of legendary treasures.

With her crew of seasoned explorers, Elara set course for Aethel, embracing the unknown and the thrill of discovering a lost civilization amongst the infinite expanse.
