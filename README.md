
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of bread hard as a rock, and a rusty sword – were all that stood between me and the rumored riches of the lost city of Eldoria. Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, yet the thrill of the unknown fueled my weary steps. This journey, fraught with peril, held the promise of glory and fortune – or a swift and brutal end.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped to warp speed.  Orion's nebula, a swirling tapestry of cosmic dust and gas, painted the viewscreen in breathtaking hues. Our mission: to locate the lost colony ship, the Icarus, vanished without a trace decades ago at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, pressed in on me. The weight of the unknown – the potential dangers of uncharted systems, the possibility of alien encounters – was palpable. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to uncover the Icarus's fate, spurred us onward into the unfathomable depths of the cosmos.
