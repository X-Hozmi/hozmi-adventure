
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tightly in her calloused hand.  The scent of rosemary and thyme fought with the ever-present stench of sweat and unwashed bodies among her fellow travelers.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the phantom whispers of the Black Death still haunted the land.  Her quest, to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, was a perilous one, reliant on the kindness of strangers, the strength of her spirit, and the capriciousness of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Razor" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of swirling gases and distant starlight.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, pirate attacks from the notorious Kryll Syndicate, and the creeping loneliness of interstellar travel. But the promise of new life, new civilizations, and the thrill of charting the unknown fueled her engine and kept her heart blazing, a testament to humanity's enduring thirst for adventure among the stars.
