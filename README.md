
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, swallowed the sound of their hooves.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a constant reminder of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a counterpoint to the silence of space, broken only by the crackle of comms and the rhythmic beeping of the navigation system.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval expeditions, the promise of discovery tempered by the ever-present danger of asteroid fields, hostile alien life, and the unforgiving nature of interstellar travel.
