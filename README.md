
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth range a formidable silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile map leading to the legendary Sunstone city, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the wild itself.  Her journey was a tapestry woven from grit, determination, and the hope of a miracle.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, Ryla and her crew faced not bandits, but cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a canvas painted with nebulae and starlight, mirroring the endless possibilities and inherent dangers of their daring expedition.
