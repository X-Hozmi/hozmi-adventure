
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs, a chipped flint, and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the relentless sun beat down, but the whisper of adventure, the promise of the unknown, spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk cry, was a chapter in her unfolding saga, a testament to the courage it took to cross continents in a time when the world felt both vast and impossibly small.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor sentient life unlike anything humanity had encountered.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation relied on complex astrogation charts and the whims of unpredictable wormholes.  The constant hum of the ship's engines, a counterpoint to the silent expanse, was her constant companion on this interstellar pilgrimage.  The stakes were higher than ever – the fate of two civilizations, perhaps, hung in the balance.
