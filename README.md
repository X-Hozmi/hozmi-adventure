
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate plains.  Their journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, punctuated only by the creak of saddle leather, the occasional bark of a stray dog, and the hushed whispers of fellow pilgrims sharing tales of bandits and miracles.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new hardship, but also the thrill of the unknown, the unwavering belief that beyond the next hill lay a destination worthy of their arduous trek – a holy city shimmering with hope and salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been smoother than anticipated, but the alien landscapes waiting below promised challenges of a different kind.  Lyra's mission: to establish first contact with a sentient species, a daunting task tempered by the awe-inspiring beauty of unexplored galaxies and the camaraderie of her diverse crew, each a specialist in their own field, bound together by the shared desire for discovery and the relentless pull of the unknown.
