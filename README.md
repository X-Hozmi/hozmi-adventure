
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, more faded wish than reliable guide, offered little comfort against the looming threat of bandits or the unforgiving terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through her as she pressed onward, driven by a desperate need to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance and will, but the hope of healing fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents between galaxies demanded precision and courage, a constant dance with cosmic anomalies and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from a remote planet on the edge of known space, a perilous undertaking vital to the survival of her people.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, Ryla faced the constant threat of system failures, pirate attacks, and the terrifying unknown that lurked in the vast emptiness between worlds.
