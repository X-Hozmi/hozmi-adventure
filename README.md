
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  She clutched the worn leather satchel containing her family's last hope – a legendary herb rumored to cure the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through her, but the burning desire to reach the monastery on the other side fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the thrill of discovery and the potential for galactic-altering advancements outweighed the risks.  The vast expanse of space, a tapestry of celestial wonders and hidden dangers, held both an alluring beauty and a chilling unpredictability that kept Jaxx perpetually on edge.
