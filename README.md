
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, more faded smudges than precise cartography, was her only guide to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria’s untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, her heart a drum against her ribs, a rhythm echoing the relentless beat of her weary horse's hooves.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Khan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the Galactic Federation, a celestial anomaly whispered about in hushed tones across the known universes.  Navigation was treacherous, demanding precise calculations and a keen eye for the unpredictable jumps of hyperspace.  The dangers were not bandits and disease, but rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions.  Yet, the promise of galactic peace and the thrill of uncharted territories fueled Nova's resolve, her determination a beacon in the vast, inky blackness.
