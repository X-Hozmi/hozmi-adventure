
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the forest teemed with unseen dangers, and every rickety bridge felt like a gamble with death.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred them on, the promise of spiritual solace and tales to tell fueling their weary limbs.  They were travellers, not tourists, their adventure woven into the very fabric of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system and locate a rumored source of rare Xylanium crystals.  The journey was far removed from the medieval trials of Sir Reginald, yet shared a kinship in its inherent risk.  Asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels made each hyperspace jump a gamble, the vast emptiness a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the grandeur of the cosmos.
