
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests whispered of ambushes, and the whispers of the plague hung heavy in the air, a more insidious enemy than any robber baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet curtain of space, its trajectory aimed at the Andromeda galaxy.  Years of hyperspace travel blurred into a montage of nebulae and distant suns.  The challenges weren't bandits or disease, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the ever-present threat of space debris, and the chilling emptiness of interstellar void.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, of charting unmapped constellations, spurred her onward, a relentless explorer in a vast, unforgiving cosmos.
