
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she spurred her horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, held more than just provisions; it held the weight of her family's legacy, a desperate quest to reach the rumored monastery at the edge of the known world, where a cure for the creeping plague might reside.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, danger, and the slim hope of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts glowed on the bridge, plotting a course through nebulae and past uncharted star systems.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a remote, hostile planet, a journey fraught with the perils of alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on intergalactic trade routes.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of thrill, a breathtaking expanse of unknown possibilities, both terrifying and exhilarating.
