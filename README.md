
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching Avignon before winter’s grip tightened.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the lure of the legendary lost city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, but also whispered dangers of unknown flora and fauna.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the distant glow of distant galaxies, was a different kind of wilderness, yet the thrill of discovery, the risk of the unknown, burned just as brightly as it had for Elara centuries ago.
