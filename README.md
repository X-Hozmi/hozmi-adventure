
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming faintly under the pale sun, guided his weary horse eastward.  His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the blighted lands.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the rumble of his horse's hooves on rutted tracks, the sting of rain, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a renewed hope that spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the distant Solara system and the newly discovered Kepler-186f. The vast expanse of space, dotted with glittering stars and mysterious celestial phenomena, presented its own unique dangers—unstable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life. Yet, the allure of exploration, the promise of new worlds and untold riches, fueled her journey across the galaxy.
