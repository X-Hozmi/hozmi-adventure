
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in fiery hues.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague followed her every step.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the untamed wilderness, propelled her forward, each creak of her saddle a heartbeat against the vast, echoing silence of the plains.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of neon across the cockpit.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies, a tiny speck defying the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.  The mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the Xylos system, a journey that promised not only untold riches, but also a face-off with the notorious pirate lord, Zarthus, and the treacherous gravity wells of the Black Maw nebula.  The universe was his battlefield, and the ultimate adventure lay just beyond the next warp jump.
