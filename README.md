
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, barely guides her through the dense forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, threatens to unveil bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the Black Death's creeping shadow.  Survival depends on her wit, her courage, and the kindness of strangers encountered along this perilous journey to find a rumored cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  His mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet of Aethel.  The jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a chaotic ballet of swirling colors and gravitational forces that could crush the ship. Beyond Xylos lie uncharted sectors, rumored to house ancient alien ruins and unpredictable space anomalies.  His crew's lives, and the future of Aethel, hinge on the successful completion of this interstellar voyage.
