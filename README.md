
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits a constant companion.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new landscapes – sprawling vineyards, ancient ruins whispering forgotten histories, and bustling market towns overflowing with the exotic spices and silks of the East.  Yet with every breathtaking vista comes the risk of ambush, disease, or simply the unforgiving nature of the land itself.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy, its destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun.  We, a team of xeno-archaeologists, journey across light-years in search of ancient alien civilizations, braving asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravitational currents, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted space.  Each jump through hyperspace promises the discovery of wonders beyond human comprehension, but also the potential for encounters with the unpredictable and hostile forces that inhabit the vast emptiness between the stars.
