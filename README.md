
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – precious grains for a famine-stricken village hundreds of leagues away.  Each creaking step of her weary steed, each wary glance at the shadowed valleys, represents a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Her journey is a tapestry woven with the grit of survival and the hope of a future harvest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan charts a course through the nebula of Xylos, his starship a sleek dart against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Nird, a world teeming with volatile creatures and guarded by a technologically superior alien race.  Hyperspace jumps are risky, navigation a constant battle against unforeseen celestial events, and the threat of pirates lurks in every dark corner of the galaxy.  Yet, for Rexx, the thrill of the unknown, the challenge of pushing boundaries, fuels the engine of his extraordinary voyage.
