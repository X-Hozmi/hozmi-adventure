
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for excitement, peril, and the tantalizing whisper of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of her isolation.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of finding survivors, fueled her determination.  Each jump was a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying grandeur of the cosmos.
