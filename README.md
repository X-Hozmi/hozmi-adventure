
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across Europe, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales whispered in taverns.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a fresh wave of determination propelled her forward, fueled by faith and the yearning to reach her destination.  Every ache in her bones, every hardship endured, etched itself onto her soul as a testament to her grit and the raw, untamed beauty of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaron navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning interstellar civilization.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Jax faced dangers far removed from bandits and disease; rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life forms.  But the vast, star-dusted expanse held a different kind of allure – the thrill of discovery, the promise of new worlds, and the profound solitude of space, a stark contrast to the densely populated worlds she'd left behind.
