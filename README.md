
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for ambush, be it from bandits, wild beasts, or the sickness itself.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, moments of breathtaking beauty, and the ever-present shadow of uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space held both wonder and peril, the stars themselves a silent witness to the intrepid journey across the cosmic ocean.
