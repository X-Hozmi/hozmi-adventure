
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest was proving more perilous than any battlefield.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the path was choked with fallen timber, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, brimming with ancient magic and untold riches, spurred him and his small band relentlessly westward, through blizzards and scorching heat, each sunrise bringing a new test of their courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the risk of encountering unknown celestial phenomena a constant threat.  Faster-than-light travel strained the ship’s systems, and the isolation took its toll on the crew, but the possibility of finding a new home, a beacon of hope amidst the dying embers of Earth, fueled their unwavering determination.
