
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with peril and unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal barely clinging to the static.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became commonplace, while the endless expanse of space pressed in, a constant reminder of the vast distances and unforgiving nature of interstellar travel. Yet, the faint hope of finding survivors, of bringing a lost civilization back into the fold, was a beacon guiding their perilous journey across the cosmos.
