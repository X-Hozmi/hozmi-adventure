
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, swift rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  Every crackling fire, every shared loaf of bread, cemented their bond as they pushed further into the unknown heart of the world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent hues.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the loneliness of space was a constant companion.  Each jump between star systems was a gamble, a leap of faith into the void, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the stark beauty of cosmic wonders – nebulae painted across the black canvas, planets shimmering like jewels, and the silent majesty of distant galaxies.
