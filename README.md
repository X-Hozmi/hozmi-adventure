
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored city of Ys, a pilgrimage whispered of in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling to their doom, and the ever-present fear of disease and starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of ancient magic, pushed her forward, each step a gamble against the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla "Comet" Thorne steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the Kryll Hegemony's territory.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of warp-speed travel and calculated risk.  The vastness of space, the silent threat of pirate ships, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien lifeforms unknown – all were just another day's work for a seasoned spacefarer like Ryla.
