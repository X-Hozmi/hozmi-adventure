
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the hill, the sun a molten orb sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her worn map, a testament to weeks of relentless travel, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown – the potential for bandits, the promise of breathtaking vistas, and the ever-present fear of the unforgiving wilderness.  Survival depended on her wits, her endurance, and the kindness of strangers in a world both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally harsh.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, a journey fraught with dangers ranging from rogue asteroids to hostile alien patrols.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, instilled a different kind of fear – the isolating loneliness of the cosmos and the ever-present threat of the unknown. Yet,  the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories light-years from Earth, fueled her unwavering determination.
