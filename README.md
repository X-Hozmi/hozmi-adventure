
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sprawl of Carcassonne a shimmering mirage in the midday heat.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a dangerous mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this harsh, unforgiving landscape.  Survival itself was the ultimate adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The ship bucked against the gravitational forces of a nearby brown dwarf, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant thrum against the silence of deep space.  Alien encounters were a constant possibility,  the unknown dangers of uncharted space a thrill as exhilarating as it was terrifying.  The vastness of the cosmos offered boundless adventure, but only for the brave.
