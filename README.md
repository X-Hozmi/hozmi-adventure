
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her and her meager pack.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome was a treacherous one, rife with bandits lurking in shadowed forests, swollen rivers threatening to sweep travelers away, and the ever-present gnawing fear of disease.  Yet, the pilgrimage was her life's purpose, a quest for spiritual solace and a chance to escape the stifling grip of her village.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new breathtaking vista, a new brush with the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with the hum of the Alcubierre drive.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, was far removed from Elara's perilous trek, but equally fraught with danger.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms kept Eva on edge.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, spurred her onward, fueled by the hope of a new dawn for humanity amongst the stars.
