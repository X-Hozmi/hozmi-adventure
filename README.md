
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a thrilling mix of hope and fear as he navigated the unknown, his loyal squire ever at his side.  The whispered legends of mythical beasts and hidden cities only fueled his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and treacherous asteroid fields.  Navigating through wormholes and dodging space pirates, Eva relied on her trusty crew and advanced technology to push the boundaries of known space.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving emptiness of interstellar travel.
