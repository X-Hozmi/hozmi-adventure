
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under a bruised sky, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him on, a solitary knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the intergalactic void.   Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and facing the existential dread of the infinite, Eva and her crew pressed on, their journey a testament to humanity’s relentless pursuit of knowledge and survival amidst the breathtaking and terrifying grandeur of the cosmos.
