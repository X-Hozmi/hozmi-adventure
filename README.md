
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped waterskin, a well-thumbed map, and the whispered promise of a fabled city hidden deep within the whispering woods. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger were her constant companions, but the lure of the unknown – a lost civilization, untold riches, perhaps even a cure for her ailing brother – kept her ever onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation system.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Faster-than-light travel had opened the cosmos, yet the perils were no less daunting.  Pirate raids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities made each journey a gamble, a thrilling dance between survival and the insatiable human hunger for discovery.
