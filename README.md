
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s worn leather boots crunched on the parched earth. His retinue, a ragtag band of knights and squires, trailed behind, their faces grim under the relentless sun.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had stretched for months, fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their mettle. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's enchanted forests and shimmering spires spurred them onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a grueling five-year voyage aboard a generation ship, had tested the crew's resilience, not with bandits or starvation, but with the psychological strain of isolation and the constant hum of the hyperdrive. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, fueled their relentless quest across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
