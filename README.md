He was bound for the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape. The promise of Eldoria, however, fueled his resolve, driving him further into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal dangers.  Faster-than-light travel had opened the cosmos, but the vastness of space remained a formidable opponent.  Navigation glitches, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested Eva's skill and courage as she navigated the treacherous expanse between stars, the fate of her crew and the future of her planet hanging in the balance.
