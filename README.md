
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that clung to him.  He carried a sealed scroll, a message of vital importance to the King, a journey fraught with peril that led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and finally, into the heart of a warring kingdom. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, threatened to unravel his mission, and the weight of his responsibility pressed heavy upon him.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust a stark backdrop to the distant, sapphire glow of her destination – the Kepler-186f system.  Her mission: to retrieve a crucial bio-sample from a planet teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  The journey across galaxies tested the ship's limits and her crew's nerves.  Hyperspace jumps were perilous leaps of faith, and the constant threat of space pirates added another layer of risk to their already demanding task. The vastness of space itself, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion on their epic voyage.
