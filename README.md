
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  He carried with him only a worn map, a dwindling supply of dried meat, and an unshakeable belief in the legend.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the constant, exhilarating risk of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic K'tharr civilization on the planet Xylos IV, a world light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy storms was child's play compared to the political intrigue and potential hostility awaiting her.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the immense distances and perilous unknowns she faced in her pursuit of first contact and the expansion of humanity's reach across the galaxy.
