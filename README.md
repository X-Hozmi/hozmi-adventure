
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather jerkin chafing against her skin.  The journey to Avignon was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unpredictable rivers could easily sweep away the unwary. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new vista, a new challenge, a new possibility – a chance encounter with a wandering minstrel, a harrowing crossing of a treacherous mountain pass, the hushed awe of a cathedral rising against the skyline.  Her destination was a mystery, a whispered promise of fortune or freedom, pulling her ever closer.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Janson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and hidden dangers.  Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a cluster of planets promising untold resources and scientific breakthroughs. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily test of skill and nerve, punctuated by the thrill of discovering uncharted celestial bodies. The vastness of space, a terrifying and wondrous expanse, held both the promise of breathtaking discoveries and the ever-present threat of the unknown, an alien landscape as challenging and unforgiving as any medieval wilderness.
