
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange. Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the unwavering hope of healing spurred her on, transforming the arduous journey into a thrilling, perilous adventure across a vast and unforgiving land.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  This wasn't a quest for a cure, but for knowledge – the potential for a new life for humanity among the stars.  The cosmos held infinite wonders and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, a seasoned explorer, embraced the challenge, her spirit fueled by the boundless possibilities of interstellar travel.
