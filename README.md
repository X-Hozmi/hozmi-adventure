
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The King's summons, a desperate plea for aid against a rebellious baron, had thrust him into a journey across treacherous highlands and whispering forests.  Each day brought fresh challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating bandits' ambushes, and enduring the relentless gaze of the ever-present stars, a silent witness to his arduous trek.  The promise of glory and the weight of duty propelled him forward, a lone knight against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the forgotten planet of Aethel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory drones of the Kryll Empire was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure the energy source.  Across the galaxy, the stakes were high, and Eva, armed with her wits and cutting-edge technology, was humanity's last hope, a lone adventurer in the boundless expanse of space.
