
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city whispered to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the legends, the rumors of unimaginable riches and power, fuelled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a hunt for treasure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering unknown alien life forms were mere inconveniences compared to the existential threat of dwindling resources.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted depths of the cosmos. The vastness of space was terrifying, yet the possibility of a new beginning, of finding a second home for humanity, burned brighter than any star.
