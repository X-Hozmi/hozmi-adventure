
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried rations; it holds the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of freedom from the suffocating grip of her arranged marriage.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the ever-present uncertainty of the road. But the thrill of the unknown, the fiery independence burning in her heart, outweighs the fear. This journey, fraught with danger and hardship, is her adventure, her escape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The hum of the engines, the constant vigilance against asteroid fields and unknown anomalies, is the price of exploration.  Yet, the pursuit of knowledge, the chance to discover new life and new worlds, fuels her relentless journey across the galaxy.  This is a different kind of adventure, but the spirit of exploration burns just as brightly.
