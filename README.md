
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and encounters with bandits and desperate villagers.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new danger, and each sunset the grim reality of a journey far from over, its end still shrouded in the uncertainties of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory spacefaring creatures of the Xylos system, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to overcome the vast distances and unpredictable dangers of interstellar travel.  The universe, a boundless expanse of wonder and peril, held the answer – but reaching it demanded courage and unwavering determination.
