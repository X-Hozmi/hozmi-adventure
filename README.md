
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor rattling, urged his weary steed onward.  The map, stained with sweat and rain, promised riches and glory in the distant Sultanate of Delhi, but the reality was a relentless march through hostile territory. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the unforgiving landscape tested both man and beast. Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present hope of reaching their destination before winter's icy grip claimed them.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been perilous, a treacherous warp-jump through uncharted space, fraught with the risk of encountering rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational anomalies. The mission, to recover a vital artifact from a long-lost civilization, pushed her and her crew to their limits, but the allure of discovery, the thrill of exploring the unknown, outweighed the danger a thousand times over.
