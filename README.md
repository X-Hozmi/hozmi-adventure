Her journey from Canterbury to Rome, undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Yet, the breathtaking vista unfolding before her – rolling hills bathed in the golden light of sunset – rekindled the spark of hope that had almost flickered out. Each day brought new challenges, but also the unexpected kindness of strangers and the stunning beauty of a world largely untouched.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.

Navigating asteroid fields and evading the aggressive Kryll warships was child's play compared to the existential dread of the unknown. The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were constant pressures. Yet, the promise of finding the colonists, of uncovering the secrets of Kepler-186f, fueled her unwavering determination.
