
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke battling the ever-present tang of sweat and fear.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King, a desperate plea from a besieged village far to the east.  Bandits, storms, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, where the road was as dangerous as any battlefield.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The challenges were different – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, grappling with the unpredictable warp currents, and facing the unknown alien species inhabiting the fringes of explored space.  But the thrill of discovery, the vastness of the universe, and the weight of responsibility echoed the courage and resilience of those medieval travelers who journeyed before her.
