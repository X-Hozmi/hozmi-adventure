He had crossed miles of barren plains, scaled treacherous mountain passes, and braved the dangers of the Whispering Woods, all in pursuit of the legendary Sword of Aethelred.

With a rumble and a sigh, the Celestria settled onto the shimmering surface, a beacon of human ambition in the vastness of space.
