
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, a worn map clutched in her gloved hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village. Each creaking step of her weary steed, each rustle in the dense forest, held the potential for both peril and discovery.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant threats, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted across a thousand light-years to the Kepler-186f system.  Unlike Elara's journey, Rexa's was powered by technology—hyperspace jumps, automated navigation, and life support systems—but the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the black between stars.  The allure of new worlds, of uncharted territories filled with alien wonders, was a powerful current drawing her further into the vast, unknown cosmos.
