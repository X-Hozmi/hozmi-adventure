
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous, mountain pass.  Each jagged peak was a silent sentinel watching her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain a challenge in itself, but the lure of untold riches and legendary artifacts spurred her onward.  The wind carried the scent of pine and fear, a potent mix mirroring the perilous adventure that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate vessels were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lurked within the unpredictable fabric of spacetime itself. The weight of the missing colonists, and the promise of uncovering a lost technological marvel, fueled his journey across the vast cosmic ocean.
