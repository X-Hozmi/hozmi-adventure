
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, a knight newly returned from the Crusades, finds himself far from the familiar battlefields of the Holy Land.  A cryptic map, whispered to him by a dying Saracen, promises untold riches hidden within the treacherous Black Forest.  His journey is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in shadowed glens, wolves howl in the moonlit nights, and the whispers of ancient magic cling to the gnarled trees.  Each day brings a new challenge – fording raging rivers, scaling treacherous mountains, and navigating by the stars, all while evading the unwanted attention of rival knights and unscrupulous merchants.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faces dangers far removed from medieval knights: rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of warp-core instability.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of charting unmapped nebulae and encountering new life forms, drives them onward, their journey a testament to the enduring human spirit of exploration, albeit light years away from the forests and fields of the medieval age.
