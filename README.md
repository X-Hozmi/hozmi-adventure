
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Black Forest promised both shelter and untold peril.  Rumours of brigands and mythical beasts whispered on the wind, a chilling counterpoint to the jingle of his saddlebags, heavy with the King's commission:  a sacred relic stolen from a monastery high in the Alps. His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, each sunrise bringing the promise of adventure, and each nightfall the chilling threat of unforeseen disaster.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways. Captain Elara, her face etched with the harsh beauty of countless solar flares, guided her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a rumoured paradise lost to time.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was routine, but the allure of the unknown, the thrill of discovering a new world, burned brighter than any supernova.  The galaxy was vast, and her journey, a quest for both scientific discovery and personal redemption.
