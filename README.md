
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each day brought new perils: treacherous passes, skirmishes with brigands, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Ys's untold riches and arcane knowledge, fueled his weary bones, driving him ever closer to his perilous destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport, and the sheer audacity of her expedition ignited a thrill in her, a sense of adventure as boundless as the cosmos itself.
