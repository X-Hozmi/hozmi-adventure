
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city of gold and forgotten magic.  His journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unpredictable terrain tested both man and beast.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the promise of untold riches and adventure, burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space. The vast expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and dread;  uncharted systems teemed with unpredictable celestial phenomena, and the threat of pirate raiders remained a constant concern.  But the chance to uncover the fate of the lost colonists, and perhaps discover new worlds beyond human comprehension, fuelled her relentless journey through the star-strewn void.
