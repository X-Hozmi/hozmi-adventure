
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the breadth of Francia was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fragile victory against the elements and the unseen dangers that stalked her path – a desperate search for a rumored healer, a quest fueled by hope and fueled by grit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage across unimaginable distances and through fields of cosmic radiation.  The thrill of discovery warred with the ever-present threat of uncharted celestial anomalies and the silent, terrifying vastness of space. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, every planetary survey a potential encounter with the unknown – alien landscapes and potentially hostile civilizations.
