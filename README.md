
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the endless expanse of the Sahara.  Bandits, scorching sun, and dwindling water supplies were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the whispered tales of Zerzura's lost libraries and untold riches fueled her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each shifting dune, held the promise of discovery, a thrilling gamble against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and establish contact with its sentient lifeforms.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of hyperdrives, the hiss of space dust against the hull, and the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and avoid pirate incursions.  The unknown stretched before them, a vast ocean of stars promising both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers in equal measure.
