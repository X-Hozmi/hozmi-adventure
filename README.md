
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward.  The midday sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth of the King's Road, a ribbon of barely-there track snaking through sun-baked fields and desolate forests.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both danger and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape itself.  This journey, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, was her only hope.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast distances, the unpredictable gravitational fields, and the potential for encountering unknown alien lifeforms presented a constant challenge.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of space.  But the promise of new worlds, of new beginnings, fueled her unwavering determination.
