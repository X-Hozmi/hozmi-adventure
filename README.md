
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life in the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of perilous adventure, a constant reminder of the wild, unpredictable nature of the medieval world. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the promise of reaching her destination fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a stark contrast to the grounded dangers of the medieval era.  While pirates were still a threat, they now piloted sleek fighters instead of crude galleons.  The challenges were different – navigating asteroid fields, managing energy reserves, battling alien lifeforms – but the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, remained a timeless human drive.
