
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, the only sounds the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each ford, each treacherous mountain pass, represented a gamble with fate, but the hope of salvation spurred him on, a knight errant against a far more formidable foe than any earthly army.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies. The hyperdrive hummed, a low thrum that vibrated through the ship’s frame as they jumped between nebulae, each jump a calculated risk in the unpredictable currents of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying planet.  The vast emptiness of space held dangers far more alien and unpredictable than any medieval battlefield, but the hope of survival for her people propelled her forward into the cosmic unknown.
