
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to her worn cloak.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery on the far side of the Black Forest, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, famine, or the chilling breath of the plague. Yet, with every sunrise, her unwavering determination pushed her onward, fueled by the hope of a reunion, a hope that burned brighter than the setting sun.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the fringes of known space.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory raids of K'tharr pirates was merely a Tuesday for Ryla. But the loneliness of interstellar travel, the weight of her crew's survival resting on her shoulders, was a burden even faster-than-light travel couldn't outrun.
