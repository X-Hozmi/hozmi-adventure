
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the Duke – was fraught with peril, each shadow a potential enemy, each ford a gamble against the swollen river.  The clinking of his meager possessions – a few silver coins, a blessed amulet, and the sealed parchment – was a constant reminder of the stakes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the universe’s secrets, fueled her journey across the star-strewn void, a voyage infinitely more challenging, yet arguably no less perilous, than Thomas's medieval trek.
