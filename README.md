
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the unpredictable weather threatened starvation, and disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, with each arduous mile, her determination hardened, fueled by the whispered hope of reaching her destination and finding salvation.  The road was long, but the unwavering love for her brother lit her path.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a journey across the vast expanse of the Milky Way.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling unpredictable space anomalies was commonplace.  The loneliness of deep space was a constant companion, yet the thought of the colony's survival, the possibility of bringing life to another world, spurred her on.  The cosmos held endless wonders and terrors, but for Ryla, the thrill of exploration outweighed the inherent risks.
