
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a map – ancient, brittle, and hinting at a fabled city lost to the mists of time – and the courage born of necessity.  Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown spurred her on, a burning ember in the heart of a young woman determined to write her own legend.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Khan piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the rumored Xylos civilization, said to possess technology capable of bridging intergalactic distances.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and the ever-present risk of encountering uncharted anomalies presented challenges far removed from Elara’s, but the thrill of exploration, the endless possibilities waiting amongst the stars, fueled Nova's journey as powerfully as any earthly ambition.
