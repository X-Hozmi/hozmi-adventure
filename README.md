The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, each twist promising both danger and discovery.  Rumors of a lost city, filled with forgotten magic and untold riches, fueled his journey.  Bandits, wild beasts, and treacherous terrain were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of the unknown, the allure of a legend waiting to be unearthed.

The risk of encountering unpredictable stellar phenomena, or worse, hostile alien life, was ever-present. Yet, the chance to expand human knowledge, to chart uncharted territories amongst the stars, was a siren song too captivating to resist.
