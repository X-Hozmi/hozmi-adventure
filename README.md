
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden highlands towards the rumored city of Eldoria was fraught with peril. Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow cast by the setting sun, threatened to unveil ambush or worse.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, his only guide through this unforgiving landscape; a promise of riches and adventure fueling his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the occasional asteroid field, offered a different kind of peril than Thomas's journey. Here, the threat wasn't bandits, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the silent danger of cosmic radiation, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.
