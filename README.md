
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but a stolen map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death stalk her journey, testing her courage and resourcefulness at every turn.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, sends a thrill of both fear and exhilaration down her spine. This arduous trek, fraught with peril, is the very essence of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*. Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable power rumored to exist on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps through space-time are risky, pirates lurk in the shadows of asteroid fields, and unknown alien entities could be lurking in unexplored sectors. Yet, the allure of the Crystal, and the promise of untold discoveries, fuels her journey across the cosmic ocean, a voyage far more perilous, yet equally thrilling, than any medieval quest.
