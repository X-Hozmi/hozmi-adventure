
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The quest – a mythical, sun-stone rumored to hold unimaginable power – led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-infested forests, and across rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each sunrise brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, starving peasants desperate for coin, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of glory and the promise of the sun-stone fueled his relentless journey, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval adventurers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden spacetime anomaly. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravity wells of dying stars was commonplace.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of peril – the creeping isolation and the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed on, driven by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance.
