
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the unforgiving desert, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the shifting sands. Every landmark, every whispered rumour from weary travellers, fuelled her relentless pursuit of the legendary city, a journey etching itself onto her soul as deeply as the desert sun onto her skin.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, was fraught with peril; unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders stalked the hyperspace lanes.  The thrill of exploration, the vastness of the unknown, and the hope of discovering a new home for humanity – these were the winds that propelled her forward, a testament to human resilience amidst the breathtaking indifference of the universe.
