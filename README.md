
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in stolen relics, the price of her escape from a crumbling abbey and the wrath of a vengeful abbot.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpened her senses, reminding her of the dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present fear of being discovered.  Her journey was a desperate gamble, a race against time and the relentless pursuit of men determined to reclaim their prize.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Khan steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the nebula known as the Whispering Veil.  Her mission: to retrieve a lost data core containing the coordinates to a legendary, energy-rich planet.  Navigation through the treacherous cosmic currents tested the ship’s limits, while the ever-present threat of pirate raiders from the Kryll Hegemony kept her crew on edge.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty but held a chilling indifference, a constant reminder that a single malfunction could mean oblivion amidst the infinite starlight.
