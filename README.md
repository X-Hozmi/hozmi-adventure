
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both rider and beast tumbling into the abyss, and whispers of a ravenous beast guarding a crucial river crossing chilled her to the bone.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the unwavering gleam of Ys in her heart fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in perpetual twilight.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of a rival corporation's sleek warships tested her skills to the limit.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, yet held equal measure of terrifying unknowns. The fate of her crew, and possibly humanity itself, rested on her shoulders as she charted a course towards the unknown.
