
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward through the muddy track.  Each sunrise brought the chilling promise of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to lie hidden in the faraway kingdom of Eldoria, spurred us on.  The creak of saddle leather and the rhythmic beat of horses' hooves were the soundtrack to our desperate quest, each mile a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainties of the medieval world.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a far cry from the clop of horseshoes.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the uncharted galaxy of Andromeda.  The mission: to locate a rumored planet teeming with Xylanium, a substance vital to sustaining life beyond Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of stars and the occasional meteor shower, held a different kind of peril than bandits or disease.  Here, the threat was cosmic – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present unknown of the universe.
