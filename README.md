
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, squinted at the setting sun.  Weeks of arduous travel had taken him and his small band across treacherous mountain passes and through dense, wolf-infested forests. Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a message that could mean the difference between war and peace.  Each creak of their saddlebags, each rustle in the undergrowth, felt charged with the weight of their mission, the vastness of the land a constant reminder of the dangers that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey across the galaxy was far removed from Reginald's, yet the sense of isolation and the constant awareness of peril remained.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships were the price of interstellar travel.  Her mission, to locate a rare mineral vital for galactic peace, demanded courage and precision; the vast emptiness of space, filled with its own silent threats, mirrored the challenges of a far-off medieval quest.
