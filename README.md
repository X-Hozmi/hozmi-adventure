
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched plains, the midday sun beating down on her chainmail.  Her destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought its own peril – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, sudden sandstorms that threatened to bury her alive, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of defying the odds, pushed her onward, spurred by dreams of glory and the hope of finding her missing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Kerrigan steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a perilous one, fraught with asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Nova, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, was undeterred.  The promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a new beginning for humanity, fueled her unwavering resolve, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
