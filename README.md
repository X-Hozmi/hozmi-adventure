
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow stinging her nostrils.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King's court.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present fear of the unknown were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a test of both physical and mental endurance. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the fragile hope that tomorrow would bring her closer to her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly creatures.  While the dangers were different – alien predators and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – the spirit of adventure remained the same, a relentless pursuit of the unknown fueled by courage, skill, and an unyielding desire to overcome the impossible.
