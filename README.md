
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his horse weary, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him across treacherous mountain passes, through sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and across rivers swollen with spring melt.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – felt as endless as the dusty road stretching before him.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, and each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered.  The weight of his duty, and the promise of a reward, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of space.  While she lacked the immediate physical threats of bandits, the void itself presented a constant challenge – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration, fueled her onward, a descendant of those medieval adventurers, but with a galaxy instead of a kingdom as her stage.
