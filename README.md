
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zamora, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, with each creak of her saddle and each breath of crisp mountain air, the allure of the unknown fueled her onward, a relentless ember in the heart of a solitary adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Navigation across the intergalactic void was a dance with gravity wells, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Her mission: to chart unexplored star systems and locate the mythical Xylos Crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were unimaginable, the distances incomprehensible, but the promise of unlocking a new era of galactic exploration burned brighter than any star in the inky black.
