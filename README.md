
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent winding through the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, creaked under the weight of silks, spices, and the hopes of a dozen weary souls.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of dysentery, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching desert.  Yet, with every mile, the thrill of the unknown spurred us onward – the promise of Constantinople's bustling markets, a whispered tale of a lost city hidden in the mountains, and the sheer exhilaration of defying the vast, unpredictable landscape. This journey, fraught with peril, was life itself, distilled into sweat, dust, and the unwavering spirit of adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves beckon.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the Andromeda Galaxy, its hyperdrive humming a song of impossible speeds.  Each jump takes us light-years away, to planets bathed in the alien glow of nebulae, or orbiting pulsars that spin their deadly rhythms.  The dangers are different now—cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the silent menace of unexplored space—but the hunger for discovery remains the same.  The vast emptiness between worlds, once a boundary, is now our playground, each new system a potential treasure trove of wonders, each unexplored planet a siren's call to the brave.
