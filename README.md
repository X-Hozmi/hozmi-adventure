
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her satchel, crammed with dried meats and a well-worn map, held more than provisions; it contained her hopes for a new life, a life beyond the shadowed valley where famine stalked her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of both danger and the exhilarating unknown – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving terrain were small prices to pay for the chance of a better future.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos system a breathtaking sight from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the galaxy, seeking new habitable worlds for a burgeoning interstellar civilization.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the vibrant colors of alien star clusters and the ghostly luminescence of distant quasars, held a different kind of danger than Elara's journey, but the thrill of discovery – of pushing the boundaries of the known universe – burned just as brightly within him.
