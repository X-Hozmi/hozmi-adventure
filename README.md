
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices, a map promising untold wealth in a distant city, and a heart heavy with the fear of bandits, starvation, and the unknown.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, sent a fresh shiver down his spine.  This journey across the ravaged lands of Europe was a gamble, a desperate attempt to escape the suffocating poverty of his village, a desperate hope for a better life.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of the cosmos outside her viewport.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions – the thrill of exploration, the pull of the unknown, remained the same, a primal human urge transcending time and space.
