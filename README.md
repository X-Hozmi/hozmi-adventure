
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance.  Her journey from Prague has been arduous – bandits waylaid her caravan in the Black Forest, forcing a desperate flight through treacherous mountain passes.  Days blurred into a relentless cycle of sun-scorched plains and rain-soaked valleys, each sunrise bringing new challenges: navigating confusing forest paths, bartering for meager provisions in isolated villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for threats, both human and natural.  Yet, the promise of reaching Avignon, a city teeming with scholars and knowledge, fuels her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of Kepler-186f a distant memory.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across vast interstellar distances, a tiny speck against the breathtaking tapestry of the cosmos.  The journey hasn't been without peril – a near-collision with a rogue asteroid field left the hull scarred, and a hyperspace anomaly threatened to tear their ship apart.  But the allure of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, outweighs the risks.  The galaxy awaits, a vast, unexplored frontier beckoning the brave and the bold.
