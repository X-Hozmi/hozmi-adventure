
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of legend, spurred him on, each hardship forging him into a tougher, more resolute traveler.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across uncharted star systems fraught with cosmic anomalies and pirate raids.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions became commonplace; the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of both the immense distances and the profound isolation of interstellar travel.  But the potential discovery of a new civilization, the promise of untold knowledge, fueled her unwavering determination.
