
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the churned earth.  Her journey from York to Jerusalem was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry; it was a grueling test of endurance, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge:  fording swollen rivers, navigating dense forests, bartering for meager rations in dusty villages. Yet, with every hardship, her resolve hardened, fueled by the fervent belief in reaching her destination, a pilgrimage she had sworn to undertake.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission:  to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task demanding both unparalleled navigational skills and unwavering courage.  The vast emptiness of space was a constant companion, punctuated by the breathtaking spectacle of distant suns and alien planets shimmering like jewels in the cosmic dark.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – the spirit of adventure remained the same, a driving force propelling her across the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
