
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and a worn map, felt a familiar weight against her back.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, nestled deep within the untamed wilderness, pushed her onward. Each day brought new challenges: treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with hostile villagers, and the constant gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled her journey, promising a reward far greater than any earthly possession.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  Vast distances separated him from Earth, his destination a whisper in the galactic void: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  The journey was not measured in days but in subjective years, spent battling asteroid fields, navigating treacherous wormholes, and battling the loneliness of interstellar space. But Jax's resolve held, fueled by the hopes of billions and the promise of a new beginning for a species teetering on the precipice of extinction. The cosmos presented an unimaginable challenge, but the allure of a new world outweighed any danger.
