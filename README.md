
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary horses crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Scottish Highlands stretching before them.  Their quest: to recover the stolen relic of St. Giles, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden passes, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts tested their courage and resilience.  Each day brought new challenges, from navigating by the stars to bartering for meager supplies in remote villages, forging an unbreakable bond between the knight and his loyal squire amidst the breathtaking, brutal beauty of their adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, both enthralled and intimidated her, a stark contrast to the tightly controlled environment of her spaceship,  but the potential to create a new home for humanity fueled her unwavering determination.
