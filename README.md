
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day is a gamble; bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of war echo across the plains.  Yet, the hope of salvation fuels her onward, each sunrise a new challenge in her desperate, perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet of Aethel, a world rumored to hold both unimaginable riches and deadly alien life.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the dangers of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering hostile alien factions are ever-present.  Eva's crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, rely on their skill and courage as they venture into the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human exploration across the vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
