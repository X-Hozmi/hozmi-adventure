
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and fear clinging to the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, guided her towards the rumored City of Gold, a fabled metropolis hidden deep within the uncharted lands beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unknown all lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Navigation lights pulsed across the bridge as the ship jumped through the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, gazed out at the swirling nebulae, their faces etched with a mixture of awe and apprehension. The destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel, a prize worth risking the unfathomable dangers of the cosmic expanse.
