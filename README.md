
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid from a distant kingdom.  Each rocky pass and rushing river presented a new peril, from bandits lurking in shadows to the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the burning sun on her face and the chill wind in her hair were nothing compared to the fire in her heart, fueling her relentless journey towards a promise of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light years from his home.  The journey wasn't measured in days, but in the slow, measured burn of the hyperdrive and the endless expanse of space.  He battled cosmic radiation storms, navigated asteroid fields with hair-raising precision, and fought off the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The risks were astronomical, but the promise of a new beginning, a new life, pushed him onward through the inky black.
