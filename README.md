
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of untold riches and legendary artifacts, pushed him ever closer to his perilous goal, a journey as much a test of endurance as of bravery.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, she led her crew through the vast expanse, facing not only the physical dangers of interstellar travel but also the gnawing uncertainty of whether they would find anything but empty space. The galaxy held its breath, awaiting the return of the intrepid explorers.
