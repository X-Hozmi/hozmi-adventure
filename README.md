
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône valley, the scent of woodsmoke and fear thick in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and hopeful scribbles, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death chilling the very air she breathed.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate quest for a legendary healing balm, her only companion the unwavering loyalty of her aging steed.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, jostling the crew and straining the ship's aging engines.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches in rare minerals and the potential for first contact with a sentient species. But the galaxy is a dangerous place, filled with pirates, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies that could strand them for millennia.  Their mission, like Elara's, was a high-stakes gamble promising unimaginable rewards – or utter annihilation.
