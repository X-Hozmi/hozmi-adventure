
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule train as it snaked across the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and herbs; it contained the King's urgent missive, a secret rendezvous with a shadowy order whispered in hushed tones.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry, betrayal, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, ever present on the wind.  Reaching her destination meant navigating treacherous mountain passes, dodging suspicious lords, and outwitting cunning spies – a perilous journey that would test her courage and cunning to their limits.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet blackness of intergalactic space.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, a nebula rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the allure of discovery, of charting the unknown reaches of the cosmos, fueled her unwavering determination, each jump through hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime itself.
