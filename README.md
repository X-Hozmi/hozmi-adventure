
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards left far behind.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey, pushing him further into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming algae to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant stars and the hum of the ship's engines, offered both breathtaking beauty and a chilling sense of isolation.  The success of the colony, and potentially the survival of humanity’s expansion beyond Earth, rested on her shoulders.
