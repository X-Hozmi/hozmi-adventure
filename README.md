
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promised riches and glory in the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowy forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing her courage and demanding every ounce of her strength.  Yet, the lure of the unknown fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through a nebula of breathtaking colours.  Her mission: to chart unmapped galaxies and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Warp drives hummed, a constant reminder of the immense distances separating her from Earth, a blue marble now a distant memory.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, unknown alien lifeforms lurked in the inky blackness, and the weight of responsibility pressed heavily upon her shoulders.   But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, kept her ever vigilant, a lone adventurer charting a course through the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
