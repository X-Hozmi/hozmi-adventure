
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he spurred it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each rustle in the undergrowth held the promise of peril – bandits, disease, or the untamed wilderness itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a gamble against the odds with the fate of his people hanging in the balance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily routine, the vast emptiness of space punctuated only by the hum of her ship's engines and the static crackle of her comms.  The search for a new home for humanity was a perilous voyage across the uncharted cosmos, a test of courage and technology against the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
