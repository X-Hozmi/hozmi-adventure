
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and desperation, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle for survival, a testament to the arduous nature of medieval travel, where the road was as much a challenge as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel had erased the limitations of distance, but the dangers of space remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields threatened to pulverize her vessel, rogue gravitational pulls could tear it apart, and the alien landscapes of distant planets held mysteries both wondrous and terrifying.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across the unyielding expanse of the galaxy.
