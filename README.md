
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of pine and dried earth.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists – had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests where whispers of goblins and worse things haunted the night. Each sunrise brought new dangers, but the lure of Eldoria, and the glory it promised, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace; the true peril lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump through the warp brought a gamble, but the potential for discovery – for new life, new resources, new knowledge – made the risk worthwhile for this intrepid explorer.
