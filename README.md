
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, squinted at the setting sun painting the endless steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His journey from the King's court to the distant Khanate had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of the Silk Road's hidden cities, and the promise of untold riches spurred him onward, each hardship forging him stronger, his spirit as vast as the plains themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's hull groaning under the strain of traversing the wormhole.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic hyperspace accident.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were formidable challenges, but the hope of reuniting a lost civilization, the allure of unexplored planets brimming with alien life, fueled her unwavering determination.  The stars themselves were her guide.
