The dusty track snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and ancient forests, the air thick with the scent of pine and impending adventure.  He carried with him a King's decree, a quest to find the legendary Sunstone, rumored to lie hidden within the treacherous Serpent's Peak.

The fate of countless lives rested on their ability to navigate the cosmic unknown.
