
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest was proving more perilous than any battlefield.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the path was choked with overgrown vegetation, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic, spurred him on, each creak of his saddle a testament to his unwavering resolve. He dreamt of glory, of wealth, but mostly of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the void after a catastrophic solar flare.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless attacks of space pirates were commonplace hazards, but the potential discovery of surviving colonists, the chance to piece together a lost chapter of human history, fueled her unwavering commitment.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space held immense danger, but the allure of the unknown was irresistible.
