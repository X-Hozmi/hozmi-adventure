
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a few dried apples and a chipped map, its directions barely legible.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Ys, whispered to hold secrets older than Christendom itself – a journey fraught with brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the plague that stalked the land. Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred her on, each creak of the saddle a reminder of the perilous but thrilling adventure unfolding.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising fertile lands and untold resources for a humanity desperately clinging to survival.  Navigation through the treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate vessels made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, but the promise of a new beginning, of forging a path for humanity among the stars, outweighed the risks. The vast, star-dusted canvas of space was her battlefield, her adventure, a voyage of discovery as profound as any medieval quest.
