
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, little more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery on the far side of the Black Mountains, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine were his constant companions on this perilous journey across a land steeped in both beauty and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The vast, inky expanse of space, punctuated by the breathtaking spectacle of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The mission's success – and the survival of her crew – hinged on precise calculations and unwavering courage in the face of the unknown.
