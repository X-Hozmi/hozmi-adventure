
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid from a distant monastery rumored to possess a cure for the creeping plague.  Each sunrise brought the peril of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the unwavering glint in Elara's eyes mirrored the indomitable spirit of her journey.  She was bound for salvation, or certain doom, and the road ahead was paved with uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Khan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive thrumming a steady song across the void.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space held both wonder and danger – rogue asteroids, hostile alien civilizations, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  But Nova, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, felt the familiar thrill of exploration ignite within her,  a yearning for the next horizon, the next unexplored world waiting to be discovered.
