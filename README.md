
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast, unforgiving Sahara.  Bandits, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies were less daunting than the whispers of djinn and forgotten magic that clung to the ancient trade routes she followed.  Each day brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous canyons to bartering with suspicious tribesmen, fueling her thirst for discovery and the hope of finding her missing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the hostile K'tharr colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers were child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting her.  The K'tharr were notoriously unpredictable, and the stakes were higher than ever – the fate of countless planets hung in the balance.  Her courage, honed by years of daring interstellar expeditions, would be tested to its limits.
