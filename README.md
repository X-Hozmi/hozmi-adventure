Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  His journey had already taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest, where he’d faced highwaymen, starvation, and the chilling gaze of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the bittersweet relief of another day survived in his relentless pursuit of Eldoria's promise.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.

The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of alien worlds and the hum of the ship's engines, tested her resolve, but the hope of finding the colonists, and perhaps discovering new life, propelled her ever onward into the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
