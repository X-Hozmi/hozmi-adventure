
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed hope, each fleeting encounter with a fellow traveler a potential lifeline in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The path ahead remained arduous, but the promise of reaching her sacred destination fuelled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril, not from bandits or disease, but from unpredictable spatial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Despite the technological marvels at her command, the vastness of space instilled a primal fear, a humbling reminder of humanity's insignificance against the backdrop of the cosmos. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting the unmapped territories of the stars.
