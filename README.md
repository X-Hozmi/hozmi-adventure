
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains giving way to shadowed forests.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the ever-present threat of disease, and the endless, grueling miles stretching before her to reach the fabled city of  Serinor.  Her quest – a legendary healing herb rumored to cure her ailing brother – demanded she brave the treacherous roads and untamed wilderness of a medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and gas painting the viewport in vibrant hues.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the challenges remained.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel were constants on her perilous journey to find a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
