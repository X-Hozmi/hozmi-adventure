
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, guided her towards the mythical Sunstone city, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in her quest;  the lure of adventure, the whisper of legend, propelled her forward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold resources and potentially, the answer to humanity's dwindling survival chances.  Asteroid fields, pirate incursions, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were commonplace dangers; but for Ryla, the vast expanse of the galaxy held a thrilling allure, a siren song promising discovery,  glory, and the chance to rewrite the future of her people.
