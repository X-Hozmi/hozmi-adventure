
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth clung to the air as he navigated the treacherous mountain pass, his destination the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a prickle of anticipation and fear.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a journey fueled by legend and the promise of untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, but the vast, unknowable expanse of space still held a sense of wonder and unease.  The hum of the hyperdrive and the distant whispers of cosmic radiation were the soundtrack to her interstellar voyage, a journey not for gold or glory, but for the future of humanity and the possibility of discovering life beyond Earth.
