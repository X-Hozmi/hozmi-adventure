The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, snaked before him, promising adventure – or death.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, held the potential for bandit ambush or fantastical beast.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and recover the lost Sunstone, was a perilous one, demanding courage, cunning, and the endurance to face whatever dark secrets the forest, and the world beyond, might reveal.
