
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored City of Gold, a fantastical place whispered about in taverns and around crackling campfires, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with every sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the whispered tales of untold riches a potent elixir against despair.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been a risky one, pushing the ship's ancient Alcubierre drive to its limits.  Her crew, a motley band of xeno-linguists, navigators, and engineers, were as worn as her ship, their faces etched with the strains of interstellar travel. The potential reward, however, outweighed the dangers – a lost civilization rumored to possess technology that could reshape the very fabric of space and time.  The vast, star-dusted expanse offered both wonder and terror, a testament to the boundless possibilities and inherent risks of galactic exploration.
