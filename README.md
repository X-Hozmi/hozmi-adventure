
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in a tavern tale.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – unfamiliar dialects, hostile lords, and the constant gnawing hunger in his belly.  But the lure of the exotic East, of silks and spices and untold riches, spurred him relentlessly towards his distant goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had already taken decades, a lifetime spent navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling cosmic storms, and repairing the ship's increasingly temperamental hyperdrive.  The promise of a new habitable world, whispered on the archaic comms system, fueled her crew's tireless efforts.  Yet, the vast emptiness of space pressed in, a constant reminder of their isolation and the monumental risks they faced in the search for a new home amongst the stars.
