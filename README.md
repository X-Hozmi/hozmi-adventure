
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate moor, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he’d left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and the faint hope of salvation.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but fuel was dwindling and the alien signals detected were…unpredictable.   Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and establish first contact.  Ahead lay the vast emptiness of interstellar space, teeming with both wonder and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien languages were all part of the day's work for a galactic explorer.
