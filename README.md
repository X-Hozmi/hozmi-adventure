
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains as Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas trailing behind, urged his weary steed onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, swirling sandstorms, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  But the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires, a beacon in the distance, fueled their relentless journey across a landscape both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant K'tharr Hegemony, traversing light-years and navigating asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and traders, faced not only the perils of space but the ever-present risk of political intrigue and the unknown dangers lurking beyond charted space. The vast expanse of the galaxy offered both unimaginable riches and terrifying unknowns.
