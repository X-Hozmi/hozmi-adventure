
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary steed as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at a bruised sky.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, offered little comfort against the howling wind and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a stark reminder of the perils faced by those who dared to traverse the unforgiving landscape on a quest for the legendary Sunstone.  Survival, let alone success, felt like a distant, shimmering dream.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her crew, a motley band of xeno-biologists and seasoned explorers, buzzed with nervous energy as they approached the uncharted planet Kepler-186f. The promise of discovering new life forms, however, was balanced by the very real threat of unknown dangers lurking within the planet's unexplored ecosystems, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  The vastness of space, once a source of wonder, felt suddenly claustrophobic as they prepared for a potentially deadly first contact.
