
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort compared to the unknown that lay ahead: the rumored lost city of Eldoria, nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the journey, a tapestry woven with the perils of brigands, treacherous passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  He carried with him only a worn map, a faith in his own resilience, and a burning desire for adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity, light years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of star-jumps and hyperspace navigations, punctuated by the hum of the engines and the crackle of comms.  The vast emptiness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, was a stark contrast to the cramped confines of her ship.  Yet, the potential for discovery, the possibility of encountering new life, fueled her unwavering determination, a thirst for the unknown mirroring that of Thomas, all those centuries ago.
