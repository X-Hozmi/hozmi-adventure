
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guides her towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets fuel her relentless journey, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' leaping across the vast chasm of interstellar space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with peril – unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of engine failure.  But Ryla, hardened by years of galactic exploration, navigates these dangers with steely determination, her crew a family bound by shared purpose.  The promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge propels them onward, into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
