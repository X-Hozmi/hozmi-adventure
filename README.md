
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  But the hope of salvation spurred her on, a tiny flame against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict mining station orbiting Kepler-186f.  The journey was a gamble; hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, and pirate vessels lurked in the shadows between star systems.  Yet, the galaxy beckoned with its glittering promise of discovery, and Ryla, fueled by her unwavering determination, pushed the limits of human (and technological) endurance, one warp jump at a time.
