
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her resilience, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's swirling colours.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning lightyears and untold dangers.  Cosmic storms threatened to shatter their shields, unknown alien species lurked in the inky black between stars, and the relentless pressure of interstellar travel tested both the ship and its crew to their limits.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of finding new worlds and forging new alliances, drove them across the vast expanse of space, a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.
