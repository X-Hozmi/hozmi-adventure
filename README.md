
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the burning hope for his sister’s recovery fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden gravitational anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vast expanse of the galaxy offered breathtaking beauty, but also held unimaginable dangers as they pushed the boundaries of known space, driven by the unwavering hope of finding survivors.
