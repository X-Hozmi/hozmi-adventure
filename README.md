
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across Europe was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours; it was a grueling test of endurance, fraught with perilous mountain passes, bandit ambushes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing hunger of the road, the sting of the elements, and the persistent hope of reaching her distant destination – a rumored monastery holding a cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding flawless coordination between his crew and the ship's aging but reliable hyperdrive.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril than the medieval world; the unknown, the possibility of encountering hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure, all loomed larger than any earthly bandit.
