
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting wind and the ever-present threat of bandits.  His quest: to reach the Holy City of Jerusalem, a journey fraught with peril, encompassing treacherous mountain passes, lawless territories teeming with brigands, and the ever-present danger of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another league conquered on his arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, far removed from the dangers of Reginald’s time, yet equally perilous in its own right.  The vastness of space held its own terrors - unpredictable solar flares, malfunctioning systems, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile life forms.  Her mission: to chart new worlds and expand humanity's reach across the galaxy.
