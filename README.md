
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, uncharted forest a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel holds not just supplies, but a king's ransom in the form of rare spices, a desperate gamble to save her family’s failing business.  Bandits, disease, and the unforgiving wilderness itself threaten her every step, but the whisper of distant markets and the promise of untold wealth fuel her onward, a tiny figure against the immense landscape. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a chapter in her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking but treacherous backdrop to her interstellar voyage.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to solving a galactic famine.  Warp drives hum, and the ship groans under the strain of traversing unimaginable distances.  Pirate attacks, navigational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions test both her skill and her courage.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space holds both wonder and deadly peril,  but the hope of saving countless lives drives her through the endless black.
