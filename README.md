
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispering winds carried tales of monstrous creatures guarding the desert’s hidden oases. Yet, with every creak of her saddle and each rise of the sun, Elara's determination grew, fuelled by a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than the desert sun.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Navigation across the galaxy was a delicate dance between wormhole jumps and astrogation, each leap a gamble against unforeseen celestial phenomena and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. The promise of a new colony on Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life unlike any known, spurred her onward. The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a boundless canvas for a captain driven by the relentless human desire for discovery.
