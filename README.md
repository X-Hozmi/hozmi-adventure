
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  The air shimmers with heat, and the distant mountains loom like ancient giants.  Each day brings its own trials – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and wonders, pushes us onward, a shared dream fueling our weary steps against the relentless backdrop of the medieval world.


Millennia later, the *Starseeker* hurtles through the inky blackness of space, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million glittering stars.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, an exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of solar flares, and the isolating vastness of the cosmos itself. Yet, the promise of discovering new life, new technologies, and uncharted territories spurs us on, a testament to humanity's enduring thirst for exploration across the galactic expanse.
