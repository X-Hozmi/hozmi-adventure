
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the muddy track barely discernible beneath the relentless downpour.  Each step was a challenge;  bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous bogs threatened to swallow whole carts, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at our resolve. Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, said to hold untold riches and magic, spurred us on, a shimmering mirage in the unforgiving landscape of the Middle East.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our guide.  Our hyperdrive hummed a lullaby of interstellar travel as we leaped between nebulae, the breathtaking tapestry of the cosmos a stark contrast to the muddy trails of our ancestors.  Each jump was a gamble, the possibility of encountering pirate fleets or encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies a constant reminder of the inherent danger in pushing the boundaries of known space. Still, the promise of a new world, a new civilization, a new beginning, beckoned us across the vast, unknowable expanse.
