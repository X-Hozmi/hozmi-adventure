
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheels and every whispered prayer to the saints, the allure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, spurs us onward.

Conversely, centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship capable of folding spacetime, hums quietly as it leaps between nebulae. Captain Elara, her eyes fixed on the swirling cosmic dust of the Andromeda galaxy, navigates through uncharted territory, seeking a lost colony rumored to possess knowledge of the ancient precursor civilizations. The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent beauty of celestial wonders, holds both exhilarating promise and terrifying unknowns, a daunting but thrilling journey into the heart of the galaxy.
