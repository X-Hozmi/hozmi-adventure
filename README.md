
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Ys, a place whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and deadly magic.  Her small band, a motley crew of knights, scholars, and a surprisingly nimble thief, pressed on, braving bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of potential discovery and the chilling possibility of demise.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Lost Colony of Kepler-186f, a settlement vanished centuries ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and deciphering cryptic alien signals kept her crew on the edge of their seats.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the brilliant spectacle of distant galaxies, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  The search for the lost colony was a race against time and an odyssey into the deepest mysteries of the cosmos.
