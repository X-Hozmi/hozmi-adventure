
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, a tapestry of rolling hills and dense forests.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the plague that stalked the land.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for his ailing brother, a journey fraught with peril, but one he would undertake regardless.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold brilliance of distant suns, offered a different kind of peril –  malfunctioning hyperdrives, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding a new home for humanity, spurred her onward through the black, star-dusted void.
