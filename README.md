
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to reach the legendary healer in the distant valley.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, but the promise of salvation spurred her onward, through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in a time of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all part of a day's work for Razor and his crew.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, held a certain allure, a promise of discovery and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration to the edge of known existence.
