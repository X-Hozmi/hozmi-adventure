The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost Amulet of Aethelred.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but minor inconveniences compared to the glory that awaited him at journey's end – or the certain death that lurked in the shadows of every crag and cavern.

Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls, her knuckles white, as the jump drive engaged, spitting them across lightyears to the Kepler-186f system.

Facing unimaginable distances, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present danger of navigational errors,  the crew knew this perilous journey offered a slim chance of survival, but the hope of finding their lost kin spurred them onward, a beacon in the vast emptiness of space.
