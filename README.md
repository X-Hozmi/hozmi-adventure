
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the rhythmic creak of the wheels a counterpoint to the hawk's cry overhead.  Her journey from the shadowed forests of Bavaria to the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the dark canyons,  rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the promise of a new life, of escape from a dwindling family estate, spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.  Her mission: to chart a course through unmapped star systems in search of a mythical, energy-rich planet whispered about in ancient galactic lore.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, Eva faced threats of cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien lifeforms.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of allure, a boundless expanse promising unimaginable discoveries.
