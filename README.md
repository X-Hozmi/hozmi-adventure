
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild animals, and the insidious plague itself.  The road was his only guide, a thread of hope weaving through a tapestry of uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were mere child's play compared to the unknown dangers awaiting them on the other side – alien predators, hostile environments, and the lingering mystery of the vanished colonists.  The galaxy itself was their road, a perilous yet alluring path to the unknown.
