
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel holds a worn map, a few meager coins, and the hope of reaching the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, fuels both fear and determination. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain are constant threats, but the whisper of Eldoria's healing waters keeps her pushing onward, her journey a desperate gamble against the odds.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver splinter against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold a new form of energy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is a daily routine, a far cry from the dusty trails of Elara's time.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the unknown dangers lurking in the cosmic expanse, mirrors the ancient adventurer's spirit. The vastness of space, instead of a barren landscape, offers its own unique challenges and breathtaking rewards.
