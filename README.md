
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whisper of legend, spurred him onwards, his determination fueled by hope and the burning desire for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, encounters with unknown alien species, and the constant hum of the ship's aging engines were her daily realities. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the promise of discovery far outweighed the risks, driving Eva and her crew toward the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
