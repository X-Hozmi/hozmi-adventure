
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies in the small caravan behind him.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara in the far-off mountains, had already claimed several companions to illness and banditry.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, ravenous wolves, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, a fear that fueled both their determination and their mounting despair.  The promised salvation felt as distant as the snow-capped peaks that loomed before them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, was also a terrifying expanse of nothingness.  Cosmic rays, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were constant companions.  The crew, a diverse band of scientists and explorers, clung to hope and the data streams promising signs of life on their distant target. The journey was perilous, but the possibility of discovering a new world made it worthwhile.
