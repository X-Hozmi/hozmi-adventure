
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger. But the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of uncovering lost knowledge, spurred her onward, a fierce wind in her sails despite the hardships.  She was not merely traveling; she was chasing a dream.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, said to harbor a planet teeming with life unlike anything humanity had ever encountered.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the threat of stellar radiation were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of discovery, the chance to expand human knowledge and perhaps, find a new home among the stars.
