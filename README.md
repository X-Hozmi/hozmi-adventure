
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, the scent of pine and woodsmoke clinging to the crisp autumn air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious map promising a hidden monastery rumored to possess ancient healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked beyond the next bend.  The journey was perilous, but the potential reward – the chance to save her ailing brother – fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of her starship.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf.  The jump to hyperspace had been exhilarating, but the real adventure lay in navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable space storms of the Xylos system.  The galaxy held untold wonders, and untold dangers, but Ryla, ever the intrepid explorer, pressed forward.
