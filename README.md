
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  His journey across the breadth of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a new challenge to overcome: negotiating with suspicious villagers, fording raging rivers, or simply finding enough sustenance to survive another day.  The allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, however, fuelled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work.  But the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the knowledge that her cargo could mean survival for a new generation of humans, made the inherent risks worthwhile. The ultimate adventure lay not just in reaching her destination, but in the infinite wonders of the galaxy itself.
