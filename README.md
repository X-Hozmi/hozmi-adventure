
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, a cacophony of sailors' shouts and the pungent aroma of salt and spices.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked its way across the rugged terrain of southern France, towards the Holy Land. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands, fueled our weary steps, a shared dream binding us together against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a starship built of shimmering alloys and fueled by the very fabric of spacetime, sliced through the inky blackness, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks and breathtaking vistas – nebulae painted across the cosmos like divine brushstrokes, the ethereal glow of distant galaxies, and the silent majesty of uncharted space.  Each warp jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of the universe, yet the promise of discovery burned brighter than any star.
