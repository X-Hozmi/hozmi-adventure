
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her toward the legendary City of Ys, said to lie hidden beneath the shifting sands.  Each creak of her saddle, each wary glance over her shoulder at the looming horizon, fueled the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were merely obstacles in her quest for a forgotten marvel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate corsairs, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all part of the cosmic gamble.  The vastness of space offered a stark and beautiful contrast to the cramped confines of his ship, a constant reminder of the immense scale of his adventure and the potential rewards – or catastrophic failures – that lay ahead.
