
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a tattered raven's wing.  Ahead lay the whispering forests of Eldoria, rumored to hold both forgotten magic and deadly beasts.  Her worn map, a patchwork of parchment and faded ink, offered little comfort against the vast unknown.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised either breathtaking discovery or a swift, brutal end.  She clutched the worn leather pouch at her hip – containing not gold, but a seed, a legacy she swore to plant in the fabled sun-drenched valley beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Jump drives hummed, preparing for the treacherous hyperspace leap to Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches – and unimaginable dangers.  The galactic cartography was far more precise than Elara’s ancient map, yet the risks remained: rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of unknown anomalies lurking in the void between stars. Ryla’s mission, to secure a rare element crucial for galactic stability, was a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
