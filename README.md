
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King's court. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the biting wind threatened to sweep her from the narrow trails, yet Elara pressed on, fueled by a fierce determination to reach her destination before winter's grip tightened its icy claws. Each creaking step of her weary steed echoed the pounding rhythm of her courageous heart.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable expanse.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, had taken years, a relentless dance between hyperspace jumps and the constant hum of the warp drive.  Cosmic rays bombarded the vessel, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields kept Jax and his crew on high alert, but the allure of discovering a new world, a new beginning, far outweighed the dangers of the interstellar void.
