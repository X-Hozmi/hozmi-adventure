
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scratching at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to forge an alliance with the remote highland clan.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack.  Survival, let alone success, demanded unwavering courage and cunning in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's ethereal glow.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers was child's play compared to the existential dread of interstellar loneliness.  The vast expanse of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both the promise of rediscovery and the chilling possibility of oblivion.
