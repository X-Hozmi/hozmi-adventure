
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the biting wind.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, and the constant gnawing hunger. But the whispered tales of the legendary City of Gold fueled her onward, a beacon against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged with fellow travelers, and the sheer stubbornness to overcome the odds – these were the ingredients of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a jewel in the far reaches of the Cygnus constellation.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with risk, pirate attacks were commonplace, and the alien landscapes of Kepler-186f held unknown terrors. Yet, the vast expanse of the cosmos, the camaraderie of her crew, and the tantalizing promise of scientific discovery surpassed any fear. The universe was her playground, and exploration her destiny.
