
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery nestled high in the Alps, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve at every turn, yet the glint of hope in her brother's eyes fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista of breathtaking beauty and daunting danger.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to the isolated colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate cruisers, and battling the insidious effects of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work. But the sight of the green, vibrant planet rising from the cosmic dust, a beacon of hope in the vast, star-strewn void, made every risk worthwhile. The galaxy was a dangerous place, but the rewards of exploration were equally immense.
