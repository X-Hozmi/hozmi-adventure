
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a chipped map, its faded ink hinting at the perilous journey ahead.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unyielding grip of disease, yet the whispered tales of the legendary city of Ys spurred her onward, a beacon in the daunting wilderness.  The thrill of the unknown, the promise of discovery, burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint whispers of nebulae and the pulsing rhythm of quasars, Rexa charted a course toward the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space held its own dangers: rogue asteroids, cosmic storms, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets, propelled her forward, a lone explorer braving the cosmic ocean.
