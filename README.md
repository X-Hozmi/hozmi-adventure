
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine. His quest: to retrieve the stolen Orb of Aethelred from the clutches of the treacherous Baron Maldor.  Each sunrise brings new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the Orb, whispered to possess unimaginable power, fuels his relentless journey across the ravaged landscape, a desperate race against time and the encroaching winter.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of cosmic travel as she navigates the treacherous nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled planet of Elysium, said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and deciphering ancient alien maps are just a few of the challenges she faces, each more perilous than the last. The vast, unknown expanse of space stretches before her, a thrilling and terrifying tapestry of adventure woven from starlight and risk.
