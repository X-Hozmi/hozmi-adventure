
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean still clinging to our clothes as we rode eastward.  Our caravan, a lumbering tapestry of pack animals and weary travelers, snaked across the sun-baked plains of Provence, then clawed its way through the treacherous Pyrenees mountains.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowy forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the Silk Road, the whispered promise of exotic spices and untold riches in the distant East, spurred us onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  We left behind the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way, charting a course through the unmapped nebulae towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Days bled into weeks of sublight travel punctuated by brief, breathtaking glimpses of celestial wonders – swirling nebulas painted across the inky blackness, and distant galaxies like glittering islands in a cosmic sea.  The mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a planet orbiting a binary star system – a perilous quest fraught with unknown dangers, both alien and technological.
