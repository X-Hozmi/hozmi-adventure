
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, had already seen her evade bandits in the shadow of crumbling castles, navigate treacherous mountain passes, and barter for meager sustenance in hushed, smoky taverns.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – the threat of disease, the uncertainty of the road, the ever-present fear of the unknown. Yet, the unwavering hope of reaching the papal court spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.  Her mission: to chart a course through unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage that would push the boundaries of human exploration.  Navigating asteroid fields, grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents, and dealing with the ever-present threat of rogue AI were merely routine hazards. The true challenge lay in the sheer isolation, the breathtaking immensity of space, and the weight of responsibility resting on her shoulders as she sought to unravel the cosmos' deepest mysteries.
