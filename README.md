
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains in fiery hues. Her journey across the kingdom was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from fording icy rivers to navigating through dense, whispering woodlands, but the hope of reaching her estranged brother spurred her onward.  The whispers of a magical artifact, rumored to cure his illness, fueled her desperate quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna, and guarded by hostile alien forces.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between days and weeks, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. But the promise of galactic peace, and the lives of billions depending on her success, spurred her on across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
