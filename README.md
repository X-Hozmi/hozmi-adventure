
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the already-dim setting sun. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Days blurred into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, fording treacherous rivers, and navigating by the stars under a vast, indifferent sky. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the tantalizing hope of reaching their destination – a hope that fueled their weary bodies and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate plea for aid crackling over the comms.  The journey was fraught with peril, from unpredictable wormholes that threatened to tear the ship apart to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of uncharted star systems.  But the possibility of rescuing thousands and uncovering the secrets of Xylos's enigmatic energy source spurred Eva and her crew to push on, their courage tempered by the cold, hard reality of interstellar travel.
