
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode, the midday sun beating down on his worn leather jerkin.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister. The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any brigand.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, a constant test of his endurance and resolve, fueled only by his desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Asteroids, rogue gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made the interstellar voyage a constant gamble.  But Eva, hardened by years of exploration, felt the thrill of the unknown pulse through her veins, a far cry from the mundane routines of Earth, and the potential rewards outweighed the risks a thousandfold.
