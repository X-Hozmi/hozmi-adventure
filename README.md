The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scroll of King Arthur.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but small obstacles in his pursuit of glory and the knowledge the scroll promised. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the adrenaline coursing through him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

Yet, the allure of discovery, of finding life beyond Earth, pushed her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the infinite canvas of space.
