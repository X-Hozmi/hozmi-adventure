
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her skin.  The King's decree, a cryptic scroll promising untold riches in the far East, burned a hole in her saddlebag, a constant reminder of the dangers ahead.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and whispers of monstrous beasts guarding forgotten mountain passes fueled the nights.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the chance to escape the stifling confines of her village, outweighed any fear. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new step closer to her unknown destiny.

Alternatively, centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, a decades-long expedition charting unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, was far removed from the dusty roads of old.  Instead of bandits, she faced the chilling void of space, the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  But the glittering tapestry of stars, the promise of discovering new life, and the intoxicating freedom of interstellar travel, propelled her ever onwards, a modern-day adventurer seeking her fortune amongst the cosmos.
