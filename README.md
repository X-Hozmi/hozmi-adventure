
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, the lure of the unknown, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  He rode towards the horizon, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent backdrop of history.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity facing resource depletion.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent majesty of nebulae and the terrifying power of stellar flares, was a constant companion.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the chance of encountering alien life, both benevolent and hostile.  Eva navigated treacherous asteroid fields and cosmic anomalies, driven by the same unwavering courage that propelled medieval knights – the thirst for discovery and the yearning for a better future.
