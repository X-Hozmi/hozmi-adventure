
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary mule across the sun-baked plains.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, has tested her spirit and her strength. Bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the desert have all been faced with unwavering resolve.  Each sunrise brings a renewed determination to reach the oasis, a beacon of hope against the vast, unforgiving expanse.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starbreaker" Valerius pilots his starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Facing down cosmic storms, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and outmaneuvering relentless pirate fleets, Rexx relies on his crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, presents perils far greater than any earthly landscape, demanding courage, quick thinking, and an unwavering commitment to the mission.
