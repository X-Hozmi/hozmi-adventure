
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Rhône Valley, a ribbon of green winding through the harsh, unforgiving landscape.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the grim reminder of how far she still had to travel.  But the hope for her brother's life fueled her onward, pushing her further than she ever thought possible.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a lonely path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was a daily occurrence.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of other galaxies, could be both awe-inspiring and terrifyingly isolating. Yet, the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, spurred her crew onward, facing unknown dangers with courage and unwavering determination.
