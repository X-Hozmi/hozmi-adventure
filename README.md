
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were a constant companion, but the promise of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary sunrise, was a step closer to the unknown, a testament to the courage it took to challenge the vast and treacherous landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigation was a delicate dance of astrogation and sheer willpower, charting a course through nebulae and dodging asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize her vessel. The thrill wasn't just the journey itself, but the discovery – the potential to find new worlds teeming with life, or perhaps, the remnants of civilizations lost to time, echoing in the silent expanse of space.
