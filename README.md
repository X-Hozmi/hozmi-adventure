
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing his ailing sister – was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, wolves howled in the night, and the endless expanse of wilderness tested the limits of both man and beast.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden spacetime anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the grasping tendrils of gravitational anomalies was a daily routine.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the hum of her ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The fate of an entire colony rested on her shoulders, a burden as heavy as any knight's quest.
