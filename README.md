
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees as Elara, her cloak pulled tight against the chill, urged her weary mule onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with silks and spices, was strapped securely behind.  Bandits roamed the passes, and whispers of a monstrous beast guarding a hidden valley fueled her fear, but the promise of riches in distant Avignon spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh surge of adrenaline, a testament to the constant peril and thrilling uncertainty of medieval overland travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Starfall" Valerius piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been brutal, the ship shuddering under the strain of hyperspace.  Ahead lay the fabled Kryll system, rumored to hold a cache of Xylanium, the most powerful energy source known to humankind.  But the Kryll were a notoriously aggressive species, and pirates lurked in the shadowed sectors between stars.  The challenge wasn't just navigating treacherous cosmic currents; it was facing the unknown and unpredictable dangers of intergalactic exploration.
