
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, spurred his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, rumored haunt of brigands and worse.  His quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a relic of immense power, before it fell into the wrong hands.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, whispered of unseen dangers, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where the greatest adventures often lurked just beyond the next bend in the dusty road.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, presented challenges unlike any faced by medieval travelers, but the promise of discovery, of charting unknown worlds, fueled her relentless journey across the cosmos.
