
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered in hushed tones across campfires, fueled their weary bodies and resolute spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in standard time, though compressed through the ship's advanced Alcubierre drive.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel presented far less physical danger than the psychological strain of prolonged isolation.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the ethereal beauty of distant galaxies, held a thrilling yet lonely grandeur, a stark contrast to the grounded hardships of the medieval traveler.
