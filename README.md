
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Thomas's boots as he crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked plains stretching before him like a crumpled map.  His pack, heavy with meager supplies and the weight of his hopes, felt lighter than the burden of the King's decree: find the lost monastery rumored to hold the cure for the plague.  Each creak of his saddle, each whinny from his weary steed, punctuated the perilous journey ahead, a tapestry woven with the threads of unknown dangers – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His only companions were the relentless sun and the whispered prayers he offered to saints long forgotten.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula outside the viewport painted a breathtaking, yet terrifying, canvas.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, an ocean of stars stretching to infinity, held both wonder and peril.  Asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirates were just some of the obstacles that stood between her and the galaxy's greatest secret.  Her crew, a motley collection of seasoned explorers, were her only solace in the cold, unforgiving expanse.
