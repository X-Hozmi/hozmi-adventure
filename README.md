
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and the distant clang of blacksmiths’ hammers from some forgotten village.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creaking joint of his aging horse, each aching muscle in his own body, was a testament to the brutal beauty of his journey across a land both majestic and treacherous.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted across her viewport were a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, a settlement swallowed by the void decades ago.  While the challenges weren't of mud and muscle, but of plasma storms and gravitational anomalies, the thrill of exploration and the weight of responsibility echoed through the millennia, connecting her journey to that of Sir Reginald, a fellow adventurer striving against the odds.
