
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the scent of pine sharp against the chill wind.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the valley below – a sanctuary rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the journey, a testament to the risks and rewards of medieval travel, where each sunrise brought a new challenge and the promise of untold adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space offered a thrilling freedom, but also a stark and unforgiving reality.  Each jump was a gamble, each planet a potential treasure trove or a deadly trap.  The adventure was cosmic, the stakes unimaginable.
