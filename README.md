
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a few precious silver coins, and a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope of finding salvation fueled her journey, transforming each hardship into a step closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship 'Stardust' through the nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking yet treacherous backdrop to her intergalactic voyage.  Her mission: to locate a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on her drought-stricken home planet.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, she relied on her advanced technology and sharp instincts to conquer the vast emptiness of space.  The universe held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying danger, but the potential to save her people spurred her onward across the uncharted expanse.
