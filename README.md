
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I rode eastward, a biting wind whipping at my cloak.  The map, painstakingly copied from a crumbling scroll, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains – a lost city of gold, they said.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the wilderness head-on, kept my spirits high, even as frostbitten fingers tightened around the reins of my weary horse.

Centuries hence, the stars are my guide.  My vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive humming a song of distant nebulae.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap, is measured not in days but in light-years.  Each jump is a gamble, a test of the ship's integrity against the unforgiving vastness of space.  Alien encounters are commonplace, some friendly, others less so, adding a constant element of unpredictability to this grand, cosmic odyssey.
