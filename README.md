
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes onward, the relentless sun beating down on her and her mule laden with meager supplies.  Her journey across the unforgiving plains of Aragon is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, wild animals prowl the scrubland, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air. Yet, the whispers of a legendary lost city, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fuels her onward, each step a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne navigates her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Vast distances are conquered not by horse and foot, but by warp drives and meticulously charted hyperspace routes.  The dangers are different, but no less real: rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failures could mean the difference between galactic exploration and a cold, silent drift through the void.  Yet, the lure of new worlds, untapped resources, and the thrill of discovery propels her forward, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
