
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome was proving far more arduous than the tales of pilgrims had suggested. Bandit raids were a constant threat, the roads treacherous, and the nights filled with the howls of wolves. Yet, the burning ambition to seek absolution for his past sins, and the whispered promise of miracles at the Holy City, fueled his relentless pace across the war-torn landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations. Though faster-than-light travel lessened the time commitment for her crew, the vastness of space remained an intimidating constant.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien civilizations were dangers far removed from Thomas' medieval woes, yet equally perilous in their own right.  The quest for knowledge, however, was a universal human drive, binding these travelers across epochs.
