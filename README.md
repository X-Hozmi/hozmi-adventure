
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armour gleaming dully under a bruised sky, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked trails, treacherous mountain passes, and skirmishes with bandits lurking in shadowed forests.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the unwavering hope that Eldoria, and salvation, lay just beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a vital energy source capable of powering Earth’s failing sun.  Navigation was treacherous,  requiring precise calculations and constant vigilance against the unpredictable gravitational forces of black holes and rogue asteroids. The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of peril, a lonely battle against the unknown, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the comforting glow of the constellations.
