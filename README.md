
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sluggish serpent of pack mules and weary men, crawled across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, each sunset the chilling bite of desert winds.  We braved treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and bartered with suspicious nomads for meager supplies.  The lure of silks, spices, and untold riches spurred us onward, despite the ever-present danger and the gnawing uncertainty of our journey's end.  The very air vibrated with the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highways.  The *Starseeker*, a vessel of shimmering chrome and impossible angles, leaped across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the deafening silence of space.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  We navigated asteroid fields the size of planets, evaded the gravity wells of rogue stars, and faced the chilling reality of alien encounters, both beautiful and terrifying. The cosmos, vast and indifferent, offered a different kind of peril – a lonely, awe-inspiring adventure far beyond anything the medieval traveler could have imagined.
