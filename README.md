
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits and disease hanging heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – a crumbling bridge to repair, a hostile khanate to appease, or perhaps the breathtaking sight of a hidden oasis, a momentary respite from the harsh realities of the journey.  Our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, feels as distant and mythical as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship, carries us across the vast gulf between galaxies, its artificial sun a pale imitation of the ones we left behind.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the possibility of encountering unforeseen celestial phenomena or hostile alien civilizations.  The crew, born under the artificial light of the Althea, dream of new worlds, of vibrant alien ecosystems, and the thrill of charting unmapped constellations.  But the true adventure lies not just in reaching our destination, but in the journey itself, the forging of bonds amidst the isolation and the shared pursuit of a future yet unwritten.
