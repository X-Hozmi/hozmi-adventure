
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the ongoing plague.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city, and the hope it represented, spurred them relentlessly across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of hyperspace anomalies, pirate attacks from the dreaded Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any help.  Yet, the thought of those reliant on her cargo, the hope for survival burning in their hearts, fueled her across the impossibly vast emptiness of space.
