
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their battered cart, laden with meager supplies and a king's ransom in promised trade goods, groaned under the weight of their journey.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the perils they faced as they traversed the vast, unknown lands between the Kingdom of Aeridor and the fabled spice markets of the East.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, the thrill of discovery, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship cutting through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet swallowed by a nebula decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate factions, and deciphering ancient alien star charts were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space held untold wonders, and dangers just as immense, for this intrepid explorer pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and courage.
