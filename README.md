
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of St. Elara, had tested them beyond measure. Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the endless expanse of unforgiving terrain had thinned their supplies and frayed their nerves. Yet, the whispers of miracles and the unwavering faith fueling their quest spurred them onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of reaching their holy destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane oceans of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her home world.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace jumps was all in a day's work.  But the alien flora and fauna of Kepler-186f, as well as the potential for first contact with sentient life, made this particular mission both exhilarating and fraught with the unknown.
