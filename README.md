
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the relentless sun, but the glint of the sapphire hidden within its lining fueled her onward.  She was bound for Avignon, carrying a message of vital importance, a secret that could change the course of a war, her journey a treacherous tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present fear of the plague that stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a distant galaxy, a journey that would take years, spanning light-years and countless celestial bodies.  The vastness of space, the constant threat of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational pulls, were merely logistical hurdles compared to the political minefield she navigated among competing interstellar factions.  The fate of her crew, and perhaps the galaxy itself, rested on the successful completion of this perilous interstellar voyage.
