
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his plague-stricken village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the open road were constant companions, yet the hope of salvation spurred him on, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and survival.  He knew the journey would test his strength and courage, but the fate of his people rested upon his shoulders.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable cosmic weather were commonplace hazards.  Yet, the allure of discovery and the promise of unlocking new worlds pushed Eva and her crew further into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy, each jump through hyperspace a thrilling leap into the unknown.
