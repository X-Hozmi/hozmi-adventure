
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, demanded resilience beyond measure.  The landscape, a brutal tapestry of jagged peaks and unforgiving valleys, tested her spirit as much as her physical endurance, each sunrise bringing a new peril, each sunset a fragile hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unexplored systems was child's play compared to the political machinations back on Earth.  But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, trusted her crew and her gut, knowing the galaxy held both wonders beyond imagining and dangers that could swallow a ship whole.
