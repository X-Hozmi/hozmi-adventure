
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the Ardennes forest, was treacherous, choked with mud and fallen branches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised either a bandit ambush or a wild beast.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the lost Book of Kells, a journey fraught with peril but spurred by a desperate hope for salvation.  The scent of woodsmoke and the distant calls of wolves were a constant reminder of the raw, untamed beauty and danger that defined this era's travel.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances between galaxies remained a daunting challenge.  Weeks bled into months as they charted a course through unmapped regions, relying on ancient star charts and cutting-edge technology.  The risk of encountering rogue asteroids or unknown space anomalies was ever-present; a single miscalculation could mean oblivion.  Yet, the lure of a potential new habitable world, Xylos IV, fueled their relentless journey across the endless expanse of space.
