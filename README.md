
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Robbers lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, yet the hope of healing spurred her onward through the harsh beauty of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years away, had been flawlessly executed, but the true adventure lay in the unknown.  Uncharted landscapes, alien flora and fauna, and the potential for discovery thrilled her more than any terrestrial journey ever could. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of untold wonders and unimaginable dangers.
