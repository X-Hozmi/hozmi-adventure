
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the gnawing hunger of the open road, and the breathtaking beauty of untamed landscapes. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers and the unwavering hope that his perilous journey would ultimately bear fruit.  He carried with him not just supplies, but the weight of his family's fate.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant.  The journey across the galaxy had been arduous, punctuated by warp-core malfunctions and close encounters with space pirates. Now, the eerie silence of the derelict station promised its own set of challenges – perhaps something far more dangerous than any spacefaring criminal.  The fate of countless colonies depended on her success, and the weight of that responsibility pushed her to press onward into the unknown.
