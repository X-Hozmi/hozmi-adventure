
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the mythical city, and the hope it offered, propelled him relentlessly across the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was fraught with its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But unlike Reginald, Eva possessed technology capable of traversing unimaginable distances, battling cosmic hazards with advanced weaponry and shielding, her ultimate goal fueled by the hope of securing a future for humanity among the stars.
