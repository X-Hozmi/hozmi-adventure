
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind the creaking wheels of my cart as I traverse the rutted track, a lone figure against the vastness of the European plains.  My destination: the fabled city of Constantinople, a shimmering jewel whispered about in taverns and sung of in ballads.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the chance to witness wonders beyond my wildest imaginings, fuels my weary legs and keeps my spirit alight.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we leap across the void between galaxies.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable world light-years from Earth.  While the dangers are different – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life – the thrill remains the same.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae swirling around us, and the prospect of discovering new worlds and civilizations outweighs any risk, making this interstellar voyage a pilgrimage unlike any other.
