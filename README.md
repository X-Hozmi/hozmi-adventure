
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Thomas's saddlebags as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled his steps, the promise of spiritual solace and the tales he would bring back to his village outweighing the hardship.  Each town offered a new language, a new custom, a new adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own dangers: unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  But the lure of discovery, of mapping the uncharted territories of the cosmos, was an irresistible siren song, propelling her and her crew deeper into the inky black, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking and potentially perilous unknown.
