
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn leather boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Fiacre, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous swamps threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the glint of the distant monastery, his destination, spurred him onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm only slightly faster than the ship's hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and deciphering ancient alien maps pushed her skills to the limit.  But the promise of finding her ancestors, lost generations ago, fueled her determination amidst the breathtaking, and terrifying, immensity of space.
