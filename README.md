
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary mare across the sun-baked plains of Francia.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present hunger. Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  The journey is arduous, a test of endurance and resilience, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving rivers, a testament to the unwavering human spirit in a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is a constant companion, a comforting vibration against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate fleets, Ryla’s journey transcends mere physical distance; it's a voyage into the unknown, a push against the boundaries of human understanding and a relentless pursuit of the impossible, echoing the adventurous spirit of travelers throughout time.
