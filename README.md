
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys,  rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and whispers of monstrous creatures echoing through the ancient forests fueled her growing unease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria's rumored lost technologies and the whispered promise of untold riches spurred her onward, each hardship forging her into a tougher, more resilient soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a lonely one, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the occasional crackle of subspace comms.  But the vast emptiness held its own beauty, a humbling testament to the scale of the universe and the audacity of humankind's reach across its boundless expanse.
