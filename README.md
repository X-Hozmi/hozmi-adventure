
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease formed a gauntlet he must overcome. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, and a renewed sense of hope fueled by the whispers of Zerzura's magic.  He traveled with only a worn map, a loyal hound, and the courage forged in a lifetime of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the Xylos nebula.  The journey was measured in lightyears, a tapestry woven with cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling silence of interstellar space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Yet, the potential reward—the rescue of her fellow humans—spurred her onward, across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
