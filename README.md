
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged onward, the biting wind whipping across the barren plains of France.  Each step was a battle against mud, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Their quest, a mythical lost city rumored to hold unimaginable riches, pushed them further into the unforgiving wilderness.  The sun dipped low, casting long shadows that danced with the fear in their hearts – a fear both of the unknown and the very real dangers lurking just beyond the flickering firelight.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness between worlds.  The cosmos, vast and beautiful, held both wonder and peril in equal measure.
