The sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of sun-baked earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria rumored to hold the lost crown of Aethelred, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and past villages where suspicion warred with cautious hospitality.  Each day brought new challenges, from bandits lurking in shadowed glens to the ever-present threat of starvation and disease, yet the lure of Eldoria and the glory it promised kept his spirit alight.

Her mission, to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, was fraught with peril.

The vastness of the cosmos pressed in on her, a humbling reminder of humanity's fragile position amongst the stars, but the knowledge that her success could save countless lives fueled her journey across the light-years.
