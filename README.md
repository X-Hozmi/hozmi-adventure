
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her horse onward.  The journey across the kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  But the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins of Ys, spurred her on, each hardship a stepping stone towards the untold riches and perhaps, even magic, that awaited.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes still demanded caution and skill.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, before a rival corporation could claim it.  The journey, while technologically advanced, was no less perilous than Elara's, the vast emptiness of space teeming with its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates.
