
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a chipped flintlock pistol, a well-thumbed map promising riches in the distant kingdom of Eldoria, and a heart full of both hope and trepidation.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, but the lure of adventure, whispered on the wind, spurred her onward. Each sunrise painted a new vista, a thrilling reminder of the uncharted lands still waiting to be explored.


Centuries hence, Captain Lyra 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours painting her bridge in ethereal hues.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting constant, a stark contrast to the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of space.  Asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a gamble, but the allure of discovery, of finding a new home amongst the stars, made it a risk worth taking.  For Lyra, the journey wasn't just about reaching Kepler-186f; it was about charting a course for humanity's future among the galaxies.
