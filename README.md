
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains had been brutal, a tapestry woven with freezing nights, treacherous passes, and skirmishes with bandits.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – starvation, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of rival knights. Yet, the allure of the mythical Sunstone, said to grant unimaginable power, propelled him forward,  ignoring the gnawing fear that this perilous adventure might be his last.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet the vastness of space still held an unnerving grandeur.  Her mission: to recover a lost artifact from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made the journey a constant test of skill and courage, a high-stakes gamble for the future of humanity itself.
