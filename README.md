His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the King's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or exposure.

Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in, a constant reminder of the fragility of life among the stars.  But the allure of discovery, and the possibility of reshaping interstellar travel, fueled her unwavering spirit, her hand never leaving the controls.
