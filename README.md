
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a mix of excitement and trepidation.  Bandits lurked, supplies were scarce, and the whispers of mythical beasts added a chilling dimension to his journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage born of faith and fueled by the thrill of the unknown.  He carried not only his sword, but the hopes and dreams of his family, a burden as heavy as his armour.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a hypnotic counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic vistas outside her viewport.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Reginald’s journey, Eva faced a different kind of peril – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the threat of rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien life.  Her journey, however, was driven by the same potent mix of ambition and courage that propelled medieval adventurers: the unyielding desire to explore the vast unknown.
