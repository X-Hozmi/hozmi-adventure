
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her exposed skin.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient oaks, and the unpredictable weather threatened to bury her under a sudden avalanche.  Each day was a gamble, a harrowing test of endurance against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers.  Success meant the survival of a kingdom, failure, oblivion.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the starlight a kaleidoscope on the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril: asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories among the stars, fuelled their tireless pursuit across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
