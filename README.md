
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag, mirroring the grit clinging to her chapped lips.  Ahead, the sun beat down on the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-bleached fields and the occasional brooding chateau.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken for a lost brother, was fraught with peril – bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each day brought a new challenge, testing her resilience and forging her spirit in the crucible of the medieval world.  Yet, the promise of reunion fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with unpredictable wormhole currents and the ever-present threat of space pirates.   Navigating the vastness of space demanded unwavering focus and technological prowess, but the potential reward – the discovery of a new civilization – made every risk worthwhile. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched endlessly before her.
