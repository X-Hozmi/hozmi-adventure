
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden passes of the Pyrenees was far from over, the whispers of a mythical city, lost to time and legend, driving her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of the medieval world and the desperate gamble she had undertaken.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, punched through the nebula, its navigation systems guiding them through the chaotic beauty of uncharted space.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of the cosmos dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, but the challenges were no less daunting.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms tested their courage and ingenuity as they ventured into the unfathomable expanse between galaxies.
