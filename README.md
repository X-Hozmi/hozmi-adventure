
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his endurance, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset a grim reminder of the vastness of his undertaking.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at faster-than-light speeds.  The challenges were different now—navigating asteroid fields, avoiding hostile alien patrols, and managing the delicate balance of life support systems across the vast gulf of space. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the yearning to discover the unknown, burned just as brightly in her heart as it had in Sir Reginald’s.
