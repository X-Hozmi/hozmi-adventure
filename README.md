
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the unforgiving sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the ravaged plains of Aquitaine was far from over; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new chance to glimpse the fabled city of Ys, said to hold secrets lost to time.  The wind whispered tales of both peril and wonder, urging her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and light years from Earth.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  Navigation was a constant dance with gravitational anomalies and unpredictable wormholes, a far cry from the simple maps of Elara's time.  Yet, the unknown beckoned with a similar allure, a promise of discovery and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration – a timeless adventure in a new age.
