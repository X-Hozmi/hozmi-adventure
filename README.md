
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of miraculous healings at the shrine spurred them on, their shared purpose a flickering flame against the vast, uncertain landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with peril; unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids tested the crew's skills and courage to the limit. But the promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a world untouched by human conflict, fueled their tireless exploration, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the boundless unknown.
