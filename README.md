
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the distant city of Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered rumors of a miraculous relic and the desperate hope of finding a cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a sleeping village, each fleeting glimpse of a distant castle, marked another stage in his perilous journey across a landscape both beautiful and brutal – a land of bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and unforgiving rivers.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the predatory space pirates of the Crimson Syndicate, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer. The vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos was a constant companion, a breathtaking backdrop to the ever-present danger of her intergalactic quest.
