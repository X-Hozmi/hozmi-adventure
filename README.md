
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the Sunstone, and the hope it offered, fueled their weary steps across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula shimmering with amethyst and emerald hues. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy in search of habitable planets for a desperately overcrowded Earth.  Warp drives hummed, navigating the treacherous currents of space, dodging asteroid fields and the occasional rogue solar flare.  The vastness of the cosmos both terrified and exhilarated her; each new planet a potential new home, each unexplored system a thrilling, and potentially perilous, adventure.
