
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to healing her plague-stricken village.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the promise of salvation, fuels her relentless journey eastward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp drives hum, gravity shifts unpredictably, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks keeps her crew on high alert. The vastness of space is a lonely place, but the knowledge that her cargo might mean survival for thousands keeps Ryla's spirit, and her ship, forging ever onward.
