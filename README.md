
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, Elara pressed onward, driven by hope and the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Jackson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the volatile K'tharr system.  The journey, measured not in miles but light-years, was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the galaxy, vast and unforgiving as it was, held a certain allure for Jax, a promise of discovery and a chance to etch his name into the annals of spacefaring legend.
