
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon’s Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between him and the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or monstrous encounter.  His journey was fraught with peril, a constant test of endurance and courage against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, showing the perilous course through asteroid fields and unknown gravitational anomalies.  Unlike Reginald’s struggle with bandits, Eva's foes were cosmic – radiation storms, rogue planetoids, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space. Her journey, while technologically advanced, held a similar raw excitement and life-threatening uncertainty.
