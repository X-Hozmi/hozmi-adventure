
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the biting wind a constant companion on her arduous journey east.  Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless miles, promises riches in the fabled city of Samarkand, but the reality is a tapestry of sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain trails, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brings the hope of reaching her destination, but the journey itself, fraught with peril and unexpected encounters, is the true adventure.  She carries not only her meager possessions, but also the weight of her family's hopes and dreams.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's mastery of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a vast expanse teeming with uncharted planets and the potential for discovery beyond imagination.  Navigating nebulae, dodging asteroid fields, and facing the unknown terrors of deep space are all part of a daily routine.  The thrill of exploration fuels her, a legacy of those brave pioneers who first dared to reach for the stars, even as the loneliness of the cosmos occasionally weighs heavily upon her spirit.
