
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – the fear of bandits, of starvation, of the unknown lands that lay beyond the familiar borders of his homeland. His quest: to find a legendary healer rumored to reside in the remote monastery nestled high in the treacherous peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new source of vital energy crystals. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of terror.  The threat wasn't bandits or wild animals, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, the ever-present risk of pirate attacks, and the chilling unknown of alien life forms lurking in unexplored sectors of the galaxy.  Her adventure was one of cosmic proportions.
