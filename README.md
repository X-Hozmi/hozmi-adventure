
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, a legendary barrier between his homeland and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of unimaginable riches and ancient magic fueled his journey, a perilous trek through bandit-infested forests, across unforgiving deserts, and finally, a daring climb through treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, from sudden storms to the ever-present threat of wild animals and desperate men.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer*, a sleek starship cutting a path through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were all part of the routine. The potential discovery of a new life-sustaining planet, however, outweighed every risk.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the profound solitude and staggering scale of her adventure.
