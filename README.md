
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the sun-baked track.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new hope – and a gnawing fear of what lay beyond the next horizon.  The whispered tales of dragons and mythical beasts, once dismissed as children's stories, now echoed in her weary heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of distant suns was a constant dance with death, a far cry from the meticulously charted routes of Earth's solar system.  But the vastness of space, while terrifying, held a strange beauty, a promise of discovery that surpassed even the wildest medieval fantasies.  The unknown beckoned, and Eva, with a steely gaze, answered its call.
