
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were the constant companions on this perilous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, balanced by the gnawing fear of what the next nightfall might bring.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the hyperdrive, and the ever-present risk of encountering rogue asteroids or hostile alien vessels made each jump a gamble.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery on a new world, fueled her determination to complete her mission, a journey far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval adventurers.
