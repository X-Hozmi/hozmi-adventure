
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the constant, wearying trudge across rolling hills and unforgiving mountains.  He dreamt of Jerusalem, of salvation, but the reality was the relentless rhythm of his boots on earth, the shared hardship of his fellow pilgrims, and the ever-present shadow of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been smoother than expected, but the navigation through the asteroid field that guarded the planet's habitable zone was a nail-biter.  Her crew, a motley bunch of xeno-linguists and terraformers, were tense but excited; the discovery of a potential new home for humanity was worth the risks of interstellar travel, even if it meant facing the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile lifeforms.
