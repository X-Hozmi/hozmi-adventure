
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his mule westward.  He carries a battered map, its edges frayed, promising riches and adventure in the fabled city of Eldoria.  Each creaking wheel of his cart is a testament to the miles already traversed, a silent chronicle of skirmishes with bandits, nights spent huddled beneath the stars, and the ever-present fear of the unknown wilderness.  The journey is arduous, fraught with peril, but the lure of Eldoria's legendary treasures fuels his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stares out from the bridge of the starship *Starseeker*.  Beyond the viewport, a nebula shimmers, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars. Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable distances and potential dangers, dwarfs even Thomas's medieval trek.  Yet, the same adventurous spirit, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, binds them across the chasm of time.
