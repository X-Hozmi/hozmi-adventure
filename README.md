In the medieval era, adventure truly began the moment one stepped beyond the familiar gates of their village or town. The known world quickly gave way to uncharted territories, where every journey, whether for trade, pilgrimage, or the simple thrill of discovery, became an epic undertaken on foot or horseback. Roads were often mere tracks, winding through dense forests rumored to house mythical beasts, over treacherous mountain passes where blizzards could strike without warning, and across vast plains stalked by outlaws and rival lords. Each step was a gamble, a test of courage against the elements and the unknown perils lurking just beyond the horizon.

Yet, despite the formidable challenges, the allure of the open road was irresistible. Adventurers encountered strange new cultures in bustling market towns, marvelled at ancient ruins whispered to be touched by magic, and witnessed breathtaking landscapes never before seen by their own eyes. Nights were spent under a canopy of unfamiliar stars, listening to the crackle of a campfire, and sharing tales with fellow travelers. Returning home, if one was so fortunate, meant carrying not just precious goods or fulfilled vows, but a wealth of stories, a broadened perspective, and the indelible mark of a world far grander and more perilous than they had ever imagined.
