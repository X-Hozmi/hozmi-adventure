
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a road, swallowed the horse's hooves, the relentless grey sky mirroring the weariness in his heart. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the fading hope of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a diplomatic envoy to the Kryll Hegemony, a race of sentient crystalline beings inhabiting a planet orbiting a binary sun.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the infamous Serpent's Claw syndicate, and deciphering the complex Kryll language were mere trifles compared to the existential dread of interstellar travel, a constant gamble against the unforgiving vacuum of space and the ever-present possibility of encountering the unknown.
