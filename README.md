
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked frame, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had transformed the once-bright colours of his banner into faded mud.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through dense forests haunted by whispers of bandits and wilder beasts. Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another league closer to his destination – the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  He spurred his weary steed onwards, the clang of his armour a lonely counterpoint to the rustling leaves and the distant calls of unseen creatures.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, though vastly different from Reginald’s, held the same thrill of the unknown.  Instead of bandits, she navigated asteroid fields; instead of forests, she charted unmapped star systems.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of nebulas and distant galaxies, both awed and intimidated her.  Yet, the promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a new civilization, propelled her forward, a beacon burning brighter than any earthly star.  The cosmos was her canvas, and the 'Stardust Drifter', her brush.
