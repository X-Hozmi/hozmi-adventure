
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, a cacophony of smells and sounds that faded as we rode east, the rhythmic clop of horses' hooves a constant companion.  Days bled into weeks, the landscape shifting from sun-drenched vineyards to harsh, windswept plains. We faced bandits in shadowed forests, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and slept under a canopy of stars, far from the comforts of civilization. Every sunrise brought new challenges and the thrill of the unknown, the promise of adventure beckoning us ever onward towards the Silk Road and the mysteries of the Orient.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship forged from shimmering alloys, cut through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth, shrouded in the secrets of an alien biosphere.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, dodging the relentless pursuit of K'tharr pirates, our crew pushed the boundaries of human ingenuity and courage.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the breathtaking unknown, a gamble against the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.
