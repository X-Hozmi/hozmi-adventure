
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onwards.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort amidst the vast unknown.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles strewn across his path, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a small victory.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a search for legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate plea for help their only signal.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting hostile alien patrols, and the constant pressure of dwindling supplies were challenges as daunting as any medieval knight faced.  But unlike Thomas, Eva had the technology of a future age at her command – warp drives, advanced sensors, and a crew of highly trained specialists. Yet, the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of the cosmos, held terrors just as profound and unknown.
