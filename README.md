
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, guided his destrier across the muddy track.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve a sacred relic, pushed them onward.  The rough terrain tested their strength, their supplies dwindled, and the constant fear of the unknown gnawed at their resolve, yet the lure of adventure and the promise of glory fueled their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and constantly monitoring the ship's life support were all part of a typical voyage.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic wonders, was both inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump to hyperspace held the risk of encountering unforeseen anomalies or hostile alien life, but the promise of discovery and the exploration of uncharted worlds kept the crew of the Stardust Drifter pressing forward, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
