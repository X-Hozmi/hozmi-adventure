
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her frostbitten hand.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city before winter's grip fully claims the land.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger are constant companions, testing her resilience as much as the miles themselves.  Each sunrise brings renewed hope, each sunset a stark reminder of the vastness of her journey and the perilous unknowns that lie ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ry" Thorne pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across multiple planets within the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps are fraught with the risk of encountering space pirates and navigating unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  While Ry's advanced technology provides a degree of comfort compared to Elara's journey, the vastness of space, the isolation, and the ever-present threat of the unknown evoke a similar sense of awe and terrifying wonder.
