
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of hope in her eyes burned brighter than any campfire, fueled by the unwavering loyalty of her companions and the unwavering promise of a cure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate a new source of dilithium for the dwindling reserves of the United Federation.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying; shimmering celestial bodies,  gravity wells threatening to crush her ship, and the unnerving silence punctuated only by the hum of her engines. But Eva, a seasoned explorer, faced the cosmic unknown with a steely gaze and the thrill of discovery coursing through her veins, forever pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
