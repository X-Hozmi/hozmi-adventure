
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a powerful lost magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of adventure, and the promise of glory, spurred them forward, their resolve hardened by hardship and tempered by camaraderie.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in years of hyperspace travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the call of the unknown, the potential for discovery, and the hope of reuniting with lost kin propelled Eva and her crew, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
