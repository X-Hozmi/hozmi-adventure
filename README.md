
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power, guarded by treacherous mountains and even more treacherous men.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down his spine – a constant reminder of the dangers that stalked him on this perilous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aerthos.  He carried little but hope, a worn map, and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, but fraught with the perils of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory cruisers of the Kryll Hegemony tested the limits of both her ship and her courage.  The vast expanse of the galaxy stretched before her, a tapestry of wonder and danger, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.  The fate of her crew, and perhaps humanity itself, rested on the successful completion of this interstellar voyage.
