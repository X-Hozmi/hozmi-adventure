
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the seed of a new life, a desperate hope for a future beyond the plague-ridden village she’d left behind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the barren fields, was a reminder of the immense journey ahead, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Reaching the rumored haven in the East was a gamble, but a gamble she was willing to take.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a calculated risk, fueled by the promise of a habitable planet, Kepler-186f.  The hyperspace jump had been harrowing, the navigation complex, but the breathtaking panorama of distant galaxies from her viewport justified every moment of peril. The quest for a new home was a legacy, one forged not in the shadow of disease, but under the boundless expanse of the universe.
