
Sir Gareth, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, a tapestry of green and brown stretching to the horizon.  Each bend held the promise of bandit ambush or wild beast, a constant reminder of the perils faced by any who dared to travel far from the comforting walls of a castle.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains – was fraught with danger, but the lure of untold riches and glory spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating by the faint pulse of distant quasars, she charted a course towards the unexplored Kepler-186f system.  The vast emptiness of space was a constant companion, punctuated only by the occasional burst of static from the ship's comms and the hum of the hyperdrive.  The rewards of discovery, the potential for new resources and alien civilizations, were worth the risk of encountering rogue asteroids, solar flares, or even… something else entirely, lurking in the unexplored corners of the galaxy.
