
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold riches beyond imagining – or perhaps only death at the hands of brigands and monstrous beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a thrilling mixture of fear and anticipation. He clutched the ancient map, its faded ink hinting at the treacherous journey yet to come – through sun-baked deserts, across raging rivers, and over towering, snow-capped mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast, unknowable distances separating them from home.  The thrill of exploration, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the sheer wonder of the cosmos all coalesced into a powerful force driving her forward, towards the unknown possibilities that awaited them among the stars.
