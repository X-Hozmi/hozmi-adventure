
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or ambush. Yet, the allure of Ys, and the hope it represented, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with perils unseen.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing vital systems in the inky blackness became commonplace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, but the promise of discovery and the hope of finding the lost colonists fueled her resolve across the cosmic ocean.
