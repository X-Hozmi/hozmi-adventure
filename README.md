The journey across the craggy Spine of the World mountains was proving arduous, each day a battle against unforgiving terrain and the ever-present threat of bandits.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, his gaze fixed on the distant, snow-capped peaks – the promised land of Eldoria, rumored to hold the legendary Sunstone.
