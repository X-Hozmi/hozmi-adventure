
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear thick in the air. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's illness, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the relentless desert tested her endurance at every turn.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, yet the vastness of the unknown stretched before her like a tantalizing and terrifying promise.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped into hyperspace, leaving the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way behind.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, rumored to hold resources vital to the survival of her colony.  The jump itself was a gamble, the nebula a labyrinth of cosmic radiation and unpredictable gravitational fields.  But the potential rewards – a future for her people – outweighed the risks, propelling her ever onwards into the inky black, a lone explorer charting a course through the vast, unforgiving ocean of space.
