
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of steel from a passing mercenary band, punctuated her perilous journey to Constantinople.  Whispers of a lost city, rumored to hold unimaginable treasures, fueled her onward, despite the ever-present dangers of bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Her worn map, a patchwork of guesses and rumors, was her only guide through the vast, untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes, Rexx relied on his instincts and the ship's archaic navigation system, a marvel of salvaged alien technology. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, stretched endlessly around them, promising both unimaginable discovery and potential annihilation.
