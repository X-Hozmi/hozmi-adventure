
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village he'd fled.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous river crossing, each wary glance at the darkening forest, fed the thrill of his perilous journey across the uncharted lands of the Holy Roman Empire.  Every sunrise brought the promise of new danger, and new hope.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast distances separating her from home.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial patrols of the Kryll Hegemony was commonplace, but the true adventure lay in the unknown – the possibility of discovering not just a new route through space, but a new understanding of the universe itself.
