
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine are constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise bringing new challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of whether she'll ever reach her destination.  Yet, the glint of hope in her eyes burns brighter than any midday sun, fueled by the love for her brother and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance pilots her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hum, alien landscapes flash past the viewport, and the constant hum of the ship's systems is a familiar lullaby.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate gangs are commonplace hazards in this vast expanse, but the allure of discovery and the camaraderie of her crew outweigh the danger. The cosmos holds infinite possibilities, and Ryla, with unwavering determination, is ready to find them.
