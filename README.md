
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Ardennes Forest, shadows lengthening ominously as twilight approached.  Bandits were rumored to prowl these woods, and the weight of the King's decree – a vital message to the besieged castle of Martel – pressed heavily upon him.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, fueling his determination to reach his destination, no matter the cost.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system was calculated, but the unpredictable space currents presented a constant challenge.  Her crew, a motley bunch of seasoned explorers, monitored the ship's systems while Eva plotted a course through shimmering nebulae and asteroid fields, the vastness of the cosmos a breathtaking, and terrifying, backdrop to their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos crystals rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The fate of humanity, it seemed, hung in the balance.
