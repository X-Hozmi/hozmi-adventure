
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate quest for a rumored spring said to heal the plague ravaging their village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the thrill and terror of the unknown.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey, a true test of resilience and faith in a world unforgiving and beautiful in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Talon piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f system, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Rexx. But the true adventure lay not in the perils of space, but in the potential for discovery – a new world, new technologies, and the uncertain future that awaited him on the other side of the galaxy.
