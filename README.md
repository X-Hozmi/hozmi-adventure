
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send man and beast tumbling to their doom, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating confusing river deltas to bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, yet the lure of Zerzura propelled him onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through a nebula shimmering with impossible colours. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Kryll, a sentient spacefaring species, tested her skills and her crew's resolve to their limits. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless unknowns, but the hope of finding survivors, of bringing a lost civilization back into the fold, fueled their daring interstellar voyage.
