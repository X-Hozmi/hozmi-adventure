
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s caravan lurched across the parched landscape.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each hawk cry overhead, felt monumental on this perilous journey across the unforgiving plains to the rumored city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the desert itself were constant companions. Yet, the promise of untold riches and a legendary oasis fueled their desperate trek, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation for the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, its engines humming a low thrum against the backdrop of cosmic wonders.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony demanded nerves of steel and the unwavering trust of a seasoned crew. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held its own terrifying unknowns, making this interstellar voyage a gamble of epic proportions.
