
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the splintered kingdoms.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled my nostrils, a stark contrast to the salty air of the coast I'd left behind.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, spurred me onward – a whisper of untold riches and perhaps, even more. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were small price to pay for the potential glory that lay ahead, somewhere beyond the next horizon.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  My vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of a nebula.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  But the galaxy is a dangerous place; pirate fleets, rogue AI, and uncharted anomalies threaten to end my expedition before I even reach my destination. The rewards, however, promise to rewrite the laws of physics and reshape the future of interstellar travel.
