
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddle as I guide my destrier across the sun-baked plains of France.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant battle hangs heavy in the air. My quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the long grass, heightens the tension, a constant reminder of the perils that lie ahead in this unpredictable medieval world.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive lulls me into a false sense of security as we navigate the swirling nebula of Xylos. My mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylian crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light years.  The vastness of space, the potential for catastrophic engine failure, and the unpredictable nature of alien encounters far exceed any danger I faced on those medieval plains, replacing bandits and disease with cosmic radiation and hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the thrill of exploration remains the same, an unyielding human drive to push boundaries and venture into the unknown.
