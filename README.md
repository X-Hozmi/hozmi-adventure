
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to make a difference, pushed her relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravity wells of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a world teeming with undiscovered life and resources, fueled her crew. The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful canvas of swirling colours and cosmic dust, held a different kind of danger – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the silent threat of asteroid fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  But for Ryla, the exploration of the unknown was worth the risk.
