
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every league traversed, the thrill of the unknown fueled my journey.  The whispered tales of the mythical city of Eldoria, lost somewhere beyond the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, spurred me onward, a beacon in the vast, untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars streaked past in vibrant, impossible colours as we jumped from one celestial body to the next, a network of wormholes our highway.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of space pirates. But the allure of discovery remained the same, a driving force pushing me to explore the uncharted regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for the legendary lost colony of Xylos, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.
