
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat or a fleeting promise of salvation in a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  He rode towards the unknown, his heart filled with both dread and unwavering hope.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million burning suns. Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies in search of habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the dangers remained constant – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters, both friendly and hostile. The vastness of the cosmos, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, stretched before her, a journey of unimaginable scale and profound uncertainty.
