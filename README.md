
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked her every step.  The journey was arduous, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting drone against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Navigation was a complex dance of astrogation and precise calculations, each jump a gamble against unforeseen celestial events or pirate raids.  The universe offered breathtaking vistas and unimaginable riches, but also the terrifying expanse of the unknown and the constant risk of mechanical failure light years from any form of rescue.
