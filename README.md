
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers, forging a bond between the knight and his young companion stronger than any steel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was less about physical hardship and more about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and managing the complex astrogation systems of her vessel.  But the stakes were higher, the potential rewards immeasurable, and the solitude of interstellar travel a constant companion in the vast, echoing emptiness of space.
