
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandit ambushes in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes guarded by snow leopards, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, fueled by his love for his sister, pushed him relentlessly across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, but the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, while the alien landscape promised encounters with creatures far beyond human comprehension.  Yet, the future of humanity rested on her shoulders, driving her onward into the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
