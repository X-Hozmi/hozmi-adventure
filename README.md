
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the sun a molten orb sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her journey across the fractured kingdom of Aeridor had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings swollen with spring melt, and the constant gnawing fear of encountering the dreaded warlocks said to haunt the desolate plains.  Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled Sunstone, a relic of untold power, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Navigating the treacherous cosmic currents between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies was a test of skill and nerve, a far cry from the relative calm of interplanetary trade routes.  The whispers of the Xylos system, rumored to hold a key to faster-than-light travel,  pulled her deeper into the uncharted void.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and deadly dangers, each jump a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
