
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had already tested their resilience. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – navigating unfamiliar terrain, bartering for meager supplies, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers in far-flung villages.  Their adventure was a tapestry woven with hardship, but also moments of breathtaking beauty and unexpected camaraderie.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, was a constant companion.  Communication lags stretched conversations into agonizing delays, and the threat of pirate attacks – or worse, encountering unknown alien species – was ever-present.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to unravel the mystery of the lost colony, fueled her relentless journey across the cosmos.
