
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the disease itself stalked the land as relentlessly as the shadows.  He carried with him not only a sword, but a desperate hope, and a map older than any king.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years towards the Kepler-186f system.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's relentless push beyond the cradle of Earth.  Her mission: to establish a colony on a potentially habitable exoplanet, braving the dangers of unknown alien life and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  The galaxy, vast and beautiful, held both promise and peril in equal measure.
