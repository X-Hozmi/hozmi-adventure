
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling fiefdom and a vengeful Baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse grasses, held the promise of both peril and possibility.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague haunted every village she passed, yet the allure of the unknown, the vast, untamed land stretching before her, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast emptiness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were mere inconveniences compared to the weight of her mission – to establish a foothold for humanity amongst the stars, a daunting task made all the more challenging by the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel and the looming threat of unknown alien encounters.
