
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in fiery hues. Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek healing for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the muddy roads treacherous, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward, each sunrise a new challenge, each weary mile a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor"  Rylan steered his starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate incursions were commonplace hazards on his intergalactic trade route.  The promise of rare Xylossian crystals, coveted across the known galaxies, was worth the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, each distant planet a potential treasure trove or deadly trap, but the thrill of exploration and the allure of the unknown kept Razor pushing ever further into the cosmic frontier.
