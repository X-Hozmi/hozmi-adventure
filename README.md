
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each day was a gamble—bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of forgotten magic, propelled her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rendar steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Warp jumps were risky, pirate attacks a constant threat, and the alien landscapes of unexplored planets held mysteries both wondrous and terrifying. But Razor, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, thrived on the challenge.  The cosmos beckoned, a vast ocean of stars filled with untold riches and the promise of adventure far beyond human comprehension.
