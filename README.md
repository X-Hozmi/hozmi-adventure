
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to house both mythical beasts and brigands more dangerous still.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the Duke, a journey fraught with peril but essential to her family's survival.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, reminding her of the unforgiving nature of this medieval world and the unpredictable path ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years away.  This wasn't a simple cross-country trek; it was a voyage across the unimaginable vastness of space,  a gamble against the unknown hazards of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The fate of her colony rested on the success of this intergalactic expedition.
