
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains.  Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling ruins, and the relentless sun threatened to drain their strength.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present fear of encountering hostile tribes.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred them onward.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara's starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the veil of nebulae, its destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a distant binary sun.  The journey across galaxies took years, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the quiet hum of the crew going about their duties.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate raids were just a small part of the risks involved; the true danger lay in the unknown of this new world – its hostile environments, its strange creatures, and perhaps, its sentient inhabitants.  The vast emptiness of space, however, paled in comparison to the thrilling anticipation of discovery.
