
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of worn leather and sun-bleached canvas, creaks across the unforgiving landscape.  Dust devils dance in the distance as we navigate treacherous mountain passes, the scent of pine and fear thick in the air.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing uncertainty of bandits, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of the unknown wilderness.  Yet, the allure of the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, fuels our relentless journey.  The promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge pushes us onward, one weary step at a time.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky blackness of interstellar space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents are daily challenges, but the breathtaking views of nebulae painted across the void are a constant source of wonder.  The thrill of discovery, of being among the first humans to set foot on another world, eclipses the inherent risks, fueling our relentless pursuit of new frontiers and the ever-present possibility of encountering other forms of life.
