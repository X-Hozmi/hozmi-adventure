
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped across the vast, empty plains of France, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant cries of wild birds.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a prayer for survival as he traversed the unpredictable landscapes of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the unknown. The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, held both wonder and danger.  Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable expanse of the galaxy.
