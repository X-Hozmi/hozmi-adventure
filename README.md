
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Her worn leather satchel holds more than just provisions; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid clutched in her trembling hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplifies the ever-present threat of bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  This journey, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the devastating plague, is a gamble with life itself, a test of endurance against the brutal indifference of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel is a double-edged sword; the cosmic radiation a constant threat, the vast distances a lonely expanse punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the ship's engines.  Ancient maps, cryptic transmissions, and the whispers of intergalactic pirates guide her across the uncharted territories of space,  where every jump through the warp could lead to untold riches...or utter annihilation.
