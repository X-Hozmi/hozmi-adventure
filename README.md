
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel bulging with questionable herbs and a chipped map promising riches in the fabled city of Ys.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion, far more menacing than any brigand.  Each sunrise brought the promise of breathtaking vistas, perilous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, fueling her desperate journey toward a destiny shrouded in myth.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hyperdrive humming a discordant song against the backdrop of a million dying stars. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the hostile K'tharr homeworld, a planet teeming with predatory lifeforms and guarded by ancient, sentient weaponry.  The galaxy stretched before him, a tapestry of wonder and peril, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of space.  The stakes were cosmic, the adventure infinitely more dangerous than any medieval quest.
