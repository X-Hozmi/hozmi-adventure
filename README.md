
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Rhône Valley stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a few dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a map – more a hopeful scribble than a true guide – leading her to the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her brother’s fever.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, was a reminder of the dangers that lay ahead: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Her adventure was a desperate gamble, a journey fueled by love and sheer will.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity, a gamble even riskier than Elara's medieval trek.  But instead of bandits, Ryla faced void storms and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Instead of starvation, there was the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the vast, unforgiving darkness.  Her journey, a testament to human ambition, was propelled by hope for a brighter future, a quest to find a new Eden amongst the cold, glittering expanse of the cosmos.
