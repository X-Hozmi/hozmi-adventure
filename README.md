
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed.  Yet, with every creak of her saddle and beat of her weary steed's hooves, Elara’s resolve hardened, spurred on by the promise of adventure and the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting the viewport in a breathtaking cosmic masterpiece. Their mission: to chart unmapped galaxies, searching for habitable planets amidst the celestial tapestry. The risks were different now – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  But the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration into the infinite expanse of space, fuelled their intrepid voyage, a new kind of medieval quest for the stars.
