
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a few dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and the tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of starvation.  But the unwavering hope for her brother's survival fueled her onward, making each sunrise a new chapter in her perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising valuable resources and a new colony for humanity.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Unlike the medieval adventurers of old, Eva commanded a sophisticated starship, but the courage and determination required to face the unknown remained the same, a timeless thread woven through the tapestry of human exploration.
