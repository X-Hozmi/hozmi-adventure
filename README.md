
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The King's ransom, a chest bound in iron, jostled precariously behind him.  His journey from Acre to Paris was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory, but the lure of wealth and the whisper of glory spurred him across the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across lightyears of interstellar dust. The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was not measured in days or weeks, but in generations of frozen sleep punctuated by brief awakenings.  The thrill of discovery, the allure of uncharted planets rich with alien life and untold resources, far outweighed the loneliness of the void and the constant hum of the ship's engines.  The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, was her playground.
