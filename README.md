
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The journey across the Kingdom of Francia had already tested him – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the gnawing hunger that stalked him like a phantom.  But the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, with its whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic, spurred him onwards, each hardship merely a stepping stone on his perilous quest.  The hope of glory, and perhaps even survival, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement that vanished without a trace generations ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded unwavering focus and skill, a constant battle against the unforgiving vastness of space.  The weight of her crew's lives, and the potential for discovery, pressed down on her as she charted a course into the unknown, a modern-day odyssey among the stars.
