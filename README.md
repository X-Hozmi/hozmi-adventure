
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the shadows,  a near-fatal encounter with a rabid wolf, and the constant gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, said to possess untold power, fueled his relentless pursuit. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both danger and the potential for glorious discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life.  But the promise of charting new worlds, of uncovering the secrets of the universe, outweighed every risk, driving her and her crew across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
