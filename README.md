
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious seeds for a new life promised in a distant, rumored valley of plenty.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the road, but the image of fertile fields fueled her onward.  The whispered tales of the valley, passed between weary travelers at smoky inns, were her compass, guiding her through the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Cluster, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of charting unmapped territories among the stars, outweighed the risks, pushing her relentlessly forward through the inky black.
