
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Each day brought new trials – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and knowledge, spurred him onward, the image of Zerzura's shimmering spires burning bright in his mind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The vast expanse of space, a canvas of vibrant colours and cosmic dust, held both wonder and peril.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of solar flares, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel were daily realities.  Yet, the knowledge that she was a pioneer, forging a path for humanity amongst the stars, fueled her resolve, driving her ever further into the uncharted darkness.
