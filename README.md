
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  The quest for the lost city of Eldoria had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy heart of the Whispering Woods.  Bandits, storms, and starvation had thinned his company, but the glimmer of gold and the promise of forgotten magic spurred him on, each sunrise a renewed pledge to overcome the obstacles that lay between him and his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital genetic samples from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and managing the ship's dwindling fuel reserves were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacefarer.  But the allure of scientific discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the universe, pushed her and her crew to brave the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
