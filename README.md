
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had tested her spirit and her endurance.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes demanded careful navigation, and the constant threat of disease and starvation hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the whispered legends of the sacred city fueling her weary steps.  She carried with her not only a simple scrip but a heart brimming with hope and the unwavering determination of a medieval adventurer.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals across three galaxies, a feat considered suicidal by most.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading ruthless space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of warp travel were all in a day's work.  But it was the thrill of charting unexplored sectors, the sheer audacity of traversing the cosmos, that truly captivated him.  The universe was his playground, and the galaxy's infinite wonders, his reward for risking it all.
