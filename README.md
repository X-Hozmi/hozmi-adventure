
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the potential for banditry, or worse. Her quest – to deliver a vital message to Avignon – was a perilous undertaking, fraught with dangers both natural and man-made.  She navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded rushing rivers, and bribed surly innkeepers, her resolve strengthened by the weight of her responsibility and the promise of adventure that lay at the end of each dusty mile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Karlsen steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a feat deemed impossible by many.  The journey was a symphony of shimmering starlight and calculated risks, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational currents.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown;  but the allure of discovery, of mapping the cosmos, fueled his daring expedition across the uncharted expanse of space.
