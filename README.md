
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in silks – and a king's curse if he failed to deliver them to the distant city of Prague.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all obstacles on his arduous journey across the fragmented kingdoms of Europe, each league a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The gleam of distant towers promised both reward and relief, a fragile hope against the backdrop of a dangerous and unpredictable world.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital genetic samples from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth and a universe away from the medieval struggles of her ancestors.  Faster-than-light travel had opened the cosmos, but the dangers remained; rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space all tested the crew's courage and resilience.  The promise of scientific advancement fueled their journey, a bold leap into the unknown echoing the adventurous spirit of those who once braved the earth's treacherous landscapes.
