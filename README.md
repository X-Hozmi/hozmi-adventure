
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the vast plains of Aquitaine was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in sparsely populated villages. Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and potentially lethal alien flora.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, the vast, silent expanse of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Faster-than-light travel was a wonder, but the loneliness of interstellar travel, the sheer isolation of being light-years from home, tested the mettle of even the most seasoned spacefarer.
