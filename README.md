He clutched the tattered map, its ink faded but promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  He pressed on, driven by a thirst for adventure and the lure of the unknown, his fate hanging in the balance with every sunrise.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and establish trade routes for the interstellar federation.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering brilliance of distant stars and the occasional meteor shower, held a thrill as potent as any medieval quest.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and the insatiable desire to explore the cosmos.
