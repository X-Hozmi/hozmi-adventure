
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, fueled her relentless trek.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of discovery, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in the starship *Stardust*.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The journey was fraught with peril; rogue asteroids, treacherous gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made each hyperspace jump a gamble.  Yet, the crew, a motley but dedicated bunch, pressed on, driven by the same insatiable curiosity that had propelled explorers for millennia.  The vastness of space held both terrifying and wondrous possibilities, each new star system a universe waiting to be explored.
