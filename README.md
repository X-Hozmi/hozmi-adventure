
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of London, the air thick with the smell of woodsmoke and unwashed bodies.  Ahead lies the treacherous, unpredictable path to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fraught with peril. We'll brave bandit-infested forests, ford raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigate the labyrinthine politics of feuding lords.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – a broken wagon wheel in the remote mountains, a sudden storm that threatens to drown us, or the chilling suspicion that we are not alone on this road, followed by the unsettling sounds of rustling in the dark. Our survival depends on our wits, our strength, and the kindness of strangers encountered along the dusty trails.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive, a symphony of controlled chaos as we leap across the void between galaxies. Our destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The crew navigates asteroid fields the size of small moons, evades the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, and contends with the unpredictable nature of warp travel itself.  Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk against the crushing weight of space. But the promise of Xylos, of uncovering secrets older than time itself, fuels our resolve as we push ever deeper into the uncharted expanse.
