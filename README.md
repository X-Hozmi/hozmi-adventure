
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The King's summons to the far north, a whispered rumour of a dragon's hoard, had lured him from the comfort of his manor.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new panorama of rolling hills, dense forests, and treacherous mountain passes.  He navigated by the stars, his only companions the chirping crickets and the occasional wolf's howl –  a stark contrast to the glittering courts he was used to.  Each encounter, whether a friendly village or a band of brigands, added a new chapter to his adventure, testing his courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a jewel shimmering billions of light years away.  The journey was a symphony of warp speeds and gravitational tugs, a ballet of precision and daring.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates were everyday occurrences, the vast emptiness of space a stark contrast to the bustling spaceports of her homeworld. The reward, however, was a universe of potential, a testament to humankind’s boundless ambition to explore the cosmos.
