
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had taken them through dense forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and over rivers swollen with spring melt. Each day brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, skirmishes with rival knights, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, with its rumored fountains of youth and streets paved with gold, fueled their relentless pursuit.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling Galactic Federation, a resource rumored to exist on the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  The journey was fraught with peril; navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and combating the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies.  But the potential reward, the salvation of billions, pushed Eva and her crew to overcome impossible odds, charting a course through the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
