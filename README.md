
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors that fueled his journey – whispers of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, nestled deep within the Whisperwind Forest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive resonated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Though dangers lurked in the form of asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of warp travel itself, Eva felt the same thrill as any medieval adventurer – the intoxicating allure of the unknown, the unwavering pursuit of discovery, driving her relentlessly forward.
