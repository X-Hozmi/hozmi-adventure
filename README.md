
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the wind.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, the constant threat of starvation and disease.  But the whispered tales of Ys, and the desperate hope it offered, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  His only companions were his loyal steed and the unwavering belief in a legend that might save his people.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, before the tyrannical K'tharr Empire could claim it.  Navigation through uncharted asteroid fields and skirmishes with K'tharr cruisers were commonplace.  The vast distances between stars were punctuated by the quiet hum of the ship's engines and the camaraderie of her diverse crew.  The fate of countless worlds rested on her shoulders, a weight far heavier than any earthly burden, as she charted a course through the infinite expanse of space.
