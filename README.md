
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested their endurance, and the gnawing hunger was a relentless companion. Yet, the whispered promise of miracles and the thrill of the unknown spurred them on, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the vast, unpredictable landscape.  Their battered horses were their only allies in a world teeming with both beauty and brutality.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colors painted a breathtaking canvas against the backdrop of a thousand distant suns, but the true beauty lay in the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against unknown gravitational forces and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, shared her thirst for discovery, their courage fueled by the limitless expanse of the cosmos and the promise of untold wonders waiting to be found.
