
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promised a hidden monastery holding a legendary healing balm – a desperate hope for her plague-stricken village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit attack, wild animal, or the looming threat of starvation.  But the burning sun on her back fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the monastery a beacon in the harsh reality of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the galaxy, a signal barely clinging to existence in the cosmic static.  The jump gates flickered, spitting his vessel into uncharted territories where unknown dangers lurked – rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions.  Yet, the faint hope of finding Aethel, the promise of survival in the vast emptiness, propelled him forward into the infinite expanse.
