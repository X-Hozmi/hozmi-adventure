
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône Valley.  Her worn map, a testament to countless journeys, offered little solace against the biting wind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, sent shivers down her spine – reminders of the bandits and wild beasts that haunted these forgotten paths.  Her quest – to deliver a sacred relic to a distant abbey – was a perilous undertaking, a test of endurance and faith against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae outside her viewport were breathtaking, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engine.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey requiring years of hyperspace travel and a nerve of steel.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was also a lonely and dangerous place, filled with unforeseen cosmic phenomena and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of the void.
