
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried figs and a chipped map, her only companions the gnawing hunger in her belly and the ever-present fear of bandits. Yet, the whispered tales of the legendary Sunstone, said to grant immortality, spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder that survival, and perhaps even greatness, lay just beyond the next horizon.

Centuries hence, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored paradise lost amidst a chaotic cluster of unexplored systems.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, yet the potential dangers – pirate fleets, unstable wormholes, and uncharted alien life – kept his hand steady on the controls.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with nebulae and scattered starlight, both awed and terrified him; this journey, a gamble between glory and annihilation, was the ultimate test of a starship captain's mettle.
