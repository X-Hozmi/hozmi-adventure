
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on his worn leather armour.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous mountain pass, represented a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the very elements themselves.  The whispered legends of Eldoria fueled his determination, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of despair.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, scattered across the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light jumps were punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, was a constant companion as Elara charted a course through unmapped star systems, driven by the hope of finding her ancestors and unraveling the mystery of their disappearance.
