
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of courtly love and valiant knights.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the relentless ache in their bones from the unforgiving terrain. Yet, amidst the hardship, a fierce camaraderie bloomed, forged in shared adversity and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, each sunrise a gamble, each sunset a hard-won victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between space and time, but the challenges were no less daunting.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions tested her skills and the resilience of her crew.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, spurred them on, fueled by a shared sense of purpose and the insatiable human hunger for exploration.
