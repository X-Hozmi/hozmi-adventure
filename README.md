
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a battle against the biting wind that whipped across the desolate plains.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World mountains, a legendary range rumored to hold both untold riches and perilous beasts. My meager pack held only dried meat, a waterskin, and the hope of finding the lost city of Eldoria – a fool's errand, some say, but the glint of gold in the eyes of my dying father fuels my journey. The rough track ahead offered no easy path; only the unwavering rhythm of my own heartbeat and the distant cry of a hawk to keep me company.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant lullaby against the backdrop of the swirling nebula.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and star-chart navigators, were a source of both camaraderie and constant bickering.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers; rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders all loomed in the inky black. But the thrill of discovery, the chance to push the boundaries of human knowledge, outweighed every risk.
