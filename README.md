
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of  worn leather and hopeful faces, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance in the distance, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts. We're bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold, said to lie beyond the treacherous Serpent's Pass.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle of the wind, holds the promise of both wonder and peril; bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving desert itself threaten to swallow us whole.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, the whispered legends of untold riches and forgotten magic, keeps our weary spirits alight.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, cutting through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet veiled in emerald nebulae, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colors and distant suns, both terrifies and enthralls.  We face the unknown – hostile alien lifeforms, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure – but the potential rewards, the unlocking of a galactic future, fuel our journey across the cosmic ocean.
