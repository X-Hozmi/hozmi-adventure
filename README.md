
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant wolves.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery as he traversed treacherous mountain passes and skirted the borders of hostile kingdoms, his trusty blade his only companion in this desperate race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking tapestry of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the disparate human colonies scattered across the cosmos.  Navigating asteroid fields and traversing wormholes, Eva faced challenges far beyond any medieval knight:  relativistic time dilation, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space. The vastness of the universe, both terrifying and exhilarating, lay before her.
