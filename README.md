
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's weary band trudged across the sun-baked plains.  Their quest, to recover the stolen relic of St. Alba, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests where whispers of bandits and mythical beasts haunted the nights.  Each day brought new challenges – starvation, skirmishes with rival knights, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the glint of the rumored holy grail spurred them onward, a beacon in the harsh realities of their medieval journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-lost colony on the edge of known space, a perilous voyage across uncharted galaxies.  The ship bucked against gravitational forces, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes.  Alien lifeforms, both beautiful and terrifying, posed constant threats, while the ship's aging systems constantly threatened catastrophic failure.  But the promise of knowledge, and the weight of her crew's lives, fueled her determination to complete her interstellar expedition.
