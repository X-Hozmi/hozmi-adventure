
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the Spine of the World mountains loomed, a jagged scar against the bruised purple sky. My journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in taverns and sung by wandering bards, had been fraught with peril: brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to my resilience.

Or perhaps, centuries hence, I'm piloting the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebulae of Xylos, its iridescent colours painting my viewport in a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to harbour life unlike anything ever encountered.  The jump gates between star systems hum with impossible energies, and the void between worlds is a silent, awe-inspiring ocean, punctuated only by the distant twinkle of alien suns.  The adventure here is not of bandits and blizzards, but of navigating treacherous wormholes and facing the unknown wonders – or terrors – of other worlds.
