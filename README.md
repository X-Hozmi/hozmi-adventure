The sun beat down mercilessly, baking the earth and testing the endurance of both man and beast.  Each day brought new challenges - bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine.

The allure of distant lands, rumored cities of gold, and untold riches fueled their spirits, driving them ever forward towards the unknown.

Their mission: to chart these uncharted territories, to discover alien cultures, and to unlock the mysteries of the cosmos.
