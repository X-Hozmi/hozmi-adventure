
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the creak of leather and groan of wood a constant counterpoint to the rhythmic beat of hooves.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, the hope of salvation fuelled his journey, transforming every hardship into a stepping stone towards his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust painting her viewport in ethereal hues.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across a dozen planets after a devastating solar flare.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifts threatened to tear the vessel apart, and the vast, unknowable expanse of space instilled a quiet awe mixed with constant, underlying danger.  But the possibility of finding survivors, of reuniting a lost civilization, pushed her onward, past asteroids and rogue planets, towards the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
