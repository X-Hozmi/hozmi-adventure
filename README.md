
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the splintered kingdoms.  The chill wind whipped at my cloak, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth, a stark contrast to the stench of the port city we'd left behind.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient texts of untold power, had lured me from my quiet life, a quest fueled by equal parts ambition and a desperate need for escape.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes were but minor inconveniences in pursuit of such a prize.

Centuries later, the sleek obsidian hull of my starship sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hyperdrive hummed a low, resonant thrum, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse surrounding us.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a technology that could revolutionize interstellar exploration – or destroy it.  The risks were staggering, the potential rewards immeasurable. The journey, a solitary voyage across light-years of unimaginable wonder and potential peril.
