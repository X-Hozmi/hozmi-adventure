
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the Black Death, whose shadow stretched before her like a spectral hand.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting kindness from weary travelers, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown, but the hope of her brother's survival spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of space still held its own brand of peril.  Pirate raids, unpredictable wormhole distortions, and the ever-present threat of engine failure all loomed larger than any earthly danger.  Yet, the responsibility to those reliant on his cargo fueled Rexx’s courage, pushing him across the cosmic sea towards a distant hope.
