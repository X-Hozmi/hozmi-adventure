
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping in the biting wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving landscape, promising both peril and potential glory.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the mythical Sunstone, rumored to be hidden deep within the barbarian lands. Each creak of saddle leather, each beat of the horse's hooves, was a step closer to fortune, or perhaps, oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems were all part of a day’s work for a seasoned spacefarer.  The vast, unknown expanse of the cosmos held both infinite wonders and terrifying unknowns, but the promise of discovery – of finding a new home for humanity – fuelled her journey across the interstellar void.
