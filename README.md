
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the scent of pine and impending storm thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to reach the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each day is a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger, but the unwavering gleam in her eyes reflects a determination forged in hardship and fueled by the desperate needs of those she left behind.  The road ahead is long and perilous, but Elara presses on, her spirit as unyielding as the mountains themselves.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the colossal engines of the 'Stardust Drifter' humming a steady rhythm against the backdrop of a million dying stars.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by sentient flora.  The journey across galaxies is a test of his piloting skills and the ship's resilience, constantly battling cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions lurking in the shadows of hyperspace.  The fate of his crew, and perhaps even humanity, rests on the success of this perilous interstellar voyage.
