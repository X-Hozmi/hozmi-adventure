
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the distant Pyrenees mountains a hazy promise of safety.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hastily scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present fear of bandits. Each creak of her saddlebag, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her – a constant reminder of the perils of traversing the unforgiving landscape between kingdoms, a journey undertaken to find a rumored cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas clouds painting the viewport in breathtaking, terrifying hues.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of shimmering stars and dark, empty voids, held a different kind of fear – the cold, impersonal danger of malfunctioning warp drives and unpredictable celestial events.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries further than ever before, fuelled her onward.
