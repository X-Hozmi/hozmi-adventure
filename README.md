
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking ford, each whispering forest, each encounter with suspicious travelers represented a gamble, a test of her courage and resilience against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Survival itself was the ultimate adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Sharma navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission, far more ambitious than Elara's, was to locate a lost colony on the edge of known space, a civilization whispered to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.   Each jump through hyperspace, each perilous encounter with space pirates or unpredictable gravitational anomalies, pushed her and her crew to their limits, testing their skills and their bonds in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
