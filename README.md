
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, fueled both his anticipation and a healthy dose of fear. Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  He pressed on, driven by a thirst for adventure and the promise of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony required skill, courage, and a healthy dose of luck.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the potential for discovery, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories propelled Eva and her crew ever forward, towards the furthest reaches of the cosmos.
