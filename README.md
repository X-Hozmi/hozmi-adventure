
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest, to find the lost monastery of St. Jude, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across babbling brooks teeming with unseen dangers, and into the shadowy heart of the Whispering Woods where rumors of goblin raids were as common as the gnarled trees themselves.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to outwitting highwaymen, his only companions the stars and the unwavering hope burning in his breast.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of incandescent purple and gold. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable wormholes, a far cry from the simple maps of Thomas's time.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the tantalizing possibility of discovery, echoed across the vast gulf of time, connecting the medieval traveler and the futuristic explorer in a shared spirit of adventure.
