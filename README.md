
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their worn map, stained with mud and sweat, promised riches in the distant city of Eldoria, a legendary metropolis said to hold treasures beyond imagining.  Each creak of their saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their arduous journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace. The vastness of space held a different kind of peril; silent, implacable dangers lurking in the dark between the stars. Yet, the hope of reconnecting with lost humanity, of uncovering new worlds and civilizations, fueled her relentless journey across the galaxy.
