Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage spurred by a desperate hope for her ailing brother, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the constant gnawing hunger was a more formidable foe than any knight.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed determination burned within her, fueled by the unwavering love for her kin and the thrill of the unknown road ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The shimmering cosmic dust, breathtakingly beautiful, held no warmth against the bone-chilling vacuum of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Years of perilous jumps through wormholes and daring escapes from pirate fleets had honed her into a hardened but compassionate leader. The vastness of the galaxy, a canvas of infinite stars and uncharted planets, offered both unparalleled beauty and terrifying dangers – a testament to the enduring human spirit's relentless pursuit of exploration, even across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
