
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed, entrusted to her by the dying abbot – a seed rumored to hold the cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the abbot's faith fueled her relentless journey eastward, towards the fabled monastery of Saint Jude.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was a daily routine, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned Xylos colony, a core potentially holding the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were astronomical, the unknowns infinite, but the potential reward – a new era of interstellar exploration – made the perilous journey across the vast cosmic ocean worthwhile.
