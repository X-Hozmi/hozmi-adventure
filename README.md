
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, a worn map clutched in her frostbitten hand. Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each rocky pass, each treacherous river crossing, is a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the harsh elements.  Her journey is not just miles, but a measure of her unwavering devotion and fierce determination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through a cosmic maelstrom.  The mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold both untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  Her crew, a motley bunch of seasoned explorers and ambitious rookies, face not only the perils of interstellar travel but also the political intrigue and alien encounters that lie in wait at the edge of known space.
