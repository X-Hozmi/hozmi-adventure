
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred him onward, transforming the arduous journey into a pilgrimage of faith and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were child's play compared to the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a steely gaze and a heart full of daring, pressed onward, driven by the promise of a future beyond the known cosmos.
