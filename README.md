
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains dwarfing her tiny caravan.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain paths, greedy bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura’s shimmering spires and miraculous healing waters fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to human resilience in a world ruled by chance and fate.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. His mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the loneliness of interstellar exploration was a constant companion.  Each jump into the unknown brought the thrill of discovery – a new world, a new species – but also the ever-present danger of encountering hostile lifeforms or encountering navigational anomalies that could strand him light-years from civilization.  The cosmos, vast and indifferent, was both a playground and a potential tomb.
