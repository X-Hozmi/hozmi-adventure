
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on her back.  Her journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite expanse.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable currents of hyperspace always held a sliver of danger.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies in search of habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, the beauty of alien worlds, and the constant threat of rogue asteroids and unknown celestial phenomena were far removed from Elara's medieval struggles, yet both women shared a common thread: the unwavering courage to chase the unknown.
