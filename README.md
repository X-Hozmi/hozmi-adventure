
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of distant spires, promising hope and perhaps salvation, spurred her onward, a testament to the unwavering human spirit in the face of adversity.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival on a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel was a wonder, but cosmic anomalies and pirate fleets posed constant dangers.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held both unimaginable promise and terrifying unknowns, a stark contrast to the familiar, grounded struggles of her medieval predecessors, yet mirroring their indomitable spirit of exploration.
