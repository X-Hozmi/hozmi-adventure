
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseilles, a cacophony of smells and sounds that quickly faded as we ventured inland.  Dust choked our throats and the relentless sun beat down upon our backs as we traversed the rough, unforgiving terrain of medieval France.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of discovering new lands and cultures, spurred us onward, our weathered faces reflecting the hardships and exhilaration of our epic overland adventure.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was the only constant companion amidst the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue stars demanded unwavering precision, while the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps kept us on edge.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the potential rewards – the advancement of human civilization and the exploration of uncharted territories beyond our wildest imaginings – made the risks worthwhile.
