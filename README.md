
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, with every creak of the saddle and each breathtaking vista, the lure of the unknown propelled him further into the heart of the uncharted wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her starship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp jumps across light years, the constant hum of the hyperdrive, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks were her realities. Yet, the vast, unexplored cosmos beckoned, promising untold riches and knowledge beyond human comprehension, driving her onward through the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of space.
