
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, urged his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track leading across the treacherous Ardennes Forest.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the shimmering heat haze: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest, to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas and secure a sacred relic, felt more daunting with every passing league.  The hope of glory, and the whispers of a lost love, were all that kept him pressing on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the breathtaking spectacle of a thousand burning suns never ceased to amaze.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was fraught with peril—uncharted space, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction—but the promise of discovering a new civilization, and perhaps even making contact with long-lost relatives, fueled her unwavering resolve.
