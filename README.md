
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like the teeth of some slumbering beast.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of her perilous journey, a constant reminder of the unforgiving landscape and the desperate stakes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to a rumored habitable planet beyond the known galaxies.  Her crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, scanned the cosmos for potential threats – pirate vessels or unpredictable spatial anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to Elara’s mountain pass, held its own terrors,  a silent threat amplified by the hum of the ship’s engines and the weight of their potentially epochal discovery.
