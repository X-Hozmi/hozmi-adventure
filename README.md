Her journey across the treacherous highlands to reach the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the whispers of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, a relentless flame in the heart of a seasoned traveler.
