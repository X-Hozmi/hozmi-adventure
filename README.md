
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the grueling rhythm of travel – the creak of saddle leather, the sting of windburn, the constant threat of bandits lurking in shadowed forests.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to navigate, a new risk to overcome, forging her spirit stronger with every league she covered.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time, yet the vastness of space held its own terrors.  Unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels were constant companions.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Ryla's challenges were cosmic, but the thrill of discovery, the push to explore the unknown, burned with the same fierce intensity.
