
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried meat and water; it holds the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the chilling whispers of the plague follow close behind. Yet, the lure of a better life propels her forward, fueled by grit and a stubborn hope that burns brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in months of hyperspace travel, is fraught with peril: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped galaxies and establishing a new human frontier, outweighs the risks, a thrilling gamble for a future beyond the stars.
