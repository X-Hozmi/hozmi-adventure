
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising riches in the distant lands of the East.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling unknown that stretched before her, a vast tapestry woven with both peril and the intoxicating allure of adventure.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance and will, but the whispers of legendary cities and untold treasures spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The shimmering expanse of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, masked the inherent dangers of asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  Navigating this cosmic ocean demanded unwavering skill and courage, but the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the universe – made every risk worthwhile.  The vastness of space, though terrifying, was ultimately her playground.
