
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving far more arduous than the worn map promised.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages. Yet, with each sunrise, Thomas pressed on, driven by faith and a thirst for the unknown, his journey a tapestry woven with breathtaking vistas, perilous encounters, and the unwavering camaraderie of fellow travelers bound for the same distant shrine.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding survivors amidst the cosmic vastness, fueled her relentless pursuit across the galaxy, a journey as much about human resilience as the exploration of uncharted star systems.
