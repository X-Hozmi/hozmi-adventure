
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle for survival, each sunset a precarious victory against the elements and the unknown dangers lurking in the shadows.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a rogue wormhole decades prior.  Hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirate attacks were the challenges facing Elara and her crew as they charted a course through the unmapped reaches of the galaxy.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also held the promise of unimaginable peril at every turn.
