
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn map, barely legible after weeks of relentless travel, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient knowledge.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of untold riches and magical artifacts, spurred her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each labored breath of her horse, was a testament to her unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across lightyears of unimaginable distance.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a counterpoint to the thrill of exploring uncharted galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying world.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien species, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – the spirit of adventure, the burning desire to push the boundaries of the known, remained as potent as it had been in Elara's time.
