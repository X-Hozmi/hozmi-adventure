
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the summer heat, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  He was bound for the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine haunted every mile, yet the lure of the unknown propelled him forward, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and the possibility of glory.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vast nebula of Cygnus X-1 shimmering on her viewport.  Her mission: to navigate the treacherous gravitational currents surrounding a newly discovered black hole, a risky shortcut to the Xylos system.  The stakes were high – a lucrative shipment of rare Xylan crystals – but the true adventure lay in the exploration of uncharted space, the possibility of encountering alien life, and the ever-present danger of unforeseen cosmic phenomena threatening to swallow her ship whole.
