
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of the journey, but the unwavering hope of salvation pushed him ever closer to his unknown destination.  The clang of his armor, the rhythmic thud of hooves, and the endless horizon were his only companions in this vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying world.  Warp jumps sent them hurtling through the fabric of spacetime, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and hostile alien encounters. The vast emptiness of space was a constant, palpable presence, both terrifying and exhilarating, as Eva charted a course through uncharted territories, her crew's lives and the fate of her people hanging in the balance.
