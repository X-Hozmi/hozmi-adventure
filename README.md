
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was far from the romanticized tales of knights and chivalry; it was a grueling test of endurance, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, from the whispering shadows of ancient forests to the harsh judgements of unforgiving townsfolk.  Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck of defiance against the boundless expanse.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet each jump remained a gamble, a leap of faith across the cosmic ocean.  Pirates, rogue corporations, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies were constant companions on her quest for the legendary Xylos artifact, a device said to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a lonely and unforgiving mistress, demanding courage, skill, and an unyielding spirit to survive.
