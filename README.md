
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pushes onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, the roads are treacherous, and disease stalks the land. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fuels his weary steps.  He dreams of the cathedral's grandeur, a beacon of hope in a world of hardship and uncertainty, a worthy reward for his arduous overland adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes pilots the starship 'Stardust' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering uncharted nebulae, Elara and her crew face dangers far beyond the medieval traveler's imagination.  Yet, the allure of new beginnings, of a chance at survival, propels them forward through the star-strewn void, a testament to humanity's enduring spirit of exploration.
