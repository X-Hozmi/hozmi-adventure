
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the sun glinting off her worn chainmail.  Ahead stretches the vast, untamed wilderness separating her homeland from the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold ancient magic.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that accompanies weeks spent traversing unknown lands. But the thrill of discovery, the hope of finding Eldoria, fuels her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden temporal anomaly.  Navigation charts are useless in this chaotic region of spacetime; Eva relies on instinct and the cryptic readings of her ancient navigational array.  The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, is a constant reminder of the immense risks she takes, but the potential reward – finding the lost colonists – makes the perilous journey worth the gamble.
