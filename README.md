
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, undulating plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Robbers, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of bandits punctuated her journey, each sunrise bringing fresh challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of whether she'd reach her destination in time.  The weight of her brother's life, and the perilous beauty of the unknown, spurred her relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfire" Jax navigated the nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially dangerous lifeforms.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyage.  But the lure of discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories in the vastness of space, fueled her drive, a thirst for adventure echoing the spirit of medieval travelers across the ages.
