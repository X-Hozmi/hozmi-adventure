
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains of France as Jean, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's writ, a promise of gold and glory, burned in his saddlebag, a stark contrast to the gnawing hunger in his belly.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the long grass held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the slow, agonizing death of starvation or disease.  His journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, was a tapestry woven with the threads of hope and fear, sweat and dust.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting her ship in an eerie glow.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a black hole, a task as dangerous as it was lucrative.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the clutches of space pirates, and battling the crushing gravity of the black hole were all in a day’s work. The vast, unforgiving expanse of space, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic wonders and deadly hazards, offered a different kind of adventure, one measured in light years, not leagues.
