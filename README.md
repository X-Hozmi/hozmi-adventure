
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel, containing nothing but a chipped compass, a dried loaf of bread, and a tattered map, felt heavier with each mile.  Rumors of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and guarded by ancient magic, spurred her onward.  Robbers, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation were minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown, a siren song whispering promises of untold riches and glory across the endless landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the ever-present dangers of space pirates, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling void itself.  Unlike Elara's journey, his was aided by advanced technology, but the thrill of exploration, the intoxicating gamble against the vast unknown, remained a timeless human constant.
