
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before her.  Her small band of travelers, a motley crew of mercenaries and pilgrims, pressed onward, their faces grim under the relentless sun.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need for escape, tested their limits, forging bonds of unlikely camaraderie amidst hardship and fear.  The whispered legends of mythical beasts and enchanted lands only added to the thrill, and the daunting unknown beckoned them further.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse collection of xeno-biologists and explorers, charted unmapped galaxies, their sensors constantly scanning for habitable planets and undiscovered wonders.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space held its own unique terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  Their mission, a quest to locate a legendary lost colony, pushed them to the edge of known space, a thrilling expedition into the breathtaking, and potentially deadly, unknown.
