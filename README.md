
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their resilience.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating by the stars to bartering for meager rations in isolated villages.  Their adventure was less a quest for glory and more a grueling test of survival, a testament to human endurance in the face of a unforgiving world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating through uncharted star systems, dodging asteroid fields and the occasional rogue pirate vessel, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond those of the medieval era.  Warp drives hummed, advanced sensors scanned for signs of life, and the vast, unknowable expanse of space pressed in on them, a thrilling and terrifying backdrop to their intergalactic rescue operation.
