
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting wind.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of a notorious brigand lord.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of this untamed land. Every village offered a fleeting glimpse of hope, a chance for rest and meager provisions, before plunging back into the unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets tested her skills to their limits, a constant battle against the unforgiving void.  The promise of discovery, however, fueled her determination, driving her and her crew towards the unknown frontiers of the galaxy.
