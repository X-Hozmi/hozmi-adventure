
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and treacherous passes tested both her courage and her endurance. Each day brought new challenges—a raging river to ford, a blizzard to weather, the suspicious glares of villagers clinging to ancient superstitions.  Yet, with every sunrise, her determination burned brighter than the morning star.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Petrova piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking cosmic display.  The mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the fringes of explored space, light-years from Earth. Hyperspace jumps were fraught with risk, pirates lurked in the shadows of uncharted systems, and the ever-present threat of unknown anomalies kept her crew on edge.  But the chance to save lives, to push the boundaries of human exploration, fueled her unwavering commitment to reach her destination, a beacon of hope against the vast, unknowable darkness.
