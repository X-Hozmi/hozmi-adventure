
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plains stretching before her.  Her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience and faith, but the glint of the distant city, a beacon of hope, kept her moving forward.  The adventure was harsh, brutal, but undeniably exhilarating.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  Unlike the medieval adventurer, Eva faced dangers of a different kind: volatile stellar phenomena, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the potential for groundbreaking scientific breakthroughs fueled her relentless pursuit across the vast emptiness of space.
