The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear. He was bound for the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold forgotten magic and untold riches, a journey fraught with brigands, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.

Her destination: Xylos, a planet said to harbor a source of energy capable of powering the entire Sol Federation.

But the glittering promise of Xylos, and the weight of her crew's survival, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
