
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested her strength daily, and whispers of a plague sweeping across Europe haunted her dreams.  Yet, the allure of the sacred city, the camaraderie found in shared hardship with fellow travelers, and the sheer thrill of traversing unknown lands fueled her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda Galaxy, her destination a newly discovered planet teeming with unknown life.  The hyperdrive hummed, a lullaby against the vast, star-dusted expanse.  While dangers were different –  uncharted nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the potential for hostile alien encounters – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The unmapped territories, the mysteries to be unraveled, and the promise of discovery were a siren's call, drawing Eva and her crew towards the edge of known space and into the heart of the unknown.
