
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest held the promise of a legendary lost city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers and wonders that lay ahead in this unforgiving landscape. Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small price to pay for the glory of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, hard steel of his starship.  His mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a galaxy previously unknown to humanity.  The vastness of space, the potential for alien encounters both wondrous and terrifying, the sheer technological marvel of interstellar travel – it all fueled his insatiable thirst for exploration.  The risk of encountering hostile lifeforms or system malfunctions was a constant companion, but the allure of the unknown outweighed any fear.
