
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling markets of Prague he'd left behind.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the clutches of the Black Hand, a shadowy order rumored to dwell in the forbidding Carpathian Mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit or beast, turning every mile into a desperate gamble against the elements and unknown dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were daily hazards, a far cry from the carefully plotted courses of her training simulations.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, pressed in on her as she wrestled with the ship's controls, her mission to secure vital resources for a starving Earth hanging precariously in the balance.
