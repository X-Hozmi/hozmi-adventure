Sir Kaelan, his surcoat dusty and his sword heavy at his hip, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of travel had brought him and his small band closer to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

The risks: encountering unpredictable gravitational fields, hostile alien species, and the ever-present danger of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving emptiness of space.  The reward, however, was worth the gamble.
