
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, felt less holy and more harrowing with each passing day.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests,  villages offered meager hospitality, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavier than the damp air. Yet, the promise of spiritual redemption, and the thrill of traversing unknown lands, spurred him onward, each sunrise painting a new, uncertain chapter in his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, her journey was a dance with the very fabric of space-time.  The breathtaking vistas of alien planets, the silent majesty of dying stars, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive engine provided a stark contrast to the perils of interstellar travel, but the allure of discovery – and the weight of her crew's lives – made every risk worthwhile.
