
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of weary camels and sweating horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Persia.  The air shimmers with heat, punctuated only by the cries of hawks circling overhead and the rhythmic clang of our escort's armor.  Each sunrise brings the promise of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the lure of the legendary city of Samarkand, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, propels us onward. The vast, unknown desert stretches before us, a perilous but thrilling path to untold fortunes and adventure.

Alternatively, in 2742, the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship bristling with advanced weaponry and shimmering with newly-mined nebula dust, jumps to hyperspace.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across entire galaxies.  The journey itself is a gamble; unpredictable wormholes and hostile pirate factions plague the intergalactic lanes. But the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the universe – makes the risk worthwhile. We are pioneers, charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
