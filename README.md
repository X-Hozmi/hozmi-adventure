Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a test of her resilience, and the hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, despite the hardships and uncertainties that littered her path.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years across the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unforgiving vacuum of space were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos, both breathtaking and terrifying, tested his skills and courage as he pushed the limits of human exploration, venturing where few had dared to go before.
