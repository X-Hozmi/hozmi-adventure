
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled in the Pyrenees, said to hold the secret to curing her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred her on, a flickering candle against the vast, uncertain night.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's swirling colors.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet teeming with a new form of energy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace held a sliver of dread – would they emerge in a habitable system, or be lost forever amongst the cold, uncaring vastness of the cosmos?  The galaxy beckoned, both beautiful and terrifying in its infinite possibilities.
