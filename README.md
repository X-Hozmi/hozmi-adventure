
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his resilience, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the vast, unforgiving landscape.  He travelled with a small band of misfits, bound together by a shared yearning for adventure and a desperate hope for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, peppered with rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational fields, presented its own unique brand of peril.  Her crew, a diverse group of scientists and explorers, faced the challenges of interstellar travel with a mix of excitement and apprehension.  The potential rewards – the discovery of new life, the expansion of human knowledge – were worth the risks, fueling their daring journey across the cosmic ocean.
