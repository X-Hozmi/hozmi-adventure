His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the King's mortal illness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the perils he faced as he traversed the vast, untamed landscape, his loyal squire, Thomas, ever at his side, their hope as unwavering as their determination. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed commitment to their perilous journey.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and potentially lethal alien lifeforms.  Warp jumps across light-years of space, navigating asteroid fields, and outsmarting ruthless space pirates were just some of the obstacles she and her crew confronted. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held them captive in its majestic embrace as they raced against time and the ever-present threat of interstellar conflict.
