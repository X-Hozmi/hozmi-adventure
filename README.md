
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged along the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her worn satchel held little more than dried meat, a waterskin, and a worn map promising riches in the distant kingdom of Eldoria.  Each creak of the ancient forest, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of magic said to linger in these forgotten lands fueled her both with fear and a fierce determination.  This journey, fraught with peril, was her only chance at escaping a life of servitude.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy had been fraught with its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Ryla, hardened by years of spacefaring, felt only the thrill of the chase, the lure of the unknown fueling her resolve.  The fate of humanity, perhaps, rested on her shoulders and the reliability of her aging hyperdrive.
