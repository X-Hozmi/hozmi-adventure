
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He shared meager rations with his companions, a grizzled veteran and a young, eager squire, their camaraderie forged in the crucible of shared hardship and the unwavering pursuit of their dream. The endless expanse of land stretching before them, a tapestry woven with peril and promise, was their arena.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and contending with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were everyday occurrences.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers united by a thirst for discovery, monitored sensors, charting new star systems and encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and dangerous. The vastness of space, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders and unimaginable threats, was their boundless frontier.
