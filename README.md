
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing properties.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or the relentless march of the plague itself.  Yet, the unwavering gaze fixed on the distant, hazy silhouette of the mountains fueled her onward, a testament to the human spirit's indomitable will to survive.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, presented a different kind of danger.  Asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena tested the limits of her crew's skill and courage. Yet, the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding new life, propelled them further into the inky black, a testament to humanity's insatiable curiosity and relentless pursuit of the unknown.
