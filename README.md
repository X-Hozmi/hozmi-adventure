
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery for healing herbs. Each creaking step of her mount, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering glint in her eyes reflected not fear, but the fierce determination to overcome these challenges and reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace. The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was punctuated by navigational hazards – asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on unsuspecting travelers.  But for Razor, the vast expanse of space held not just peril, but the thrill of discovery and the hope of securing a better future for humanity.
