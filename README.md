
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, propelled her forward, each hardship only strengthening her resolve.

Centuries later,  Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a humbling and terrifying expanse, held far more unknowns than the medieval steppes.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear his vessel apart, derelict spaceships lay scattered like skeletal remains across the star fields, and the constant threat of pirate raids kept his crew on high alert.  But the hope of finding a new home for humanity, a new Eden among the stars, was a beacon guiding him through the endless night.
