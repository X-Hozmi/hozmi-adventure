
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of a land unforgiving to the unprepared.  His meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Zerzura, pushed him relentlessly forward.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'. The jump coordinates were precarious, a gamble even for a seasoned pilot like her.  Beyond the nebula lay the Xylos cluster, a collection of planets rumored to harbor the mythical Xylan crystals – the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space. But the potential rewards, the advancement of interstellar travel, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course into the uncharted realms of the cosmos.
