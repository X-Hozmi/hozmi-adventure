
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a worn map.  Each creaking step brought her closer to the fabled monastery rumored to hold the secret to curing the plague ravaging her village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the hope of salvation fueled her onward, each sunrise painting a new vista of breathtaking, and terrifying, beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of nebulae, hurtling towards the Xylos system.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the volatile planet Xylos Prime.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and facing the unknown alien ecosystems of distant worlds were all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew.  The vast, glittering canvas of the cosmos offered breathtaking views, but held the chilling promise of danger around every unexplored star.
