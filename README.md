
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of Zerzura, spurred him ever forward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent majesty of dying stars and the vibrant hues of alien nebulae, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Every jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering unforeseen dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, or the insidious decay of the ship's aging systems.  Yet, the hope of finding a new home for her people fueled her determination, a tiny spark of defiance against the infinite darkness.
