
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the whispered stories of Zerzura's wonders fueled her weary legs and determined spirit. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in her perilous journey across a vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and contending with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her undertaking and the potential rewards of her interstellar voyage.
