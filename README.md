
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a silent testament to the journey ahead.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – precious heirloom varieties destined for a monastery nestled deep within the valley.  Bandits, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, yet the thought of providing sustenance for the winter fuels her onward. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new vista, a fresh reminder of the resilience of the human spirit against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive a comforting counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and unimaginable cosmic distances.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remains the same.  The thrill of exploration, the camaraderie forged in the face of adversity, and the promise of discovery bind the crew together as they push the boundaries of known space.
