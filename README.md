
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of  oxen, horses, and weary travelers, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as we navigated treacherous mountain passes and skirted bandit-infested forests, our goal: the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each day brought new challenges –  fording raging rivers, bartering with suspicious villagers, and constantly vigilant against the ever-present threat of raiders. The air vibrated with the unspoken promise of both peril and untold riches.

Centuries later, the *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy fields, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her crew across the cosmic tapestry, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and charting unknown nebulae.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The silence of space was punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the crackle of subspace communications, a stark contrast to the bustling caravan of old, yet the thrill of exploration, the yearning for the unknown, burned just as brightly.
