
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps, past snow-capped peaks and treacherous mountain passes.  We sought the lost city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, a legend fueling our weary steps through bandit-infested forests and sun-baked plains. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – ravenous wolves, warring factions, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled us onward, fueled by hope and a shared thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Our mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a settlement that vanished centuries ago, swallowed by the vastness of space.  Hyperspace jumps are risky, each one a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or rogue asteroids.  Alien life, both wondrous and hostile, lurks in the shadows of uncharted systems.  But the potential discovery of a lost civilization, a forgotten people, is a reward worth the immense risk and the lonely expanse of interstellar travel.
