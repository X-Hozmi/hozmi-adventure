
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their mission: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the lost secrets of King Arthur.  Each creak of their saddle leather, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, held the promise of both breathtaking discovery and mortal danger. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease dogged their steps, but the lure of the unknown spurred them onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the anxieties of the crew; navigating asteroid fields, contending with temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were all part of the interstellar journey. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds, and expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy ignited a fire within them, driving them towards the unknown depths of space.
