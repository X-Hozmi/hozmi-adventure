
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the unwavering hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey, but the lure of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been fraught with unpredictable solar flares, but the potential discovery of sentient life outweighed the risks.  Jax gazed at the swirling colours of the nebula, a breathtaking spectacle only space travel could provide.  His mission: to forge first contact, a task as perilous and exciting as any medieval quest, but with the added spice of wormholes and alien landscapes.
