
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or fantastical encounter, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where the journey itself was as perilous as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey for habitable planets, a far cry from the muddy tracks of Sir Kaelan's era.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the ethereal beauty of distant galaxies and the menacing shadow of asteroid fields, presented a different kind of peril; a technological one, relying on the precise calculations of her AI and the unwavering courage of her crew, facing threats unseen by any medieval knight.
