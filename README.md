
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her loyal hound, Jasper, panting at her heels.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic, has been arduous.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger have tested their resolve, but the shimmering mirage on the horizon fuels their hope.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of endurance in this vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the light of a binary sunset.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless nebulae.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of distant suns is a constant dance between precision and daring.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, holds dangers far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, yet the thrill of exploration burns just as brightly in her heart.
