
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumours of a hidden city, shimmering with untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled her perilous journey.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the endless expanse of wilderness tested her resilience at every turn.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the lure of the unknown spurred her onward.  

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly years ago.  Warp drives hummed, jumping her across light-years, dodging asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, presented a different kind of hardship than Elara’s, one of isolation and the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown, possibly hostile, denizens of the galaxy.
