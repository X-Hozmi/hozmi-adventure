
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, pushed him through blighted forests haunted by brigands and across sun-baked plains where mirages danced like cruel illusions.  Each sunrise brought new perils: treacherous mountain passes, the threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of encountering hostile lords and their armies.  Yet, the whisper of Zerzura's magic fueled his onward journey.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while the ever-present threat of pirate raids demanded constant vigilance.  But Eva, driven by hope and the promise of rediscovering humanity's lost kin, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the shimmering, distant star that held the key to the colony's fate.
