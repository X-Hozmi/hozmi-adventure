
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets – secrets that might save her ailing village.  Each day is a gamble, fraught with the perils of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope in her eyes burns brighter than the setting sun, fueling her onward journey across this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast distances are measured not in miles, but in light-years, and every jump through hyperspace carries a risk of encountering unforeseen cosmic anomalies or rival explorers.  Yet, the weight of her responsibility, the yearning to discover life beyond Earth, drives her and her crew across the uncharted expanse, towards the boundless promise of the cosmos.
