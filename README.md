
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the parched earth, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her meager pack held only essential supplies – dried meat, a waterskin nearly empty, and a well-worn map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the tension of her solitary journey, a constant reminder of the wild and unpredictable nature of the medieval world.  Robbers, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of deep space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, indifferent emptiness.  Unlike Elara, Ryla's journey wasn't driven by desperation, but by the relentless human thirst for discovery. Yet, the challenges were no less formidable; navigating asteroid fields, dealing with unpredictable wormhole activity, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien civilizations presented perils as significant as any medieval traveler could face.
