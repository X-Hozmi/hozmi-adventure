
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with encounters – skirmishes with bandits, the hospitality of wary villagers, the breathtaking beauty of unspoiled forests.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve, the distant spires of Eldoria a shimmering beacon in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a desperate search for the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes that threatened to tear her ship apart, Eva relied on her crew’s skill and the ancient navigational charts whispered to be of extra-galactic origin.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both immense peril and the tantalizing possibility of discovery, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the uncaring indifference of the cosmos.
