
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's caravan lumbered across the sun-baked plains, the creak of wagon wheels a mournful counterpoint to the chirping of cicadas.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches, had already claimed a toll – a lost mule, a bout of dysentery, and the ever-present fear of bandits.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of adventure beyond the familiar, spurred them onward, each sunrise a renewed gamble against the harsh realities of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Corvus piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and establish a trade route with the enigmatic Zydonian civilization.  The vastness of space, peppered with shimmering dust clouds and the distant gleam of uncharted planets, offered a different kind of danger – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the thrill of exploration, the chance to add his name to the annals of galactic history, outweighed every risk.
