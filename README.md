His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude from the clutches of the Black Hand, a notorious bandit group rumored to operate in the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each day brought new perils – bandits, treacherous terrain, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild animals. Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, and the promise of glory spurred him onward.

Conversely, in 2742, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that had vanished near the edge of known space.

The unknown, in this future age, beckoned with the promise of new worlds and incredible discoveries, testing the limits of human ingenuity and resilience.
