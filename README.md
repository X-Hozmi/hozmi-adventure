Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her family's hopes, felt like a second skin.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whisper of the distant port city, and the chance at a new life, propelled her onward, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal engine of the *Stardust Wanderer* humming a low thrum against the backdrop of silent stars.  His mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would span generations.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders and the lurking threat of uncharted asteroid fields, presented a different kind of hardship.  But the allure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries beyond the known, fuelled his crew’s tireless exploration across the cosmic ocean.
