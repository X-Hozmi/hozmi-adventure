
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our roughspun clothes. Ahead lies a perilous trek across the Pyrenees Mountains, then through the sun-baked plains of Castilla, dodging bandits and navigating treacherous passes.  Our destination: the legendary city of Baghdad, a jewel of the East rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. We travel by foot, relying on the kindness of strangers and the strength of our loyal pack animals, each sunrise bringing the promise of new challenges and unforeseen adventures.  

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive, a symphony of controlled chaos as we jump between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, an Earth-like planet orbiting a red dwarf star millions of light years from Earth.  We're pioneers, charting unmapped territories among nebulae and asteroid fields, facing the unpredictable hazards of space travel – from rogue black holes to hostile alien life forms.  The vastness of space is daunting, but the potential discoveries, the sheer thrill of exploring the unknown, outweigh the risks a thousandfold.
