
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his frame, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll – the relentless sun bleaching his hair, the dust clogging his throat.  His small band, battered but resolute, pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up clouds of ochre dust on the parched earth.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis promising untold riches and a respite from the endless, unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of saddle leather and the rhythmic beat of their horses' hooves was a drumbeat against the silence of the vast, unknown expanse.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter,' its sleek hull a testament to humanity's reach across the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f was imminent, a risky hyperspace transit across light years of uncharted nebulae.  The vibrant, swirling colors of the nebula outside her viewport pulsed with a terrifying beauty.  Eva's mission: to establish contact with the Keplerians and secure a vital resource for a dying Earth.  The weight of humanity's future, and the vastness of space itself, pressed down on her as she prepared for the jump, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the galaxy.
