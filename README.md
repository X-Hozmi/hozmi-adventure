
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion to her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant shadows, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the known world, fueled her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship *Stardust Drifter* leaped across the void, its hyperdrive spitting them into the Orion Arm.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a world rumored to harbor sentient life.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, the vast, inky blackness of space a stark contrast to the vibrant nebulae they traversed.  The unknown wasn't just geographical; it was biological, technological, even philosophical. The journey promised not just discovery, but a confrontation with the very nature of existence itself.
