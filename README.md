
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and a chipped waterskin; it contained a cryptic map promising untold riches hidden within a forgotten monastery.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the perilous journey, but the allure of adventure, the whisper of the unknown, fueled her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, was a potential story waiting to unfold.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope flickering faintly on the edge of known space.  Wormholes, asteroid fields, and hostile alien encounters were commonplace hazards, but the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new life and new worlds, was a siren call she couldn't resist.  The cosmos, a limitless expanse of wonder and danger, lay before her.
