
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the tattered map promising a legendary lost city hidden amongst the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend, but the whispered tales of unimaginable riches fueled her weary legs. This journey, fraught with peril, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source on the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  The hyperdrive hummed a constant, low thrum against the ship's silence, broken only by the crackle of comms and the soft whirring of the life support systems.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless dangers: asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  But the potential rewards, for her crew and for humanity, outweighed the considerable risks.
