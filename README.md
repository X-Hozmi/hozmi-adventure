
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes onward, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the gnawing fear of the uncharted forest are constant companions on her journey from the ravaged fields of Normandy to the rumored haven of the southern coast.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the hope of a new life, a life free from the plague and endless war, fuels her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx strides across the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vast panorama of the Andromeda Galaxy spread before him.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a journey spanning light-years and treacherous nebulae.  Navigating hyperspace currents and evading pirate fleets are daily challenges, the weight of his crew's survival resting on his shoulders. The allure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration in a cosmos teeming with wonder and peril, outweighs the inherent risks of this interstellar odyssey.
