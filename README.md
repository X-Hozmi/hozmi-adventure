
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies, chafed her shoulders, a constant reminder of the long, arduous journey ahead.  Each creak of her saddlebag was a whispered prayer for safe passage through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Her quest, to find the legendary lost city of Ys, fuelled her onward, a flickering ember against the vast darkness of the unknown.  The whisper of wind through the tall grasses felt like ancient secrets, urging her towards her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Galaxies spun like celestial fireworks around her, each a potential destination, each a promise of untold wonders and unimaginable dangers.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate, dwindling human colony.  The vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a lonely counterpoint to the hum of the ship's engines and the constant chatter of her AI co-pilot.  Each jump across the void was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the universe.
