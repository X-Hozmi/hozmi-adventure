
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Jude, was far from the romanticized tales sung in taverns.  Days bled into weeks, marked by muddy tracks, the constant threat of bandits, and nights spent huddled around meager fires under a vast, indifferent sky. Each sunrise brought the promise of more hardship, but also the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, of pushing against the limits of their endurance and charting their own course across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a neutron star.  The journey across galaxies, though swift compared to Gareth's, held its own dangers.  Cosmic radiation threatened their shields, uncharted asteroid fields posed constant collisions, and the eerie silence of space, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines, gnawed at the crew's nerves.  Yet, the awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos and the thrill of exploration fueled their determination to reach their destination and return with the knowledge they sought.
