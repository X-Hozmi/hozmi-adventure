
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled in the Carpathian Mountains, a sanctuary said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the plague itself, which stalked the land like a ravenous beast.  She carried only a worn map, a few meager coins, and the unwavering hope that fueled her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfall" Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: a daring expedition to the newly discovered Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  The vastness of space, speckled with shimmering nebulae and menacing asteroid fields, was a constant threat.  Alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, were a daily risk, as was the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovering new civilizations and unlocking the universe's secrets, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the celestial ocean.
