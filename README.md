
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Breton countryside was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable spring rains, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each creaking mile, Elara’s resolve hardened.  She carried a precious map, promising untold riches and a chance to escape the poverty of her village, a gamble worth the risks of this medieval odyssey.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were but minor inconveniences compared to the vast unknown.  The thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, fueled her drive across the galactic expanse.
