
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast distance still to cover.  But the lure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by the swirling chaos of a dying star.  Faster-than-light travel was a double-edged sword, warping space and time in unpredictable ways, and the risks of encountering unknown celestial phenomena were ever-present. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of a vanished civilization, spurred her on through the perilous cosmic currents.
