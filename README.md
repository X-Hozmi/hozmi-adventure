
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast, unforgiving desert.  Bandits, scorching sun, and dwindling supplies were constant companions, but the whispered tales of Zerzura's lost treasures – and the chance to escape her arranged marriage – fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a gnawing uncertainty, yet the thrill of the unknown kept her determined heart beating strong.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Kryll ships was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of intergalactic permits and the ever-present threat of pirates. But the promise of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, of charting unknown galaxies, outweighed any risk.  The vast emptiness of space held both terror and wonder, a captivating blend driving her and her crew further into the unknown.
