
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of her journey.  She carried a secret scroll, a map promising untold riches hidden within a forgotten monastery, a treasure guarded by perilous mountain passes and rumored brigands.  Her only companions were a loyal but aging hound and a gnawing hunger, fueling her determination to reach her destination before winter’s icy grip claimed the high passes.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be teeming with both incredible resources and equally deadly alien lifeforms.  Warp jumps strained the ship’s aging engines, each a gamble against catastrophic system failure.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered little comfort, but the thrill of discovery, the promise of galactic renown, pushed him ever onward, a lone explorer charting the unmapped edges of the known universe.
