
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary oxen onward, the setting sun painting the bleak landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the ravaged countryside to reach the rumored haven of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, and famine stalked the land. Each creak of the cart wheels, each rustle in the dry grass, sent a shiver of apprehension down her spine, fueling the desperate hope that Eldoria was more than just a legend whispered on the wind.  The adventure was arduous, the rewards uncertain, but the need to escape her past propelled her forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of securing hyperspace permits and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, each jump to lightspeed a gamble, each new planet a potential paradise or deadly trap. But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, pressed on, fueled by the hope of finding her missing sister and uncovering the secrets of Aethel's disappearance.
