
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey across the Kingdom of Francia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meagre sustenance in isolated villages.  His quest, to find a legendary lost monastery rumored to hold ancient knowledge, pushed him ever onward, fueled by a mixture of hope and sheer stubbornness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  Instead of bandits, she faced the unpredictable hazards of hyperspace jumps, the ever-present threat of pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the terrifying unknown that lurked in unexplored sectors of the galaxy.  Each jump was a gamble, each encounter a fight for survival. Yet, driven by the faint hope of finding survivors, and the irresistible allure of the cosmos, Elara pushed her ship and herself to the limits of endurance.
