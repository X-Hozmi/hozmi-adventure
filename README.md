
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his squire Thomas, and three grizzled mercenaries trudged through the mud, their horses’ hooves sinking with each labored step.  Their journey across the treacherous Black Forest was fraught with peril – not just from the unpredictable terrain and looming nightfall, but also from whispers of brigands and the ever-present threat of wild wolves.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for a deadly encounter, sharpening their senses and testing their resolve as they pressed on towards the distant, rumored city of Eldoria.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with a different kind of fear.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits.  Ahead lay the unknown – a planet potentially teeming with life, both friendly and hostile.  Eva checked her sensors, a grim determination etched on her face. The vast emptiness of space offered no safe haven; every star system was a gamble, every alien civilization a potential ally or enemy in her quest to locate the lost colony of New Eden.
