
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy City of Jerusalem, had already tested their resilience.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had become familiar companions.  Yet, the allure of the far-off city, a beacon of faith and legend, spurred them on, each sunrise painting a new chapter in their perilous adventure across a vast and unforgiving landscape.  The clink of Kaelan's spurs against the stony ground was the soundtrack to their arduous but thrilling quest.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, stars blurred into streaks of incandescent light, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her.  Each jump between star systems was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the risk of encountering hostile space pirates or navigating treacherous asteroid fields. But the promise of discovery, of finding those lost colonists, fueled her determination as she navigated the cosmic expanse, an adventurer in a realm far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval pilgrims.
