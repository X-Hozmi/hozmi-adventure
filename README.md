
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, but each sunset the gnawing fear of failure, starvation, or worse.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and stunning beauty, a testament to the unwavering human spirit in the face of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant cosmic canvas of unimaginable scale.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate mining planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates, Eva's journey was a perilous ballet of precision and daring.  While lacking the immediate physical hardships of Kaelan's trek, the vastness of space presented a different kind of isolation and a constant battle against the unpredictable forces of the universe.
