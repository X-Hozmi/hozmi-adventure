
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted with a vital message for the King.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land.  Her journey was a perilous dance between survival and hope, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval travelers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across lightyears to the distant galaxy of Andromeda.   The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vista of celestial bodies and cosmic wonders visible through her viewport.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony and establish contact, a journey fraught with the risks of uncharted space, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  The vastness of the cosmos mirrored the courage required to traverse it.
