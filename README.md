
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a shimmering jewel in tales whispered around crackling fires.  Her journey had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  But the promise of Eldoria, a city said to hold ancient magic and untold riches, spurred her onward, each step a testament to her unwavering courage and adventurous spirit.  The map, a tattered piece of parchment clutched in her hand, was her only guide through the untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, charting a course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies – hazards far removed from the dangers Elara had faced, but equally deadly.  Eva’s mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. The vastness of space, the cold indifference of the cosmos, represented a different kind of wilderness, but the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, burned just as brightly in Eva's heart as it had in Elara's.
