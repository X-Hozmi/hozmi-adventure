
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a few coins, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets beyond imagining, guarded by treacherous mountain passes and wilder folk.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a thrill of both fear and exhilarating anticipation through her, a constant reminder that survival, and the discovery of Eldoria, depended entirely on her courage and cunning.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Valiant stood on the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, the vast spiral galaxy of Xylos shimmering outside the viewport.  His mission: to navigate the treacherous Xylos Nebula and reach the uncharted planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive thrummed through the ship, a counterpoint to the silent tension in the air.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable peril.  The fate of humanity, perhaps even the galaxy, rested on this single, perilous journey.
