
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Black Forest, shadows lengthening as twilight approached.  He carried a king's ransom in silver, a desperate plea scrawled on parchment, and the weight of a vow sworn over a dying man's bed.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in this untamed land, but the lure of the distant city of Prague, and the hope it held, propelled him ever forward.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the Xylos Nebula aboard the 'Stardust Wanderer'.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive resonated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the infinite blackness peppered with the distant, glittering pinpricks of stars.  Though technologically advanced, the dangers were no less real; rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders prowling the void, each a testament to the perilous nature of interstellar travel.
