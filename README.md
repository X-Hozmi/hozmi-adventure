Sir Alistair adjusted his cloak against the biting wind, his gaze fixed on the horizon.  He clutched the worn map in his hand, its edges frayed with use, a guide to the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to be hidden deep within the whispering forests.

The journey was fraught with danger, with rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes lurking around every corner.  But Anya knew the risks.  She had to reach Kepler-452b, for the sake of humanity, for the sake of a future that could not be lost.
