
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present shadow of the plague.  Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheels and every distant minaret sighted, a thrill courses through us – the exhilarating risk of the unknown, the promise of distant markets and untold riches, fuels our weary steps towards the fabled city of Samarkand.


Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The sleek, chrome hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cuts through the inky blackness, hurtling towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling solar flares is commonplace; the true adventure lies in the discovery of alien civilizations, the uncharted nebulae brimming with wonders beyond human comprehension, and the sheer audacity of pushing humanity's boundaries across the cosmic ocean.  The risks are immense –  a single malfunction could mean oblivion – but the reward, the boundless potential of the universe, eclipses all fear.
