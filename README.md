
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, urged his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely a path across the windswept plains of Aquitaine, stretched before them, leading towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous quest, a journey fueled by whispered legends of untold riches and a lost artifact of immense power.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and combating the hostile alien lifeforms indigenous to Kepler-186f were all in a day's work for Elara and her seasoned crew.  The galaxy was their battlefield, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge their guiding star.
