
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin heavy with the weight of the summer heat and the even heavier burden of her quest.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Jude, had driven her from her village, a perilous journey across treacherous mountain passes and lawless territories. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, yet the whisper of ancient knowledge spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas clouds a stark contrast to the cold, hard steel of his starship.  His mission: to locate a lost colony ship rumored to have discovered a new source of energy within a previously uncharted galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the debilitating effects of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work for Razor, but the lure of unimaginable power, and the possibility of rewriting galactic history, propelled him further into the cosmic unknown.
