
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under a bruised sky, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across swirling rivers, and into the shadowed heart of the Whispering Woods, where goblin raids were a constant threat. Each dawn brought new peril: bandits lurking in the ruins of forgotten castles, the gnawing hunger of the unforgiving landscape, and the ever-present fear of the unknown that lay beyond the next crest. Yet, the lure of Ys, a city whispered to hold unimaginable power and forgotten secrets, fueled their relentless march.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of warp engines, the crackle of subspace communications, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks – spacefaring raiders who preyed on lone vessels venturing far from established trade routes. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted void, the success of which hinged on precise calculations and a dash of luck. Yet, the promise of new life, new worlds, and the chance to rewrite humanity's destiny, was a siren song too alluring to resist.
