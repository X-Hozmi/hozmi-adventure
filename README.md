
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her and her mule.  Ahead lay the vast, untamed expanse of the Ardennes forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and wilder beasts.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery at Saint-Denis, carrying a vital message that could save her village from a devastating famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for excitement, danger, and the unexpected discovery of hidden paths and forgotten settlements.  The journey, though perilous, held a thrilling promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of space pirates, Eva relied on her wits, her trusty crew, and the cutting-edge technology of her ship.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking vistas of nebulae and distant galaxies, but the journey was fraught with the constant hum of potential disaster; a broken warp drive or a surprise attack could spell the end of their mission, and perhaps, their lives.
