
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating by the stars to bartering for supplies in unfamiliar, sometimes hostile, villages.  The adventure was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a distant neutron star, a journey spanning lightyears across the vast emptiness of space.  While lacking the immediate physical threats of Reginald's era, Eva faced dangers equally perilous: malfunctioning warp drives, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions preying on interstellar traffic. The thrill of exploration, however, burned as bright as any earthly sun, driving her across the cosmos.
