
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the promise of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, fueled her onward.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with fear, camaraderie, and the unwavering hope of uncovering ancient secrets.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps were risky, the void between stars a terrifying expanse filled with unknown celestial anomalies and the ever-present danger of pirate raiders.  Yet, the weight of her responsibility, the hope of rescuing countless lives, spurred her on.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable peril and the thrilling possibility of discovery.
