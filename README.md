
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and arcane secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the mysterious plague that stalked the land.  His journey was fraught with peril, a gamble against the elements and the unpredictable nature of man, yet the allure of Eldoria burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own set of dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the hope of reuniting with lost kin, and unlocking the secrets of Xylos' advanced technology, propelled her through the perils of interstellar space.
