
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a chaotic tapestry of creaking wagons, weary oxen, and sun-baked faces, snakes across the dusty plains of France.  Each sunrise brings the promise of bandits, blistered feet, and dwindling supplies, yet the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys pulls us onward.  The whispers of its gold and ancient magic are a siren song, a counterpoint to the ever-present fear of starvation and the relentless heat.  We travel not for comfort, but for glory, for legend, and the desperate hope of a better life beyond the familiar hardship.

Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cuts through the inky void, its destination the Crab Nebula, a swirling tapestry of vibrant colours and untold dangers light years from Earth.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates the treacherous currents of spacetime, her crew a diverse band of explorers united by their thirst for discovery. While the challenges are different – gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel – the thrill of the unknown, the push beyond established boundaries, remains the same driving force, echoing the adventurous spirit of medieval pilgrims and explorers alike.
