
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests the next hill, the sun a molten orb sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fuels her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness of the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his destination the unexplored Kepler-186f.  His mission: to chart the planet's resources for the burgeoning Galactic Federation.  The journey is fraught with peril – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, pirate raids from the Kryll Syndicate, and the constant hum of the ship's failing hyperdrive.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes, and the allure of the unknown propel him forward, a lone explorer venturing into the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
