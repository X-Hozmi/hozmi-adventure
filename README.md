
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising the lost city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance at the darkening sky, fueled her relentless pursuit.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences in her quest for glory and the legendary city.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking vistas of swirling gas giants and distant, shimmering nebulae.  While the dangers were different – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, remained as potent as it had been for Elara centuries before.
