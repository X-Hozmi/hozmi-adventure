
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood – a grim reminder of the bandits they’d evaded only hours before.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to the legendary shrine of Saint Jude, promised salvation for his ailing sister, but the journey was fraught with peril: treacherous mountain passes, hostile lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the malice of men.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of a nebula, the swirling colours a hypnotic distraction from the complex calculations needed to navigate the treacherous gravitational pull of a nearby quasar.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, a journey that would take her across countless light-years and potentially expose her to alien lifeforms, both friendly and hostile.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of her comms system, a lifeline to a distant, uncertain home.
