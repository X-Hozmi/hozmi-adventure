
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle for survival, each sunset a testament to his resilience, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering hope for the treasures – both material and spiritual – that awaited him.


Centuries later, Elara piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek starship hurtling through the void between galaxies. Her mission: to locate a mythical nebula said to contain the building blocks of a new energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were commonplace. Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulas and the promise of a future free from energy scarcity fueled her daring expedition, a cosmic voyage far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval adventurers.
