Each sunrise brought a new vista of rolling hills or dense forests, each sunset the promise of a different village, its inhabitants a mixture of wary suspicion and grudging hospitality.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, and the weather, a fickle mistress, could turn treacherous in an instant.

The quest for the legendary Xylos crystal, the key to faster-than-light travel, demanded courage and a readiness to face the unknown, even the unimaginable.
