
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his destrier across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort from his steed marks another mile in his arduous journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, feuding lords control treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, the glint of the distant sun, promising new horizons and the chance for glory, fuels his relentless stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps is routine, but the unknown dangers of alien landscapes and potential encounters with other civilizations keep her senses sharp.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, fuels her quest to expand humanity's reach across the galaxy, a journey as daring and uncertain as any medieval knight's pilgrimage.
