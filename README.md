
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pushed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of reaching Eldoria, fueled by his love for his sister, spurred him across the vast and unforgiving landscape, a solitary figure against the backdrop of a medieval world teeming with both beauty and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the far reaches of the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading hostile alien patrols, Eva and her crew faced cosmic horrors unimaginable to Thomas.  Yet, the shared bond of humanity, the unwavering desire to find a lost people, propelled them across the immense gulf of space, their ship a tiny speck against the grandeur, and terrifying immensity, of the cosmos.
