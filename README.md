
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained a desperate hope – to reach Avignon before the Black Death swept through her village. Every creak of the saddle, every distant hawk's cry, fueled the gnawing fear and the unwavering determination that drove her across sun-baked plains and perilous mountain passes, a lone figure against the vast medieval tapestry of hardship and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to exist on a planet orbiting a dying red giant.  Facing nebulae storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Ryla and her crew navigated a cosmic ocean far more treacherous than any terrestrial terrain.  Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of discovery, but also the terrifying possibility of never returning from the uncharted depths of space.
