He was leaving his village behind, bound for the distant kingdom on the other side of the treacherous Black Forest.

This was a journey of hope, a gamble against the relentless march of time. She had to believe that somewhere, among the countless stars, lay a new beginning, a chance for the human race to reclaim its future.
