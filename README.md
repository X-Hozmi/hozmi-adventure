
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she rode, the relentless sun beating down on her and her small band of mercenaries. Their journey across the vast, unforgiving plains of the Steppe was a constant battle against hunger, thirst, and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty – the promise of a lucrative contract in the distant city of Samarkand tempered by the ever-present danger lurking in the shadows of the ancient ruins and sprawling, untamed landscapes.  They traversed treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers, and navigated through dense, whispering forests, their resolve tested by every mile.

Conversely, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was less about physical hardship and more about the constant vigilance required to navigate treacherous asteroid fields and avoid the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars.  Her crew, a diverse collection of xeno-biologists and navigators, huddled around holographic displays, their faces illuminated by the swirling colours of the cosmos.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was isolating;  the silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship’s engines and the crackle of subspace communications, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of a medieval journey.
