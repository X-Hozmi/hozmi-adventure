
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping blight.  Each creaking step of her journey is fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering gleam in her eyes reflects a determination stronger than any hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast, star-dusted emptiness of space is a different kind of wilderness, equally dangerous.  Warp storms threaten to tear her ship apart, alien lifeforms lurk in unexplored systems, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel weighs heavily on her crew.  But the promise of reunion with long-lost kin fuels her tireless journey across the cosmic sea.
