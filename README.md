
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost kings.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, as he pressed deeper into the unknown heart of the Anatolian plateau, driven by a hunger for discovery that burned brighter than any physical hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the vastness of space a constant reminder of humanity's fragility.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the possibility of finding a new home amongst the stars, propelled her forward, a pioneer navigating a cosmic ocean of wonders and dangers.
