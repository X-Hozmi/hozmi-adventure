
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of saving his kingdom from a devastating plague.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the lure of Ys, and the hope it represented, pushed him relentlessly forward, a lone knight against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the journey still took months, punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the endless expanse of inky blackness punctuated by distant nebulae. Her mission: to establish first contact with the Xylos civilization, a species rumored to possess technology capable of solving the energy crisis crippling Earth. The vastness of space, the potential for unknown dangers lurking within unexplored star systems, and the weight of galactic diplomacy all rode on her shoulders as she navigated the perilous journey among the stars.
