
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust clouds against the fading light. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered promise of salvation fueled their weary steps, pushing them ever closer to their perilous destination.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  The vast expanse of the cosmos was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the threat of asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and unpredictable wormhole currents were constant companions. But the unwavering hope of aiding those struggling on the fringes of humanity spurred her onward, a modern-day knight errant navigating the endless star-strewn sea.
