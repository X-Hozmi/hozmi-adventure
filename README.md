
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both his determination and his growing apprehension.  Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself were all formidable adversaries on this perilous journey across the heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars was a constant battle against the vastness of space.   But the thrill of exploration, the potential to shape the future of humankind, outweighed the risks, driving her across the unimaginable distances between planets and galaxies.
