
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold the secret to healing her plague-stricken village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the unwavering hope of salvation spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each ache in her bones, fueled the burning determination in her heart.

Centuries later,  Jax's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the Andromeda Galaxy.  He wasn't searching for a lost city, but for a new beginning on a habitable planet, far from the dying embers of Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily struggle, but the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and the promise of a new dawn made the risks worthwhile. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, a soundtrack to his solitary, epic voyage.
