
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of weary oxen and even wearier men, crests the hill.  Before us sprawls the vast, untamed expanse of the Black Forest, a legend whispered in hushed tones around crackling fires.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, speaks of untold dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and arcane knowledge, pushes us onward, a flicker of hope in the heart of a perilous journey.  The road ahead is shrouded in mist, but the promise of adventure burns brighter than any torch.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out even the captain's booming laughter.  We are hurtling through the Andromeda Galaxy, a cosmic tapestry of nebulae and swirling star clusters, our destination the uncharted planet Xylos.  Xylos, they say, holds the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – a prize coveted by countless empires.  But the vastness of space is a lonely, unforgiving mistress.  Pirate raids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, hostile life forms test the mettle of our crew. Yet, the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fuels our daring voyage into the infinite.
