
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion against her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a whisper of gold and forgotten magic on the tongues of desert nomads.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving landscape itself.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, spurred her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigation charts blazed with the luminescence of nebulae and the cold, distant glitter of uncharted systems.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure – but the thrill of exploration, the tantalizing possibility of unraveling the universe’s mysteries, fueled their journey across the infinite canvas of space.
