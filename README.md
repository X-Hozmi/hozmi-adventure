
The creak of the wagon wheels was a constant companion, a rhythmic counterpoint to the wind whistling across the vast, undulating plains.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under the midday sun, squinted at the horizon, his gaze searching for the distant spire of Eldoria, their destination.  Each day brought its own trials – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of Eldoria's legendary treasures and forgotten magic, fueled his weary steps and spurred his companions onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the ears of Captain Eva Rostova, not the creak of wheels.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as they jumped across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her destination, the Kepler-186f system, held the potential for a new colony, a new beginning for humanity. But the journey was far from simple; unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders posed constant dangers.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulas, and the hope of a new world drove her and her crew relentlessly forward.
