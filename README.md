
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort in the vast, uncertain landscape.  He carried a worn map, its edges frayed, charting a course to the mythical city of Eldoria, a quest whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from York to Avignon.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey, but the lure of Eldoria’s rumored riches and wonders fueled his relentless stride.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of the cockpit.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation across the vast gulf of space was fraught with peril; asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms tested the crew’s mettle and the ship's resilience. Yet, the promise of discovering a new world, a new beginning for humanity, drove them onwards, past the shimmering boundaries of known space.
