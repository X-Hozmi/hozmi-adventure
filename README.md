
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones for its lost knowledge and ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both her and her mount tumbling into the abyss, and the ever-present gnawing hunger tested her resolve.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of adventure clinging to the wind, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from the established Galactic Federation.  The journey was a perilous dance with asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  But the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and scientific breakthroughs,  pushed him and his crew deeper into the cosmos, embracing the infinite possibilities – and dangers – of interstellar travel.
