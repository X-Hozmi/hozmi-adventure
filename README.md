
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind whipping at her worn cloak.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, heightens the tension, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that prowl these unforgiving lands.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starfire" Valerius pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos. His mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of Xylossian crystals across multiple galaxies, a seemingly impossible task given the volatile political climate and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, he faces challenges far beyond any medieval traveler could imagine, his courage tested by the vast, uncaring indifference of the universe.
