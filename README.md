
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the legendary city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, each sunset the gnawing hunger of the road.  Yet, the whispered tales of silk merchants, wise men, and fantastical beasts spurred her onward, a tapestry of potential adventures woven into the very fabric of her journey.  The sting of the desert wind was nothing compared to the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that could take generations.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of swirling cosmic dust and distant, vibrant planets.  But the cosmos held dangers beyond the known - rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Eva's courage was her compass, guiding her through the vast, uncharted expanse.
