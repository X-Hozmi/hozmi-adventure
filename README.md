
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey across the treacherous Midlands was a tapestry woven with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs swallowing unwary travelers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory.  Their quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – fueled their weary limbs and steeled their resolve against the endless miles.  The rough-hewn path was their only guide, the star-dusted sky their only solace.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from her homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the crippling effects of hyperspace travel were just some of the hurdles she faced. Unlike Sir Gareth, Elara had technology at her fingertips - but the vast, unpredictable nature of the cosmos posed a different kind of threat; one that felt equally isolating and unforgiving as the medieval wilderness.
