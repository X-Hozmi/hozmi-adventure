
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their battered packhorses strained under the weight of supplies for their perilous journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's ailing son.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, testing their courage and resilience as they traversed a landscape both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking alien flora and potentially hostile lifeforms. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond anything medieval travelers could comprehend. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, presented its own brand of terrifying isolation, a lonely struggle against the indifference of the cosmos.
