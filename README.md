
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow clinging to the biting wind.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried rations, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unpredictable whims of nature itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a test of endurance against the unforgiving landscape and the whispered legends that surrounded her quest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown – alien lifeforms, uncharted anomalies, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction light-years from any known help.  The cosmos presented a breathtaking expanse, but it was an unforgiving mistress, demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering spirit to conquer.
