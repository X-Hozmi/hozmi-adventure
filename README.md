
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a reminder of the perilous journey ahead to reach the Holy Land and fulfill his sacred vow. He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, hoping it would guide him to safety and salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a stark contrast to the medieval world, yet the thrill of exploration, the risk, and the potential reward remained fundamentally the same:  the insatiable human hunger for adventure.
