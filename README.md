
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's missive, a perilous commission to reach the faraway monastery of Saint-Gilles and deliver it before the plague swept further.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a vibrant counterpoint to the grim shadow of death that stalked the land.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra "Nova" Sharma piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable asteroid fields and treacherous wormholes. The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, was a different kind of wilderness than Elara's, but the spirit of adventure, the relentless pursuit of a distant goal, burned just as brightly in Lyra's heart.
