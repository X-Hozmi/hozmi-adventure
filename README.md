
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as he guides his weary steed across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a relic capable of healing his ailing King.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whisper of Eldoria, and the hope it represents, drives him onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Unlike Sir Reginald, her dangers are not bandits or starvation, but unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant hum of the ship's failing hyperdrive. Yet, the promise of a new dawn for humanity on a distant world fuels her journey across the vast expanse of space, a modern-day equivalent of the medieval knight's perilous pilgrimage.
