
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his destrier onward, the endless, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine stretching before him.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of the treacherous Baron Armand.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort of his horse, was a testament to the perilous journey ahead; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation all loomed large.  He clutched the tattered map, its faded ink his only guide through the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable expanse.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each alien system a potential threat.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding a lost people, pushed her onward, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
