
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he spurred his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His journey across the Holy Roman Empire was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry; it was a grueling test of endurance, fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his horse, was a testament to the perilous adventure unfolding before him, a quest for both glory and survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of hyperspace jumps remained a constant threat; rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms made each voyage a gamble.  Yet, for Eva, the allure of exploring the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, of discovering new worlds and civilizations, far outweighed the risks.
