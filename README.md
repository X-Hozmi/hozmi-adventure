
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn leather boots as he urged his weary steed onward.  The King's decree, a quest to find the mythical Sunstone, had led him across treacherous mountain passes and through dense, whispering forests.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, navigating by the unreliable stars.  He travelled with a small band of loyal companions, their faces etched with exhaustion but their spirits, fueled by hope and the promise of untold riches (or perhaps, just survival), still burning bright.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of hyperdrive engines, the crackling static of long-range communications, and the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and evade the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes.  Eva, with her crack crew, faced not just the harshness of space, but also the political intrigue and potential betrayals that plagued interstellar travel in the 27th century.
