
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – precious seeds of a rumored drought-resistant grain, vital to her village's survival.  Each day is a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  The journey to the fabled monastery holding these seeds has been fraught with peril, testing her courage and resilience beyond measure, yet the promise of sustenance for her people fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship *Stardust* cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading hostile K'tharr patrols, Rexa and her crew face cosmic storms and technological malfunctions with a grit born of interstellar exploration. The vastness of space holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, making each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the heart of the unknown.
