
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, her mule groaning under the weight of meager supplies.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing village, propel her onward.  The journey is arduous, a tapestry woven with both hardship and breathtaking beauty, the vastness of the unknown a constant companion.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The cosmos holds wonders beyond imagining – vibrant alien planets teeming with strange life, derelict spaceships hinting at forgotten civilizations, and the ever-present danger of asteroid fields and hostile alien factions.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of genetically-engineered crops to a drought-stricken colony light years away.  The vastness of space is a different kind of unforgiving, but the promise of life and survival fuels her journey across the galaxy.
