
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down relentlessly on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whisper of hope, the promise of salvation, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Facing dangers far beyond those of any medieval knight, Elara battled cosmic storms, navigated treacherous asteroid fields, and outsmarted ruthless space pirates.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, held a terrifying indifference, but the hope of finding her lost kin drove her forward, charting a course through the uncharted regions of the cosmos.
