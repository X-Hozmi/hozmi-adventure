
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a victory against the relentless mud.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as I rode towards the unknown, a knight errant bound for the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each sunrise brought a new landscape – sprawling forests guarding ancient ruins, treacherous mountain passes kissed by snow, and bustling market towns teeming with rumour and intrigue.  Bandits, storms, and the gnawing fear of the uncharted lay in wait, testing my resolve at every turn.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion, a low thrum that vibrated through my bones as we jumped between star systems.  My destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery at the edge of known space.  This journey, unlike any medieval pilgrimage, was measured in light-years, not leagues.  We navigated asteroid fields, dodged rogue black holes, and faced the ever-present danger of system failures.  But the allure of discovering a new world, a civilization potentially unlike anything humanity had ever encountered, made every risk worthwhile.
