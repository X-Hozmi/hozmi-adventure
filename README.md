
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she crested the hill, the sun a molten orb sinking behind the endless expanse of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map more faded than her hopes.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees, a barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whisper of a new life, a chance to escape the plague-ridden village she'd left behind, spurred her onward.

Centuries later,  Jaxx's boots, though equally worn, trod a deck plating far removed from dirt paths. The crimson nebula of Xylos blazed outside the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*, its light painting alien constellations across the ship's metal skin.  His mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent fungus from the methane swamps of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from his home in the Andromeda galaxy.  The risks were different – hostile alien flora, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – but the spirit of adventure, the yearning for the unknown, remained the same.
