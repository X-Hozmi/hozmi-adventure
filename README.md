
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, undulating plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and a worn map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her on, making the harsh reality of the journey a small price to pay.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been risky, pushing the ship's ancient engines to their limits, but the promise of a new, habitable world outweighed the danger.  Beyond the viewport, swirling galaxies painted a canvas of breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the cramped, metallic reality of her ship.  The journey was long, lonely, and fraught with the threat of cosmic radiation and unforeseen anomalies, but the potential for discovery fueled her every action.
