
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria and claim the Sunstone, was proving far more arduous than the crumbling maps suggested.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested his resolve at every turn.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, yet the lure of the Sunstone, and the whispered tales of its power, propelled him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora and fauna as dangerous as its unpredictable weather patterns.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable gravitational currents and pirate raids made every journey a gamble.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and mercenaries, relied on Eva's skill and unwavering courage to navigate the cosmic hazards and reach their destination before their oxygen ran out.
