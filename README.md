
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The map, crinkled and stained with sweat and rain, promised riches and glory beyond the Black Forest – a lost city whispered about in taverns, guarded by mythical beasts and untold treasures.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Survival depended on wit, courage, and the unwavering loyalty of his small band of companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere, a megastructure capable of harnessing the energy of an entire star.  The journey was fraught with its own perils: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment failure light-years from any help.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, demanding the utmost skill, precision, and resilience from Eva and her crew.
