
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a scroll detailing the rumored location of a lost monastery, said to contain ancient wisdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the far greater peril of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, spurred her onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks in hues of blood orange and dying gold.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its warp drive humming a song of cosmic energy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and alien threats that awaited.  The galaxy, vast and unforgiving, offered riches beyond measure – but only for those brave enough to risk everything in its pursuit.
