
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary horse across the unforgiving plains of Francia.  Each sunrise brings the chilling possibility of bandits, starvation, or the plague itself.  Yet, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered in hushed tones in taverns along the way, fuels her relentless journey.  The map, a tattered heirloom, is her only guide through the labyrinthine roads and treacherous mountain passes, each step a gamble against the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of space remains terrifyingly unpredictable.  Wormhole instabilities threaten to tear his vessel apart, and pirate incursions are a constant threat.  The lucrative cargo he carries, a rare bioluminescent crystal from the planet Kepler-186f, is worth the risk, a reward for daring to push the boundaries of the known galaxy. The endless black between stars holds a different kind of fear – the loneliness of the infinite.
