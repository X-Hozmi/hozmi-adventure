His quest: to recover the stolen relic of St. Jude, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous bogs swallowing unwary travelers, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, each sunset a hard-earned respite under a star-dusted sky, a testament to his courage and unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and perilous asteroid fields.

Each jump through hyperspace brought them closer to their goal, a beacon of hope amidst the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, a test of their skill and resilience against the immense unknown.
