
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across Europe, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales told in taverns.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swollen, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her steps, the whispered stories of miracles and the promise of salvation her only companions on this perilous trek.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily routine, far removed from the picturesque visions of star-hopping.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of wonder.  Each new planet offered a unique challenge, from battling gravity storms on Xylos to deciphering the ancient ruins of the lost civilization of Aethel.  The risks were immense, the distances unimaginable, but the pursuit of knowledge and the discovery of new worlds drove her relentless quest across the cosmos.
