His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's illness.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both man and beast, and the endless expanse of the unknown stretched before him, a tapestry woven with hardship, hope, and the ever-present shadow of death. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his stubborn perseverance.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.

The vast, indifferent cosmos was a canvas painted with breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, demanding both courage and ingenuity to traverse its endless expanse.
