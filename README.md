
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the thought of her brother spurred her on, fueling her journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of famine.  The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of peril – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, the knowledge that her cargo could save countless lives gave Rexa the strength to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents, pushing the boundaries of human exploration across the galaxy.
