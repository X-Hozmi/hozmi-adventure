His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scrolls of King Alaric.

The cosmic expanse held untold wonders and unimaginable dangers, but the lure of the unknown propelled her forward, driven by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the secrets of the lost colony.
