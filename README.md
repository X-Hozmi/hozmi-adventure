
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey to Canterbury was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the river crossings were treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought the promise of new hardship, but also the thrilling uncertainty of what lay ahead: a chance encounter with a wandering minstrel, the discovery of a hidden spring, the looming shadow of a Norman castle on the horizon.  Survival, and the sheer grit of pushing forward, fuelled his adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey, measured not in days but in years, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the breathtaking vistas of celestial bodies unknown.  Facing asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravitational pulls, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life, Eva pressed on, driven by the boundless human curiosity that had propelled explorers since the dawn of time, reaching for the stars and pushing the boundaries of the known universe.
