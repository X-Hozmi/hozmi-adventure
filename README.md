
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the unwavering hope in her heart propelled her across treacherous passes and through silent forests, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and asteroid fields was a daily routine, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion to the breathtaking views of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expansion, a journey fraught with peril from unforeseen celestial events and the lurking threat of unknown alien lifeforms, a challenge as daunting as any medieval quest but on an infinitely grander scale.
