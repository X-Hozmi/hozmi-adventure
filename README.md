
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-infested plains of Aethelred was far from the idyllic pilgrimage she'd envisioned.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of fear through her, a stark contrast to the unwavering hope fueling her quest to reach the legendary Healer's Monastery nestled in the distant mountains.  She carried a worn map, its edges frayed from countless anxious glances, her only guide through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the swirling nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily routine, far removed from the simple dangers of Elara's land journey. Yet, the risks were no less real.  The unknown stretched before them, a vast expanse promising both unimaginable wonders and catastrophic threats.  Ryla, at the helm, held her breath, her eyes fixed on the navigation console, her mission - to find a habitable planet for humanity's survival - a weight heavier than any mountain range.
