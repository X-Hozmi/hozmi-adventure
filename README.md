Their mission: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the ancient secrets of healing.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain trails, and the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the glint of distant snow-capped peaks and the whispered tales of the monastery spurred them onward, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse band of xeno-biologists and star cartographers, were on a quest to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, said to harbor life forms unlike any previously encountered.  Warp jumps were fraught with risk, unpredictable spatial distortions threatening to tear their ship apart.  But the promise of groundbreaking scientific discovery, and the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled their daring expedition across the cosmos.
