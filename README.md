
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the next rise, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, felt less heroic and more a grueling test of endurance.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the gnawing hunger in his belly mirrored the growing anxiety in his heart. Each day was a gamble against the elements and the malice of men, a harsh reminder of the precarious nature of life on the medieval road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace had been rough, the coordinates uncertain, and the eerie silence between transmissions a constant source of unease.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the psychological strain of the journey – the vast, uncaring expanse of space amplifying the loneliness and the weight of responsibility for the crew's lives.  The galaxy held wonders, but finding them demanded a courage that surpassed even the bravest knight.
