
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead, the Spine of the World mountains loomed, a jagged, snow-capped barrier to my journey to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Each creak of my pack, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened my senses, reminding me of the dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable whims of nature – that lay between me and my quest.  I clutched the worn map, its faded ink a testament to the perilous journey already undertaken.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones.  Beyond the viewport, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted the void in breathtaking colours.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the journey wasn't just about distance; it was about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders in their scavenged warships, and facing the unknown challenges of a world light years from home.  The vastness of space held both immense promise and terrible peril.
