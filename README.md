
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, its parchment brittle with age, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets – a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges:  negotiating with suspicious villagers, fording raging rivers, and navigating by the stars under a sky impossibly vast.  Survival depends on her wit, her resilience, and the unwavering loyalty of her loyal steed.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unimaginable dangers.  Warp drives hum, dodging rogue asteroids and the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes.  Alien landscapes, both beautiful and hostile, await discovery,  as does the potential for first contact with unknown civilizations – encounters that could either bring unimaginable prosperity or devastating conflict. The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars, both inspires and terrifies him.
