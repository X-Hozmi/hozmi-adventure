
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of the rutted track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret of eternal life.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of Zerzura, fueled their weary bodies and steeled their resolve against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a perilous dance through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  Unlike the medieval knights, she faced dangers unseen and unimaginable – rogue black holes, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone starships. Yet, the hope of connecting with humanity's farthest reach spurred her on, making the seemingly infinite distance a worthwhile endeavor.
