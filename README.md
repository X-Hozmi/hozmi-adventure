
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all hazards he faced, each sunrise bringing new challenges and uncertainties to his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  The legends promised glory, but the road was paved with hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the ravaged colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirate attacks were the realities of her interstellar voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her, a stark contrast to the confined world of her ship.  The fate of a colony rested on her shoulders, a far cry from Thomas's individual pursuit of fortune, yet both shared the common thread of courageous exploration in a world beyond their immediate reach.
