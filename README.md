
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth, a stark contrast to the biting winds that had lashed him the previous night.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Aethelburg, pushed him onward, despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of the ancient oaks. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers that lay in wait across this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her starship. Her mission: to establish contact with a newly discovered sentient species on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate squadron, Eva felt the familiar thrill of the unknown, the exhilarating pulse of exploration echoing in the vast emptiness of space.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery, of uncovering new worlds and civilizations, propelled her forward, fueled by the boundless curiosity that drove all true explorers.
