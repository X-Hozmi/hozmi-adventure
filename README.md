
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to Constantinople, a city shimmering in legend, a promised land of silks and spices.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the unknown beckoned, a siren's call stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Javelin piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic beauty a stark contrast to the cold, hard reality of intergalactic travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily routine, the thrill of exploration tempered by the ever-present danger of warp-core malfunctions and alien encounters.  Jax's destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace, a gamble worth taking despite the cosmic odds stacked against them.
