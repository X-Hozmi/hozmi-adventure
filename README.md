
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of the journey's length.  Yet, with each mile, her resolve hardens, fueled by the image of her brother's pale face and the whispered promise of a legendary oasis. The vastness of the unknown stretches before her, a tapestry woven with peril and hope.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp drives hum, navigating the treacherous currents between galaxies, while advanced sensors scan for any sign of the missing colonists.  The cosmos stretches before her, an infinite canvas of wonders and dangers, where the boundaries of space and time blur, and the weight of responsibility rests heavily upon her shoulders as she searches the vast emptiness for a faint signal of life.
