
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of York, a cart laden with meager supplies our only companion.  We traversed the treacherous, rutted tracks of England, the relentless sun beating down on our backs as we dodged bandits and navigated flooded fords.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – the whispers of the Black Death in distant villages, the looming shadows of ancient forests rumored to house malevolent creatures, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every milestone reached, the allure of the distant lands we sought fueled our relentless march westward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's warp drive is our constant companion, a low thrum that vibrates through our bones as we traverse the inky blackness of space.  The stars, once distant pinpricks, now rush past in a mesmerizing blur as we jump between galaxies, charting a course to the unmapped Kepler-186f.  Our mission: to seek out habitable worlds.  The dangers are different now - rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life. But the thrill of discovery, the vastness of the universe spread before us, makes every risk worthwhile.
