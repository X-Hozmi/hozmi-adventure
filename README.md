
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to harbor brigands and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril, requiring navigation by sun and stars, reliance on the hospitality (or hostility) of strangers, and the constant vigilance against bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory, etching a deeper understanding of the world and himself onto his weary soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable effects of hyperspace were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of swirling colours and celestial wonders, instilled both awe and a profound sense of solitude.  But the promise of a new dawn for humankind on a distant world fuelled her onward, through the black expanse, towards the light.
