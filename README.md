
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small prices to pay for the glory – and gold – that awaited. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril; asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp core failure tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  But the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped galaxies, and adding another star to humanity's reach spurred her onward, a modern-day adventurer navigating the cosmos instead of medieval forests.
