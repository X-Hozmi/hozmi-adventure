
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a jostling mass of men, beasts, and supplies, creaked across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunset brought the chilling prospect of bandit raids, while every sunrise revealed new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones around countless campfires, spurred us onward.  The promise of untold riches and unimaginable wonders fueled our weary steps.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship powered by harnessed singularities, cut through the inky blackness, its course charted across light-years of interstellar dust.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon extinguished from galactic records centuries ago.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of nebulae and the chilling silence of void, was both terrifying and awe-inspiring.  Each jump through hyperspace brought us closer to the unknown, to a destiny etched among the celestial tapestry.
