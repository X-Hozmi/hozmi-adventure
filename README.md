
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it represented, fueled their relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's sensors humming with the energy of a thousand distant suns.  Their mission: to establish a new colony on the habitable planet Kepler-186f, light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril, from unpredictable asteroid fields to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the weight of humanity's future on her shoulders, spurred Captain Rostova onward, towards the unknown wonders of the galaxy.
