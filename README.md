
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep into the churned earth.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled their weary steps.  The whispered legends, the glint of potential treasure, and the camaraderie forged in hardship made this perilous trek a grand adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of hyperspace, its destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda Galaxy.  The journey wasn’t measured in days or weeks, but in the subjective experience of time itself, punctuated by the occasional warp-jump tremor and the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling past their viewport. The risk was immense – hostile alien lifeforms, malfunctioning technology, the sheer vastness of space – but the reward was the potential to uncover new civilizations, unearth previously unknown scientific principles, and claim a piece of the boundless universe for humanity.
