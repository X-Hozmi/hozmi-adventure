
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Reginald's saddle as he guides his destrier across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Samarkand, rumored to hold a lost scroll detailing the secrets of King Arthur's sword.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But Reginald presses on, driven by ambition and a thirst for the unknown, his heart pounding with the rhythm of his horse's hooves and the beat of his own adventurous spirit.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the rumored lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world vanished without a trace centuries ago.  Navigation charts are unreliable, cosmic storms unpredictable, and the vastness of space itself a constant reminder of humanity's insignificance.  Yet, Eva, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the colony's fate, navigates asteroid fields, avoids alien predators, and endures the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, her determination a beacon in the cold, dark expanse.
