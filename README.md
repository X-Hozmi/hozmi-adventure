The parchment map, brittle with age, promised riches in the distant Sultanate – silks, spices, and perhaps even a glimpse of the mythical Sunstone.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were less alluring aspects of his journey, yet the lure of adventure burned brighter than any fear.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, was a potential story waiting to unfold.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the capricious gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unknown.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering light of distant galaxies, filled her with a profound sense of awe and a thrilling sense of the infinite possibilities – and perils – that lay ahead.
