
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of reaching Zerzura, fueled by his sister's life, propelled him across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the Xylos wormhole. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms was commonplace. The vastness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The fate of the colonists rested on her shoulders, and the journey across the galaxy held the promise of either salvation or a grim discovery.
