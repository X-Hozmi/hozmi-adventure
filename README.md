Each creak of the wagon wheels echoed the steady drumbeat of their hearts, keeping time with the perilous journey across the uncharted lands.

Though the journey was fraught with the unknowns of interstellar travel, Lyra thrived on the excitement, her thirst for discovery driving her ever onward into the vast, uncharted cosmos.
