
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess a miracle cure.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a fragile victory in her arduous journey across the medieval heartland.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a key element vital to intergalactic trade. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes glimpsed during hyperspace jumps. The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, tested the limits of her courage and technology in a quest across the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
