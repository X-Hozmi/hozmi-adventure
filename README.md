
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and woodsmoke clinging to her worn cloak.  Her quest, to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, had led her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the hushed awe of ancient ruins. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – dwindling supplies, suspicious villagers, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts – yet the whisper of Ys, a city swallowed by the sea, propelled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unknown expanse of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing the ship's aging hyperdrive were but a few of the hurdles.  The vastness of space, a canvas of twinkling stars and swirling cosmic dust, held both wonder and peril, the promise of discovery balanced by the ever-present threat of the unknown.  For Ryla, the galaxy was her medieval battlefield, a perilous yet exhilarating expanse to explore.
