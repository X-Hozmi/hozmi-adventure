
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of fertile lands beyond the oppressive grip of the Baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the vast, unknown landscape beckoned, its challenges a thrilling counterpoint to the stifling monotony of her past.  The road ahead was uncertain, dangerous, but undeniably hers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the vibrant colours of distant stars and nebulae, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace risked system failure, each new planet held the unknown - potential paradise or deadly alien encounter.  But the quest for new worlds, for a future beyond Earth's limitations, fueled her every action, her every breath.
