Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with rain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her steps, the whispered legends of the holy city a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.  Every hardship encountered sharpened her resolve, forging an indomitable spirit tempered in the crucible of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's console.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped gravitational anomalies, pirate incursions, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation.  Yet, the vastness of space held a magnetic allure, each new planet a tantalizing mystery, each star a potential doorway to untold wonders.  The risks were immense, but so too was the potential for discovery, driving her onward across the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
