
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Zerzura's magnificence, fueled his weary limbs and spurred him relentlessly westward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a civilization cut off from the rest of humanity for a millennia.  The journey was fraught with peril – navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the constant threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space.  But Eva, fueled by a burning desire to connect with her heritage and a profound sense of duty, charted a course through the celestial unknown, her resolve unshaken by the immensity of the task before her.
