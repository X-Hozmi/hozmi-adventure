
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aerthos was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and rumors of a monstrous beast guarding a vital mountain pass chilled her to the bone.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the promise of reaching the legendary Sunstone, a relic said to heal her ailing brother, spurred her relentlessly forward.  The weight of her pack, and the weight of her hope, pressed down on her equally.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel had its own unique terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids from the K'tharr Confederacy.  Her mission, to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony world of Aethel, was crucial; the planet's population faced a devastating plague.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered no respite; every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination in time.
