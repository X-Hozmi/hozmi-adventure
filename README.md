
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate moorland, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards of his homeland.  His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, a gem said to hold the power to heal his ailing king.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the medieval kingdoms.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden spacetime anomaly.
