
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a tattered banner.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the Rhône valley, a ribbon of green snaking between imposing mountains.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the weight of uncertainty, but the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s shimmering veil.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel, a gamble worth taking despite the treacherous gravity wells and unpredictable asteroid fields that littered the path.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, faced the unknown with a mixture of apprehension and exhilaration. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, yet the human spirit of adventure – the insatiable desire to explore the unknown – remained constant across the eons.
