
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, guided his destrier across the windswept plains.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort from his loyal steed, was a reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets lost to time.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the obstacles barring their path, yet the lure of adventure, and the promise of untold riches, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  Navigation through uncharted cosmic currents, the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids, and the chilling possibility of encountering unknown alien civilizations presented challenges far removed from Sir Reginald's, yet the spirit of exploration burned just as brightly in her heart. The vastness of space, however, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journey, offering a scale of adventure previously unimaginable.
