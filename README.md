
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a tattered map promising untold riches in a faraway kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of adventure spurred her onward, a small figure against the vast, breathtaking landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, the ever-shifting constellations a testament to the vastness of space.  The risks were different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failures. But the same thirst for discovery, the same yearning for the extraordinary, fueled his journey across the galaxy.
