
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a prayer against bandits and fever. The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as I traversed the unforgiving landscape between kingdoms.  My quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril through dense forests, across treacherous mountains, and over rushing rivers. Every sunrise brought the hope of reaching my destination, every sunset the chilling reality of the dangers that still lay ahead.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Stars blazed past in streaks of vibrant color as we hurtled towards Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, pressed in on me. While the dangers were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, the unknown – the thrill of exploration, the inherent risk, echoed the spirit of those medieval travelers forging their own paths across a far less alien, yet equally challenging, world.
