
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Blackwood Forest had been brutal.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elara, a task demanding not only courage but also cunning, requiring him to navigate treacherous mountain passes, ford raging rivers, and outwit the cunning thieves who held it captive.  His reward?  Glory, perhaps, but more importantly, the chance to restore faith to his struggling kingdom.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. This voyage, fraught with the peril of cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormhole jumps, was humanity's boldest yet. The vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Eva's mission: to establish a colony, to ensure the survival of humankind amongst the stars, a gamble that could secure the future of the species or lead to utter annihilation.
