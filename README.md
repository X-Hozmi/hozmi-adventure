
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth, his armour clanking, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael from a band of ruthless mercenaries holed up in a crumbling castle beyond the forest's edge.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the perils that lay between him and his goal – a journey as fraught with danger as it was with the promise of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against the ever-present threat of pirate raiders and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of her ship's engines, was a stark contrast to the medieval dangers Gareth faced, but the inherent risks – the unknown, the unforgiving void – were no less terrifying.  The weight of countless lives rested on her shoulders as she navigated the cosmic ocean.
