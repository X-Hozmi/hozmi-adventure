The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales of shimmering silks and exotic spices that fuelled his journey east.  Each creak of his saddle, each echoing clang of his meagre possessions, underscored the risks – bandits, disease, starvation – that lurked between him and the fabled city of Samarkand.  He clutched his worn map, its faded lines a promise of adventure and fortune, a stark counterpoint to the harsh reality of the road.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted across the viewport were breathtaking, a far cry from the sterile confines of her ship.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unknown dangers, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vastness of the cosmos, but the allure of discovery, of charting the unknown, pushed her onward, a modern-day explorer traversing a universe of infinite possibilities.
