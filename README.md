
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula stretching before her.  Her worn map, more faded dreams than reliable guide, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, whispering on the wind from distant cities. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of El Dorado, whispered about in hushed tavern tones, burned brighter than any fear, fueling her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Starseeker*, sliced through the inky void between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond anything humanity had yet achieved.  The jump through hyperspace had been brutal, a kaleidoscope of blinding light and disorienting pressure, but the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risks.  Ahead lay uncharted nebulae and potentially hostile alien civilizations, but for Ryla, the greatest adventure wasn't conquering the cosmos, but unraveling its mysteries.
