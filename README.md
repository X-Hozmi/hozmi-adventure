
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had become a perilous adventure.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to their resilience, their faith, and their unwavering determination to reach their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for colonization.  The journey was fraught with peril; rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms.  Yet, Eva and her crew pressed on, driven by humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery and the unwavering belief in a brighter future among the stars.
