
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to healing her plague-stricken village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the parched grass, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fuels her onward, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of medieval Europe.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the potential reward far outweighs the risks.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Serpent's Kiss*. His mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Across light-years of treacherous space, he avoids asteroid fields, dodges pirate raids from the Kryll syndicate, and faces the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  The vastness of space is a cold, lonely wilderness, but the promise of a new dawn for humanity on a distant world keeps him pushing forward, a lone voyager in the infinite expanse of the galaxy.
