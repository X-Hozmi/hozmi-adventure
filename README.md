
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the brutal winter and the even more brutal journey ahead.  The biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-covered plains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the distant, mournful howl of wolves.  My destination:  the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the icy grip of the north.  With only a meager supply of dried meat and a battered map as my companions, I pressed onward, the promise of adventure – and perhaps ruin – burning in my heart.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cramped cockpit.  Orion's nebula shimmered outside the viewport, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  My mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned Kepler-186f colony, a perilous undertaking across uncharted sectors.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, the thrill of exploration amidst the vast, unknowable expanse of space held me captive. The weight of the galaxy rested on my shoulders, but the stars themselves seemed to beckon me forward.
