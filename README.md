
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, her worn map clutched tight.  The scent of roasting lamb from a distant village is a fleeting comfort against the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing uncertainty of her journey.  She seeks the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune, a quest that demands more courage than any king's ransom.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-watchful eyes of those who would see her fail.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby as she navigates the swirling nebulae and uncharted star systems.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Cosmic radiation crackles against the hull, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of space. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the potential discovery of new worlds and civilizations, fuels her relentless pursuit across the vast, infinite ocean of stars.
