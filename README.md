Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst travelers, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of the Black Death, stalking the land like a shadowy specter.

Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained vast and unpredictable.  Cosmic storms, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms made every jump a roll of the dice – a cosmic gamble for survival amidst the breathtaking beauty and terrifying vastness of space.
