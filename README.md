
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their battered packhorses strained under the weight of supplies, their journey a perilous tapestry woven with the threads of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, from navigating murky swamps to bartering with suspicious villagers for meager sustenance. Their quest – to reach the mythical city of Eldoria – fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the harsh landscape of their medieval adventure.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time, yet the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip the ship apart, hostile alien patrols patrolled the void, and the ever-present threat of engine failure loomed.  But the hope of reuniting with long-lost humanity, a flickering signal across the vast expanse of space, propelled her onward in this interstellar odyssey.
