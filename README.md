
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel containing all she owned.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadows of the Black Forest were less fearsome than the burning desire to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk overhead, heightened the thrill of her uncertain journey, a constant dance between the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of vibrant nebulas and distant galaxies, instilled both awe and a healthy respect for the unpredictable dangers lurking amongst the stars.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a thrilling plunge into the unknown, propelled by the promise of discovery and the burning need to push the boundaries of human exploration.
