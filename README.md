
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's writ, a crumpled scroll clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches beyond imagining in the faraway city of Samarkand.  His journey, a tapestry woven with treacherous mountain passes, sun-baked deserts, and the ever-present threat of bandits, was as much a test of endurance as it was a quest for fortune. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a gamble with the unknown.  He carried not only the King's message, but the weight of his own dreams.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hyperdrive hummed a constant, low thrum against the silence of space, a symphony punctuated only by the occasional crackle of static from the comms array.  Ahead lay dangers far more alien than any bandit: rogue black holes, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile sentient life.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of finding a lost civilization, fueled her unwavering determination across the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
