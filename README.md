
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of El Dorado, had led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, bandit-infested forests, and into the heart of a simmering conflict between warring kingdoms. Each day was a gamble against starvation, disease, and the unpredictable violence of men.  Yet, the allure of unimaginable riches and the thrill of the unknown spurred him onward, his resolve unwavering.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to house ancient alien technology.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates were merely routine hazards on this interstellar journey.  The true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of the Kepler system itself, where unpredictable gravitational forces and volatile atmospheric conditions threatened to crush her vessel.  But Eva, a veteran of countless expeditions, pressed on, driven by the weight of her responsibility and the insatiable human hunger for discovery.
