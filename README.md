The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns – of exotic spices in faraway lands, of cities built of gold, and of monstrous beasts guarding forgotten treasures.  Each creak of his saddle leather, each strained muscle, fueled his ambition; this journey across the treacherous highlands, a perilous quest for a lost relic, was more than just travel – it was a test of endurance, a forging of legend.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula, vibrant colours painting her viewport.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  This wasn't a mere voyage; it was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the odds, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration in the face of unimaginable distances and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.
