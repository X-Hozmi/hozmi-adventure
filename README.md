
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the caravan as it lumbered across the parched plains, the midday sun beating down on Sir Gareth and his small band. Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, thirst gnawed at their throats, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers, and facing the constant uncertainty of the unknown. The promise of gold and glory spurred them onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the challenges she faced; navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen. The unknown terrors of alien landscapes and potential encounters with hostile life forms added a layer of constant, thrilling anxiety to her intergalactic voyage.  The fate of her crew, and possibly her entire civilization, rested on her shoulders.
