
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained a secret map, promising untold riches in a forgotten monastery hidden deep within the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that shared this untamed territory.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Navigation was a constant battle against stellar flares and unpredictable gravitational forces, but the promise of discovery – of new life, new worlds – fueled his relentless pursuit.  The cosmos held infinite mysteries, and he was determined to uncover them, one perilous hyperspace jump at a time.
