
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume him.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting an unmapped path, spurred him onwards,  a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were all part of the arduous journey.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to unlock the universe's deepest secrets, fueled her unwavering resolve, a beacon guiding her through the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
