Her journey across the breadth of France, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, each sunrise brought with it the promise of new landscapes, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the unwavering hope that fueled her arduous trek across the untamed land.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy.  His starship, the *Starseeker*, pulsed with the energy of a thousand suns as it warped through space-time, leaving the familiar constellations far behind.

The cosmos stretched before him, an infinite playground of adventure, waiting to be explored.
