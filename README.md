
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, wound its way across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as we navigated treacherous passes, the ever-present threat of bandits a shadow clinging to our heels.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – a raging river to ford, a crumbling mountain pass to traverse, the lurking menace of disease in the stagnant air.  Our quest, to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, fueled our determination despite the hardships, the whispered legends of its riches a potent elixir against despair.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams and titanium, leaped across the void, its hyperdrive a symphony of controlled chaos.  We are explorers charting the unmapped territories of the Andromeda Galaxy, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of space-time.  Nebulae painted vibrant masterpieces across our viewport, alien worlds shimmered like jewels in the black velvet, each promising untold wonders – or unimaginable perils. Our mission, to locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity, outweighed any personal fear of the unknown, the survival of our species our guiding star.
