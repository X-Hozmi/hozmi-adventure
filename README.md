
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, push onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, has become a desperate flight.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of the Black Death follow close behind. Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – treacherous terrain, ravenous wolves, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every hardship faced, their resolve hardens, fueled by a desperate hope to reach sanctuary before fate claims them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravity wells of rogue planets demanded pinpoint accuracy and nerves of steel.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the promise of discovery, but also the chilling possibility of encountering hostile alien life or encountering a catastrophic system failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.
