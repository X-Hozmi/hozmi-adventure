
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  The journey was arduous, fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every step.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of exotic lands and unimaginable riches, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks but in years of hyperspace travel.  The cosmos presented its own challenges: rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the constant hum of the ship's engines a relentless reminder of the vast, indifferent expanse surrounding her. But Eva, hardened by years of spacefaring, held onto the hope of finding her lost kin, a beacon guiding her through the infinite darkness.
