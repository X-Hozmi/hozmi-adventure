
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone Monastery nestled high in the Dragon's Tooth mountains, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at their bellies.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from fording icy rivers to navigating through dense, whispering woods haunted by local legends. Their hope, however, burned brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory space krakens was a daily routine, far removed from the perilous landscapes of Sir Kaelan's time. But the challenges remained just as daunting – the vast emptiness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning hyperdrives. Yet, the allure of discovery and the potential for a new beginning propelled them forward across the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
