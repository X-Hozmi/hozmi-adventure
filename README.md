
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the creak of his saddle and the clang of his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, and the promise of untold riches, kept him pushing forward through the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of grim determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic storms and rogue asteroids; instead of starvation, the constant threat of system failures and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel. But the vast, unknowable expanse of space, teeming with wonders yet unseen, held a magnetic allure that rivaled any earthly treasure, driving her ever further into the cosmic unknown.
