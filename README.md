
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown –  the rustle of unseen creatures in the tall grasses, the looming shadow of a distant mountain range promising both shelter and peril.  We barter for supplies in dusty villages, our journey punctuated by tense encounters with bandits and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of Constantinople, with its glittering markets and Byzantine splendors, pushes us onward, fueled by ambition and the intoxicating freedom of the open road.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship humming with controlled energy, leaps between galaxies, each jump a breathtaking gamble across the cosmic void. Our mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora. The vastness is humbling, the silence broken only by the ship's gentle hum and the crackling static of long-range comms.  We face the unknown – alien life forms, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, the creeping loneliness of deep space – but the promise of discovery, of forging humanity's destiny among the stars, outweighs all fear.
