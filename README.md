Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and untold riches. He sought the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold magical artifacts and unimaginable treasures, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching winter.  His only companions were his loyal squire and a worn map, promising adventure, or death.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to harbor sentient life.  Navigation was perilous, jumping through wormholes fraught with unpredictable gravitational forces and the constant threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space held both the thrill of discovery and the cold terror of isolation.  With her crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers, she risked all for the chance to expand humanity’s reach amongst the stars, a journey far grander, yet just as fraught with danger, than any medieval quest.
