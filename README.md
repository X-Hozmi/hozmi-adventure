Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of unimaginable wealth and forgotten magic fueled his journey, a perilous trek across bandit-infested plains and treacherous mountain passes, where the only constants were the gnawing hunger in his belly and the ever-present fear of the unknown.

The vastness of the cosmos was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a stark reminder of humanity's insignificance against the backdrop of unimaginable wonders and potential dangers lurking in the inky blackness between stars.
