
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, comprised of a disgraced knight, a cunning rogue, and a scholarly monk, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on our backs.  Our destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging our homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring rains.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it offered, spurred us onward through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  Aboard the 'Stardust Drifter,' a nimble freighter capable of navigating the wormholes between galaxies, we journeyed across the vast emptiness of space.  Our cargo: rare minerals from the Xylos system, destined for the bustling spaceport of Nova Prime.  Along the way we encountered alien life – some friendly, some decidedly not –  faced down pirate attacks, and navigated asteroid fields, all against the breathtaking backdrop of nebulas and distant galaxies.  The universe, it turns out, is a far more dangerous but equally exhilarating place to travel than any medieval kingdom.
