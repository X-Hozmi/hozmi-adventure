
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving rivers swollen with spring thaw, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of hope in his sister's eyes fuels his tireless journey, pushing him onward despite the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Hyperspace jumps offer glimpses of breathtaking cosmic wonders, but the journey is fraught with peril: rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Yet, the knowledge that her cargo will sustain a burgeoning civilization makes the risks worthwhile, a testament to humanity's unwavering spirit of exploration.
