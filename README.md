
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  The journey was fraught with peril, a constant test of endurance and wit, but the lure of the unknown propelled him relentlessly across the harsh landscapes of medieval Europe and into the vast, uncertain expanse beyond.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, far removed from the challenges of Thomas's era. Yet, the inherent dangers were no less real; hostile alien lifeforms, malfunctioning engines, and the sheer immensity of space itself presented a constant threat.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos offered a different kind of adventure, a breathtaking voyage into the unknown depths of the galaxy.
