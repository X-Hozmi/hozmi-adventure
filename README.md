
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn boots crunched on the rutted track. His quest, to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, led him across treacherous mountains, through shadowed forests where wolves howled defiance, and across plains baked hard by a relentless sun.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits ambushing from rocky outcrops, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches fueled his weary limbs and hardened his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and contending with the unpredictable whims of warp travel tested her skill and courage to the limit.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the incredible distances she was traversing and the immense unknowns that lay ahead.
