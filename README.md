
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of our wagon wheels was a testament to the miles already conquered, each ache in our bones a reminder of the miles yet to go.  We were bound for the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate hope for redemption, facing down bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease with gritted teeth and unwavering resolve.  The adventure, though brutal, forged bonds stronger than steel.

Centuries later, the Althea, a starship larger than any mountain, pierced the inky blackness of space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse of the cosmos. We were pioneers, charting unknown territories, facing dangers beyond human comprehension—nebulae teeming with unknown radiation, gravitational anomalies that threatened to tear our ship apart, and the ever-present fear of encountering something truly alien. But the promise of discovery, the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fuelled our every action.
