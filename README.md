
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every step. Yet, with each creak of her saddle and rise of the terrain, a thrill pulsed through her – the thrill of the unknown, of testing her limits against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  This was more than just a journey; it was a testament to her spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and warping through unstable spacetime was commonplace; the real adventure lay in the thrill of discovery.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of the cosmos.  Unlike the limited horizons of medieval travel, Eva stared into an infinite expanse, the possibilities as boundless as the stars themselves.
