
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and thief, trudged through the mud-caked ruts of a forgotten Roman road.  Each sunrise brought the promise of fresh danger – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and magic, pushed us onward, spurred by dreams of glory and the desperate need for escape from the plague-ridden lands behind us.  The clang of our armor against the rough stone was a constant reminder of our precarious journey, a symphony of hope and fear echoing against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our roads.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Starseeker' cut through the inky blackness of intergalactic space, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of nebulae and distant galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant lullaby, a stark contrast to the breathtaking views of swirling cosmic dust and planets shimmering with alien atmospheres.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for discovery, or oblivion – the thrill of exploration tempered only by the profound isolation of the vast cosmos.
