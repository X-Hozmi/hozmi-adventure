
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of Ys, a city lost beneath the waves, fueled his weary steps, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-regenerative enzyme from the distant planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the temporal distortions of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned intergalactic courier.  But the thrill of exploration, the breathtaking vistas of uncharted galaxies, and the unwavering hope of delivering life-saving medicine to a dying world were worth every risk.
