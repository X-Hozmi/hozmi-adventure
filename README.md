
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush, or worse – the creeping despair of the plague itself.  He carried with him only his sword, his faith, and the tattered map promising salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her command bridge. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Each jump through hyperspace, each subtle shift in astrogation, held the potential for navigational error, pirate attack, or the terrifying unknown that lurked beyond the charted stars.  She carried with her only her crew, her wits, and the faint hope of a distant salvation.
