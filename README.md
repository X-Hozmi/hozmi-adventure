
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onwards, the setting sun painting the rugged Tuscan landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meagre provisions in dusty villages.  But with every hardship overcome, Elara felt a growing sense of accomplishment, her spirit strengthened by the vastness and beauty of the world unfolding before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky blackness of deep space.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast distances were measured not in days, but in light-years, and the challenges were equally immense – navigating asteroid fields, enduring prolonged periods of hypersleep, and facing the unknown terrors that might lurk within unexplored nebulae.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unveil the secrets of the cosmos, propelled Ryla forward, each newly charted star a testament to human courage and unwavering ambition.
