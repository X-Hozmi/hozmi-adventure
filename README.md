
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover ancient secrets, fueled her onward, each creak of the saddle a step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate ships was a daily challenge, but the potential rewards – unimaginable wealth and technological advancement – outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with celestial wonders and lurking dangers, stretched before him, a testament to human ambition and the endless pursuit of the extraordinary.
