
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and fear clinging to the air.  Her worn map, a tattered testament to her journey, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent shivers down her spine – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the plague lurked in the shadows, testing her courage and resilience with every league she covered.  This was not a pilgrimage of comfort, but a desperate race against time across a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Vance navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the treacherous Xylos currents posed a unique challenge; a single miscalculation could mean disintegration.  Her mission: to recover a lost artifact from a derelict alien vessel, a gamble that promised untold riches or a grim end among the swirling gases and ancient, unknown dangers. The galaxy offered endless opportunity, but the price of exploration always remained the same – risk.
