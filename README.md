
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes challenge his strength, and the whispers of a mythical beast guarding a crucial river crossing haunt his nights.  Each sunrise brings a new hardship, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile closer to his goal, fueled by a mixture of faith, determination, and the gnawing fear of failure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace is a gamble, the potential for encountering rogue asteroids and unpredictable space anomalies a constant threat.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, face isolation and the immense pressure of their crucial task, their courage sustained by the promise of a new beginning for humanity among the stars.
