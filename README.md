
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and exhausted oxen, crawls across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in hushed tones, drives us onward.  The rough-hewn map, tattered and stained with sweat, is our only guide through this unforgiving landscape, our compass a flickering hope against the vast unknown.

Centuries hence, the stars are our highways.  My starship, *The Wanderer*, leaps across the void, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of a thousand nebulae.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel, takes years, measured not in days but in the cycles of distant suns.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  The risks are immense, the rewards potentially limitless – a future unbound by the confines of a single world.
