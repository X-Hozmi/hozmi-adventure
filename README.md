
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the parched Breton countryside.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hastily scribbled notes, guides her westward, towards the legendary lost city of Ys.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each whispered rumour of brigands in the shadowed forests, adds to the thrilling uncertainty of her journey.  The biting wind and gnawing hunger are small prices to pay for the chance to uncover history's forgotten secrets.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is a constant companion, a reassuring tremor against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space debris is routine, but the allure of discovering new life, new worlds, fuels his every action.  The ultimate adventure lies not just in reaching his destination, but in the unknown that awaits him beyond the shimmering veil of the stars.
