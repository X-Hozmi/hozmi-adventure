Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the promise of untold riches and forgotten lore spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each sting of the sun, fueled the burning desire to reach the legendary city before winter's grip tightened its icy hold on the land.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate raids. But Rexx, hardened by years spent navigating the treacherous currents of interstellar space, pressed on, driven by the boundless human curiosity to explore the cosmos and unlock its infinite secrets.
