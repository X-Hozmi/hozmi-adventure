
Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the fading light, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, swallowed the sounds of their progress.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension.  They were weeks into their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, pursued by both bandits and the lingering chill of a winter that refused to relent.  The promise of adventure, the lure of the unknown, outweighed the ever-present dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a kaleidoscope of gas and dust, masked the treacherous asteroid fields that lay ahead.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, instilled a humbling sense of isolation; each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.
