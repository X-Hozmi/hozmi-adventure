The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous – towering castles perched precariously on cliffs, forests whispered with unseen dangers, and rivers that flowed like ribbons of molten silver.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.
