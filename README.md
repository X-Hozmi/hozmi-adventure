
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving wilderness itself.  He carried only a meager supply of food, a well-worn map, and the unwavering hope that fueled his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscapes of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of the Cygnus X-1 system, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology.  The journey was a perilous dance with gravitational anomalies and unpredictable wormholes, punctuated by the silent hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across the immeasurable distances separating the stars, driven by the same unwavering hope that had propelled Thomas centuries before.
