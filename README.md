
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The parchment clutched in her hand, detailing the location of a mythical lost city, was her only guide through the unforgiving wilderness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey, testing her resolve with every sunrise.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of uncovering ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a beacon in the harsh landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and seek out habitable planets for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the thrill of the unknown, a gamble against unforeseen celestial anomalies and hostile alien life.  The vast emptiness of space, while terrifying, held the promise of new beginnings, a chance to rebuild and thrive among the stars.
