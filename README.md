
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce supplies in unforgiving villages, and facing the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of the sacred city, the whispered tales of miracles and the sheer thrill of the journey itself, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable risks.  Navigation relied on unstable wormholes and untested warp technologies, while the vast emptiness of space held perils unseen: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But the potential discovery of new worlds, the expansion of human knowledge, and the boundless excitement of exploring the cosmos, fuelled her unwavering determination.
