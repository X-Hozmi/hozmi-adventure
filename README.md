
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease test his resolve at every turn, each sunrise bringing new perils and uncertainties as he presses ever onward, his hope fueled by the desperate pleas of his afflicted people.  The journey is a brutal tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of unexpected kindness from the strangers he encounters along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Warp jumps carry her across vast interstellar distances, each jump a gamble against unpredictable spatial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Alien landscapes, breathtaking in their otherworldly beauty, offer both wonder and danger, challenging her crew's ingenuity and resilience as they race against time, facing not only the perils of space but also the insidious corruption that threatens to unravel their expedition from within.
