
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of the opulent cities whispered about in hushed tones by fellow travelers. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey, a tapestry woven with danger and the heady thrill of the unknown, driving her relentlessly westward towards the mythical lands beyond the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was a calculated risk, a daring gamble to reach the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold a source of energy powerful enough to solve the galactic power crisis.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and the constant threat of warp-core failure were just a few of the hazards Jaxon faced, each a test of skill and nerve as she pursued a future that promised either unimaginable wealth or utter annihilation.
