
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a tattered map – her only guides on this perilous journey to the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, of the unknown dangers that lurked around every bend in the treacherous mountain passes.  Bandits, starvation, and the elements themselves were constant threats, but the allure of the East, of silks and spices, and the whispers of lost knowledge, pushed her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  The swirling nebulae painted a breathtaking canvas outside her viewport, a far cry from the mundane greens and browns of medieval landscapes.  Her mission: to chart unexplored systems and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast cosmic unknown, with the constant threat of pirates, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present danger of navigational errors. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for finding a new home for her species, fueled her unwavering resolve.
