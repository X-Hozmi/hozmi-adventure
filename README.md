
Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the relentless sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The dusty track, barely a trail in places, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease. Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, rumored to be hidden in the far-off kingdom of Eldoria, propelled him forward, fueled by ambition and a thirst for adventure beyond the confines of his castle walls.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational pulls, and battling the ever-present threat of space pirates were just part of the routine.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of peril than the medieval world, but the spirit of exploration, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, burned just as brightly within Eva's heart as it had in Sir Reginald's.
