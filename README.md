
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Fiacre, was fraught with peril. Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the terrain treacherous, and the ever-present gnawing hunger a relentless companion.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching their destination, tempered by the grim reality of unforgiving miles and unpredictable dangers lurking in the shadows of ancient forests and crumbling castles.  Their adventure was a test of faith, endurance, and the bonds of camaraderie forged in hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of dying stars was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable quantum currents that threatened to tear her ship apart.  The vastness of space amplified the loneliness of her journey, but the promise of scientific discovery and the thrill of charting uncharted territories fueled her unwavering determination.
