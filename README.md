
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the dust-choked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the Silk Road, whispering promises of exotic spices and unimaginable wealth, keeps us pushing onward. The camaraderie forged in shared hardship, the breathtaking landscapes, and the thrill of the unknown fuel our journey across the vast expanse of medieval Eurasia.


Thousands of years later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Starseeker*, a colossal vessel powered by harnessed singularities, cuts a path through the nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped territories of a newly discovered star cluster, seeking habitable planets and valuable resources.  The vast emptiness of space, the vibrant colours of alien nebulas, and the potential discovery of sentient life beyond our own species make this interstellar odyssey a thrilling, if perilous, adventure.
