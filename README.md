
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept moors.  Their destination: the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost secrets of alchemical mastery.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of glory, spurred them onward, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation as they navigated the untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a red dwarf star lightyears from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns and the occasional meteor shower, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of system malfunctions kept the crew on edge, but the knowledge that their cargo could mean survival for a distant colony fueled their unwavering determination.
