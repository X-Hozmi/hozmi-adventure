
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic capable of ending the plague that ravaged their kingdom.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria and the hope it offered fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the besieged colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships were everyday occurrences. The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – the silent malfunction of critical systems, the isolating loneliness of interstellar travel, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But the unwavering belief in humanity's future spurred Eva and her crew onward, across the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
