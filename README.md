
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a stark contrast to the lush meadows promised in the rumors of the fabled Eldoria.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, heightened the sense of peril and anticipation.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements were constant companions on this arduous journey, yet the whisper of Eldoria's untold riches and mystical powers fueled his relentless stride.  He carried more than a sword; he carried a dream.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a breathtaking distraction from the complex astrogation calculations.  Her mission: to locate the mythical lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space held both the promise of discovery and the cold, silent threat of the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unimaginable distances between star systems, yet the potential rewards—a technological breakthrough, the salvation of her people—made the risks worthwhile.
