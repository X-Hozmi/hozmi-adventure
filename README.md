
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than coin; it contains letters from her estranged brother, hinting at a lost inheritance and a dangerous secret.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature all threaten her arduous journey across the medieval world.  She is driven by hope, fueled by grit, and utterly alone in the vastness of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the light of a binary sunset in the Xylos system.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across galaxies demands precision navigation, a steady hand on the controls, and a nerves of steel to face the unpredictable dangers of space – from rogue asteroids to hostile alien lifeforms.  Ava, alongside her crew, pushes the boundaries of human exploration, their ambition as boundless as the cosmos itself.
