
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a destination fueled by rumour and desperate hope.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Starseeker* through a nebula, its vibrant colours painting the bridge in an ethereal glow.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to possess a unique energy source capable of solving the galactic energy crisis.  The journey across the vast expanse of space was a gamble, fraught with the dangers of unknown celestial bodies, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of warp storms.  But the potential reward – a future free from energy scarcity – made the risks worthwhile for this intrepid crew.
