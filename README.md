
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and dark forests, promising both breathtaking vistas and perilous encounters.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield, but a king's desperate plea for aid, a journey that would test his courage and loyalty across treacherous mountains and lawless lands, a quest that might either secure his place in history or leave him a nameless skeleton bleaching beneath a foreign sun.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting the cockpit in shades of hellfire.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. This voyage, undertaken for the sake of humanity's survival, was a gamble against impossible odds;  navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the unknown terrors of interstellar space were all but guaranteed.  The survival of her crew and the future of the human race rested on her shoulders, a weight far heavier than any medieval knight's burden.
