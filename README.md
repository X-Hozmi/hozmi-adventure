
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical creatures kept her ever vigilant.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance and cunning, but the promise of Eldoria’s legendary healing balm fueled her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining crystals to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids punctuated the vast emptiness of space.  The distances were unimaginable, the risks astronomical, but the lives of Kepler's colonists, the promise of a thriving future, were worth navigating the treacherous cosmic currents.
