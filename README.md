
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each day brought new challenges, demanding resourcefulness and courage, but the promise of reaching the fabled Sunstone City, and the whispered secrets it held, fueled her onward.  The rough-hewn path was a tapestry of hardship and hope, woven with the sweat of her brow and the beat of her own determined heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a vibrant world orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Navigation through the treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates was a constant test of skill and nerves.  But the breathtaking vistas of nebulae painted across the cosmos, and the knowledge she was contributing to humanity's expansion across the galaxy, made the risks worthwhile. The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril, a lonely grandeur that dwarfed even the most fearsome medieval wilderness.
