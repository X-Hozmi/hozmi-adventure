
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, and the meager supplies dwindled with each passing day.  Yet, the spirit of adventure burned bright, fueled by whispered tales of miracles and the shared hardship forging an unbreakable bond between these weary travelers.  The sun beat down mercilessly, each step a test of endurance, but the promise of the holy city kept them moving, one agonizing mile at a time.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kestrel piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with unimaginable dangers.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear the ship apart, and unknown celestial phenomena lurked in the inky blackness.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to map uncharted territories and unveil the universe's secrets, propelled her forward.  Every jump into hyperspace was a gamble, but the vast expanse of the cosmos held a siren's call she couldn't resist.
