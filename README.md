Bandits lurked in the shadows of craggy peaks, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the whispering reeds beside the river.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – perilous mountain passes, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with unknown dangers.

The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, was also terrifyingly isolating – a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the backdrop of an uncaring cosmos.  Yet,  the call of the unknown, the potential for groundbreaking discovery, pushed Eva and her crew further into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
