Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of adventure spurred them onward, fueled by the whispered tales of lost cities, forgotten treasures, and the promise of uncharted lands. The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in the face of hardship, and the hope of finding their own slice of glory, were the cornerstones of their journey through the medieval world.

The weight of the unknown, the dangers lurking in the void, and the promise of unlocking cosmic mysteries fuelled their every step as they journeyed beyond the boundaries of their own solar system, venturing into the boundless expanse of the future.
