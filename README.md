
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, the scent of woodsmoke and roasting meat clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead lay the long road to Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very mountains themselves seemed to conspire against the weary traveler.  Yet, the lure of the East, the whispered tales of exotic spices and shimmering silks, spurred me onward, each sunrise a promise of new adventures and unforeseen challenges.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was my constant companion.  The swirling nebula outside the viewport, a kaleidoscope of impossible colours, was a breathtaking but familiar sight. This wasn't my first intergalactic voyage, but the destination—the Xylos system, famed for its sentient flora—still held a thrill.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate raids were commonplace hazards, but the true adventure lay in the unknown, in the potential for discovery amongst stars never before charted by human eyes.
