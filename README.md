
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage spurred by a desperate hope for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very roads themselves seemed to conspire against her, riddled with potholes and treacherous mud.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the unwavering flicker of hope in her heart, fueled by love for her sibling, pushed her ever closer to her destination.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the ship's controls.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with potential but isolated by light-years of interstellar space.  Warp jumps were treacherous, unpredictable anomalies a constant threat, but Ryla's decades of experience gave her the calm confidence to navigate the vast, unforgiving expanse of space. The weight of responsibility for her crew, and the future of the colony, fueled her determination.
