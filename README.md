
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the treacherous Pyrenees mountains was a desperate gamble, a flight from a vengeful Baron and a desperate hope for a new life in the distant city of Toulouse.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of fear down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of freedom spurred her onward, a burning ember of hope against the cold reality of her perilous trek.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky black between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby, masking the vastness of space – a terrifying, beautiful expanse filled with nebulae painted across the void and the distant glimmer of uncharted planets. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were astronomical – unmapped wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present danger of equipment failure in the unforgiving emptiness. Yet, the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, drove Ryla and her crew forward into the unimaginable.
