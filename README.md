
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the creeping blight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, and the very real threat of bandits, starvation, or the plague itself.  The road was long, the journey perilous, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled her steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the Xylos system was notorious for its unpredictable wormholes and aggressive Kryll raiders.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and mercenaries, relied on Ryla's sharp instincts and advanced technology to navigate the treacherous cosmic currents.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but reaching them demanded courage and a willingness to risk everything.
