
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling breath of the plague itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie forged in shared peril, and the ever-present hope of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Void Serpents was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the warring factions that controlled the jump points.  Her voyage was not just about exploration; it was a gamble on the future of humanity, a high-stakes game played across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
