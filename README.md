The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the city he'd fled.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery nestled in the heart of the Whispering Mountains, said to hold the cure for his sister's illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of reaching his goal fueled his weary limbs and hardened his resolve.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields that threatened to rip her ship apart, rogue gravitational pulls that threatened to send them hurtling into oblivion, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive that vibrated through her very bones.  But Elara, a veteran explorer with a thirst for the unknown, pressed on, driven by the potential discovery of life beyond human comprehension and the thrill of charting unmapped territories in the vast expanse of the cosmos.
