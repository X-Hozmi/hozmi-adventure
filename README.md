
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, guided his weary horse across the rain-lashed moor.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each creak of his saddle, each flash of lightning, fueled his determination; this perilous journey, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, was a testament to his unwavering love.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a rogue gravitational anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the tendrils of cosmic radiation, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and the cutting-edge technology of her vessel. The vast emptiness of space amplified the stakes, making the success of her mission, a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of the cosmos, paramount to the survival of a forgotten people.
