
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the King's ailing son.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, fuelled by the King's plea and whispers of Eldoria's magnificence, kept him pressing onward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the Xylos colony, a human outpost struggling against the harsh conditions of a newly-settled planet.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate incursions across vast interstellar distances tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  The breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the thrill of charting unmapped star systems provided a stark contrast to the ever-present danger, transforming a logistical run into a breathtaking, high-stakes adventure among the stars.
