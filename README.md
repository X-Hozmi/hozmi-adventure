
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, had led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of the Whispering Woods.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, ravenous wolves howling at the moon, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of the saint's healing touch, and the glory that awaited a successful return, fueled their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart a course through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and battling the relentless wear and tear of interstellar travel tested the crew's mettle to the limit.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held both unimaginable wonders and deadly perils, making every jump to hyperspace a gamble with their lives.
