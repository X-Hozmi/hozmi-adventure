
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and thyme battling the ever-present stench of sweat and unwashed wool. Her quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and constantly watching the horizon for signs of both friend and foe.  Survival was the only certainty on this arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson glow of its dying sun.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of warring K'tharr space pirates was far from a simple task.  The vast emptiness of space held as many dangers as the sprawling wildernesses of old, demanding a different kind of courage and resourcefulness to reach his destination alive.
