
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura had already claimed two pack animals and tested their meager supplies to the breaking point.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the whispered promise of Zerzura's legendary riches and the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  The vast distances, the unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations were far removed from the medieval dangers Elara faced, but the inherent thrill of discovery, the push into the unknown, resonated across the millennia, a timeless human craving for adventure.
