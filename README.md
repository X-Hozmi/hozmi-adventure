
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Each step was a gamble against the unforgiving terrain, the icy slopes promising a swift and deadly end.  My destination, the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones at taverns across the land, spurred me onward.  Rumors of untold riches and ancient magic fueled my journey, outweighing the ever-present danger of bandits, starvation, and the elements themselves.  The road ahead remained uncertain, a tapestry woven with equal parts hope and fear.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light years from Earth.  The view from the observation deck was breathtaking; a swirling nebula of unimaginable beauty, a cosmic canvas splashed with vibrant colours.  While the dangers were different – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the threat of unforeseen celestial events, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life – the thrill of exploration, the boundless curiosity, remained the same.  This voyage, a pilgrimage to the unknown, was a legacy to the medieval adventurers who dared to dream of worlds beyond their own.
