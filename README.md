
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on our backs.  The King's decree had sent us across the treacherous Black Forest, its gnarled branches a skeletal embrace.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadows, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of reaching the distant city of Prague, fueled our steps. The whispered legends of its hidden treasures and arcane knowledge spurred us onward, despite the perils.


Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cut a silent path through the swirling nebula.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls, her gaze fixed on the swirling cosmos outside.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in Earth-time.  The vastness of space, the constant threat of rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes, were a far cry from the forests and bandits of old, yet the spirit of adventure remained the same – a yearning to explore the uncharted, a quest for knowledge and discovery beyond the known.
