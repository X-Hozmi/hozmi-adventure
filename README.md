
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats and a well-thumbed map, promising riches and perhaps even a cure for her ailing brother in the distant city of Toledo.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions on this perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  But the whispered tales of Toledo's fabled healers fueled her courage, driving her onward despite the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, light years from her homeworld.  The journey, punctuated by hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, was a symphony of advanced technology and raw human courage.   The vast emptiness of space, teeming with unseen dangers and the thrill of discovery, held a different kind of peril than Elara's medieval trek, but the same unwavering spirit of adventure burned in Eva's heart.
