
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like the teeth of some monstrous beast.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and rain-soaked stains, offers little comfort against the biting wind.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones by weary travelers – a prize worth the risk of bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain. Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath of her mule, marks another step towards the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harboring life.  The journey is a symphony of flashing lights, the hum of the hyperdrive, and the constant crackle of subspace communications. Though the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, cosmic radiation, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes – the thrill of discovery remains the same. The vast emptiness of space holds both terrifying unknowns and the tantalizing promise of something extraordinary.
