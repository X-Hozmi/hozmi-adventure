
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, comprised of a grizzled knight, a cunning thief, and a scholarly monk, trudged through the mud-caked ruts of a barely-there road.  Their destination: the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the promise of salvation fueled their onward journey, pushing them beyond their limits of endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the starving colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate raids were commonplace hazards.  But the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, punctuated by the shimmering light of distant galaxies, offered a counterpoint to the urgency of her mission, reminding her of the boundless wonders that awaited beyond the known stars.
