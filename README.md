
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the silent, creeping death itself.  Her journey was a gamble against fate, a desperate dash across a landscape both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey was fraught with peril, from rogue asteroids to the unpredictable warp currents that threatened to tear her vessel apart.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting humanity to a universe teeming with untold wonders, fueled her every action, a daring voyage across the cosmic sea.
