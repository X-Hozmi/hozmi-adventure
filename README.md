
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes,  hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the unwavering hope of finding Eldoria fueled his journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe, a journey fraught with peril, but rich with the promise of adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous charting expedition to a newly discovered galaxy.  The vastness of space, with its shimmering constellations and hidden dangers like rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes, presented challenges far beyond any medieval traveler could imagine.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the chance to map uncharted territories and uncover the secrets of the universe, propelled Eva and her crew across the interstellar void, a journey as exhilarating as any knight's quest, only on a scale unimaginable to those who walked the Earth centuries ago.
