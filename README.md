
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth’s surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees a fiery orange. His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King of Aragon, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers fordable only by the bravest, and past villages where suspicion burned brighter than any hearth fire.  Each day brought a new challenge – bandits, raging storms, the gnawing hunger in his belly – yet the urgency of his mission fueled his resolve, transforming every hardship into a step closer to his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of her starship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure tested her skills and courage to their limits.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of connecting with a lost fragment of humanity, propelled her onward through the uncharted vastness of space.
