
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance.  Muddy tracks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits had become their daily companions. Yet, the whispered tales of miracles and the glint of distant snow-capped peaks spurred them on, each sunrise a new chapter in their perilous adventure across the medieval world.  

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Warp drives hummed, starlight painted vibrant streaks across the cockpit, and the vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy stretched before her.  The dangers were not bandits and bad weather, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light years from any friendly port.  Yet, the promise of rediscovering lost humanity pushed her forward, each jump a leap into the unknown depths of interstellar space.
