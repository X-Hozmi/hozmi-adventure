
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map more faded than hope.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold ancient texts of untold power, fueled her journey.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of the Black Death that stalked the land.  Survival was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of Xylos, her crew faced not marauders, but cosmic anomalies and the chilling emptiness of interstellar space.  The quest wasn't for forgotten texts, but for a mythical energy source capable of powering civilizations for millennia.  The vastness of the cosmos, teeming with wonders and perils, presented an adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers, a struggle for existence on a galactic scale.
