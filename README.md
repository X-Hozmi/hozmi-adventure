
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their small caravan. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a city said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, each hardship a small price to pay for the promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of iridescent gas.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace on this interstellar voyage.  The thrill wasn't just in the breathtaking vistas of unexplored galaxies, but also in the unknown dangers -  uncharted wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light-years from any potential rescue. The cosmos beckoned, a vast, uncaring expanse ripe with the tantalizing possibility of discovery.
