
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched his worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a perilous route across the untamed wilds to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges facing him, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  The whispered legends of Eldoria's riches fueled his journey, a desperate hope against the bleak reality of his impoverished existence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, but the unknown dangers lurking within uncharted space were a constant concern.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of humanity's future on her shoulders, and the tantalizing possibility of alien life drove her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the cosmic ocean.
