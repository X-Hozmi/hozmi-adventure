
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood – a grim reminder of the bandit ambush just hours past.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura and claim the lost amulet of Amun-Ra, felt both thrilling and terrifying.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and untold riches.  The vast, unpredictable landscape of the medieval world was his battlefield, and survival his greatest reward.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the battlefield.  Captain Eva Rostova, her breath catching in her throat, gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Ahead, the swirling nebula of Xylos pulsed with vibrant colours and untold dangers.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances between planets, the unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates were challenges on a galactic scale.  The universe, however, held an allure far grander than any earthly kingdom.
