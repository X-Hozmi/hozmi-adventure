
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll detailing a rumored hidden monastery, said to possess ancient healing secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or the insidious whisper of the plague.  Yet, with every arduous mile, her resolve hardened, fueled by the desperate hope she carried for her ailing brother.  The journey promised hardship, but the potential reward far outweighed the risks.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, *The Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Faster-than-light travel offered shortcuts across unimaginable distances, yet the perils remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone vessels.  Jax held her course, driven by the weight of her duty and the faint, persistent signal emanating from the forgotten planet.
