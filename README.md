
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their mettle, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, a city said to hold secrets of unimaginable power, spurred them on, each sunrise a new chapter in their epic, land-bound adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and contending with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the dangers of the medieval age, but the human spirit's thirst for exploration remained, echoing across millennia.
