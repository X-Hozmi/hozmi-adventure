
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's battered retinue crested the hill, the sun beating down on their sweat-soaked tunics.  Before them stretched the seemingly endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched fields and shadowed forests.  Their journey to reclaim his ancestral lands was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the woods, feuding lords held sway over the passes, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to them like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance and courage, but the lure of home fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The journey was a blur of hyper-jumps and meticulously charted courses, punctuated by the ever-present hum of the Alcubierre drive.  While lacking the immediate, visceral dangers of Reginald's trek, Eva faced a different kind of adversity – the vast, unknowable emptiness of space, the constant threat of system failures, and the gnawing isolation that comes with charting humanity's destiny among the stars.
