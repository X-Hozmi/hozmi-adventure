
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the fractured lands of Aquilonia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and whispers of a plague stalked the settlements she passed.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, but the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient magic, pushed her ever forward. The hope of finding her missing brother fueled her onward, despite the ever-present threat of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Valerian piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to chart a course through unmapped space to the distant Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with dangers far beyond bandits and plagues.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and facing the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were everyday occurrences.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, and the promise of encountering new life and civilizations far surpassed any risk. The vast expanse of the cosmos was his playing field, a testament to humanity's unending quest for the new.
