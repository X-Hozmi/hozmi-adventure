
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory, as he pushed ever closer to his elusive goal, the weight of hope and desperation a tangible burden on his shoulders.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were commonplace hurdles in her journey across the vast expanse of the cosmos.  The solitude of space was a different kind of loneliness than Thomas knew, but the thrill of discovery, the vastness of possibility, fueled her drive as she pressed on towards the unknown.
