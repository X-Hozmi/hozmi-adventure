
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the biting wind, but the thrill of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold ancient magic, spurred her onward.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies were mere inconveniences compared to the promise of adventure that lay ahead, a tapestry woven with whispers of dragons, forgotten gods, and untold riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the unknown, fueling her relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of swirling gas and distant galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Prime, a whisper of a civilization swallowed by the void.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient star charts were all part of the cosmic odyssey, a journey as perilous and exhilarating as any medieval quest, but with the vast, unforgiving expanse of space replacing the unforgiving terrain of the old world.
