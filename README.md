
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, felt both exhilarating and terrifying.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of adventure – or death.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant companions on his perilous journey across the unknown reaches of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy painted breathtaking colours across her viewport as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vast emptiness of space held its own perils – unpredictable solar flares, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the allure of discovery burned brighter than any star in the cosmos.
