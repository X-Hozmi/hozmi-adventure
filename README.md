
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest had tested man and beast, but the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, propelled him forward.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers and rewards that awaited him on this perilous land-bound odyssey.  Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself were but minor obstacles in his quest for glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, held a different kind of peril than the Ardennes forest ever could.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and unknown alien entities lurked in the shadows of unexplored systems. Yet, the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled her journey, an intergalactic adventure that dwarfed even the grandest medieval quests.
