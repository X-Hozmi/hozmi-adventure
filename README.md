The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Aethelred from the clutches of the Black Baron, rumored to be hidden somewhere within the Baron's impenetrable fortress.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous terrain, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts lurking in the shadows of the ancient forest. The reward, however, was worth the risk.

Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, as it jumped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished centuries ago without a trace.

The vast expanse of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, but the hope of finding Xylos and unraveling its mystery fueled her unwavering spirit.
