
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her brother, lost somewhere in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both danger and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation all shadowed her journey, yet the lure of reunion spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of space.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a promising new colony world, was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But unlike Elara, Jax possessed technology that bent space and time, allowing her to traverse light-years in what felt like mere weeks.  The quest for a new home was far different, but the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly within her.
