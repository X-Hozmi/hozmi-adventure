
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous swamps teeming with unseen creatures, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of adventure in his eye burned brighter than any campfire, fueled by the promise of glory and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any rescue. But the allure of discovery, of charting unmapped galaxies and uncovering the mysteries of the cosmos, propelled her forward, a lone star navigating the infinite darkness.
