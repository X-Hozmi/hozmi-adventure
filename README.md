
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, but the journey was a gauntlet of treacherous forests, bandit-infested passes, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the desperate hope and gnawing fear that churned within him – the thrill and terror of the unknown in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship lurched violently.  The journey to the Kepler-186f colony had been fraught with unpredictable solar flares and navigational hazards, but the promise of new life on a terraformed world spurred her onward.  The vast, breathtaking expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the same intoxicating blend of adventure and peril that had driven explorers since the dawn of time, only now, the stakes were galaxies apart.
