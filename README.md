
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered stories of Zerzura, and the unwavering hope for her brother's recovery, spurred her onward, transforming every hardship into another step closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare energy source vital to the survival of her colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested her courage and skill daily. The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the tantalizing possibility of encountering unknown alien life fueled her journey across the cosmic ocean.
