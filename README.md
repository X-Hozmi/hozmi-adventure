
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cacophony of barking dogs and hawkers’ cries our last memory of civilization.  Now, weeks into our trek across the rugged English countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth is our constant companion.  Each dawn brings the daunting task of navigating treacherous bogs, avoiding brigands lurking in shadowed forests, and bartering for meager sustenance in sparsely populated villages.  The weight of our packs, filled with supplies and the ever-present fear of the unknown, is a physical manifestation of the adventure's relentless demands.  Yet, the promise of reaching the distant shores of the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a thirst for the extraordinary, keeps our weary feet moving.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a generation ship carrying humanity's hope, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  My great-grandchildren, born under the artificial sun of the ship's hydroponics bay, now navigate the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, charting unexplored systems.  The thrill of discovery isn't just about finding new planets; it’s about understanding the universe’s grand design, the echo of creation in the cosmic dust and the silent symphony of distant quasars.  The risks are immense – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, the ever-present threat of ship failure – yet the potential rewards, a new beginning for mankind, outweigh the fear.
