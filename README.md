
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, swallowed the hooves of his horse.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the legendary city;  each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a closer step towards fulfilling a destiny both thrilling and terrifying.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Each jump across hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life forms beyond human comprehension.  The vast emptiness of space, the constant hum of the engines, and the potential for encountering hostile alien races were all part of the journey.  The galaxy stretched before her, a tapestry of wonders and dangers, each star a potential destination, each nebula a potential graveyard.
