
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of ending a devastating plague sweeping across the kingdom.  Each sunrise brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a miracle.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of her ship.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming agents to a newly colonized planet on the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, measured in light-years, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive, the crackle of subspace comms, and the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Each jump was a gamble, each destination a leap of faith, but the promise of a thriving new world fueled her crew’s relentless pursuit of their distant goal.
