
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages, and constantly testing the mettle of both man and beast.  The glory of reaching their destination felt a distant glimmer against the harsh realities of the road.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  The journey was less about brute survival and more about managing complex systems, navigating asteroid fields with pinpoint accuracy, and dealing with the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  While the physical dangers were different, the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown and the unwavering determination to overcome obstacles, remained a constant throughout time and space.
