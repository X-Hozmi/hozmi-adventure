
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him on, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps risked catastrophic engine failure, alien encounters were commonplace, and the vast distances between planets tested both crew and vessel to their limits.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential for new knowledge, and the promise of reuniting a lost civilization propelled her forward into the uncharted darkness.
