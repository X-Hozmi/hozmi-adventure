
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead lies the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by mythical beasts and bandits more fearsome than any dragon.  His quest: to deliver a sacred relic to a distant abbey, a journey fraught with peril, where every bend in the road could conceal a deadly ambush or a desperate encounter. The rustling leaves and the shadows cast by the ancient trees are his constant companions, a symphony of both beauty and impending danger.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the volatile K'tharr system, a journey light years away and riddled with unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  The ship’s AI, a calm, reassuring voice, warned of approaching asteroid fields and solar flares, a different kind of danger, but just as deadly as a medieval ambush.  The vast emptiness of space, though breathtaking, held a constant threat of isolation and the unknown.
