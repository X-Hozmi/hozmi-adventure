
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, mud-caked track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered of in taverns and sung by wandering bards.  His journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of untold riches and adventure, spurred him onwards, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – both friendly and hostile.  The cosmos, vast and indifferent, held wonders beyond imagining, but also untold dangers. Yet, Elara, fuelled by a thirst for discovery and the legacy of generations of explorers, pushed onward, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking unknown.
