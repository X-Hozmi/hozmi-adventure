
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  Rumours of a hidden monastery, overflowing with ancient texts and untold riches, fuelled her journey.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of discovery, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden, unpredictable wormhole.  Faster-than-light travel was perilous, fraught with the risks of spatial distortions and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  But the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the mysteries behind the colony's disappearance,  outweighed the dangers, making the vast cosmic journey a necessary, and thrilling, undertaking.
