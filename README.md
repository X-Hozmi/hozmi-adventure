
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, spurred his mount onward.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in sun-baked canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance, forging him into something stronger than he'd ever imagined.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast, swirling colours painted the void outside her viewport as she jumped between star systems, charting new trade routes for the Galactic Federation.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies – the thrill of exploration burned just as brightly.  The universe was a tapestry of wonders and dangers, and Ryla, with her unwavering spirit, was determined to unravel its mysteries, one star system at a time.
