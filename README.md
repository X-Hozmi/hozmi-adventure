
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she spurred her horse onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of her resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance and cunning, pushing her closer to the legendary oasis and the secrets it held.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of space.  Navigating the treacherous Kepler-186f system, she dodged asteroid fields and navigated swirling nebulae, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile environment of her cockpit.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have mastered faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances and unpredictable anomalies of interstellar travel tested not only her piloting skills but also her crew's resilience, each jump a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of the cosmos.
