
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He’d traded his meager inheritance for a mule laden with questionable spices and a map promising untold riches in the far-off kingdom of Samarkand.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences in his quest for fortune and glory. Each sunrise brought new dangers and challenges, but the lure of the exotic East spurred him relentlessly forward, a solitary figure against a vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Advanced technology cushioned the dangers somewhat, but the vast emptiness of space and the unknown quantities it contained still held a terrifying allure. The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the promise of uncovering ancient secrets drove her across the uncharted cosmic sea.
