
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, guided his weary steed across the dust-choked plains.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy City, had already claimed several companions to fever and banditry.  Each sunrise brought the chilling uncertainty of what lay ahead: treacherous mountain passes, marauding armies, or the unforgiving emptiness of the vast, desolate landscape.  But the glint of faith in his eyes, and the whispered prayers of his remaining squire, fuelled his relentless drive towards his sacred goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval knight's limited horizon, offered different perils: solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  Yet, fuelled by the hope of discovery and the promise of a new beginning for humanity, Captain Rostova steered her ship onwards, a tiny vessel braving the infinite ocean of stars.
