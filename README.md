
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the unwavering hope fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, forging a path through the untamed wilderness of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting drone against the infinite blackness, speckled with distant nebulae and the pinprick lights of uncharted star systems.  Her mission: a first contact with a potentially hostile alien civilization on the edge of known space.  The risks were astronomical – unforeseen gravitational anomalies, pirate attacks from rogue corporations, and the ever-present fear of the unknown. But the potential rewards – establishing peaceful relations and expanding humanity's reach – were a beacon guiding her through the treacherous expanse of the cosmos.
