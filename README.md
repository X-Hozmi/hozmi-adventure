
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast, unforgiving distance still stretching before him. The journey tested not just his physical endurance, but his spirit, forging him into something stronger, more resilient, with every league conquered.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Nebulae shimmered like cosmic brushstrokes, and the cold, silent expanse of space pressed in on her.  Navigation through asteroid fields was a perilous dance, and the threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms was a constant, nagging worry.  But the lure of discovery, the hope of finding her lost kin, fuelled her relentless push forward, each warp jump a leap of faith into the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
