
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey from the bustling markets of Marseilles to the mysterious monasteries of Santiago de Compostela.  Her quest: to find a lost relic said to hold the key to healing her ailing brother.  The rough terrain tested her resilience, but the allure of her goal spurred her onward, fuelled by hope and a deep sisterly love.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a remote colony on the edge of known space.  Instead of bandits, she faced cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormholes.  Instead of starvation, it was the monotonous nutrient paste that tested her resolve.  The vast emptiness between planets, punctuated by the fleeting beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, presented a different kind of loneliness, but the promise of uncovering a forgotten alien civilization – and the potential riches it held – fueled her daring expedition across the interstellar void.
