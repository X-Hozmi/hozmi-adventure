
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the perilous journey. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by tales of fantastical treasures and the unwavering belief that the legend was true.  The road itself was an adventure, etched with the trials and tribulations of a medieval pilgrimage.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat considered impossible by most.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and wrestling with the unpredictable nature of warp travel were commonplace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the problems of a medieval journey, but the spirit of exploration, the drive to push beyond known limits, burned just as brightly within Eva as it had in Thomas all those centuries ago.
