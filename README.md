
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but the seed of a rare herb, a vital ingredient for a cure sought by the ailing Duke.  Bandits,  scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the vast and unforgiving lands of Francia. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of both fear and determination down her spine.  The Duke’s life, and her own livelihood, depended on her reaching her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers.  Warp drives hummed, the ship responding to her every command as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.   The galaxy, a breathtaking canvas of stars and cosmic dust, held both infinite wonders and perilous unknowns, but Eva, a seasoned explorer, faced the cosmos with a steely gaze and unwavering resolve.
