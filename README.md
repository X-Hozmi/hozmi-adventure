
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate plains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, amplified the dangers lurking in the unknown; bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation burned brighter than any fear, fueling her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. His mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and managing the volatile warp drive were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacefarer like Rexx.  But the vastness of space, the unimaginable distances, and the ever-present possibility of encountering the unknown – these were the true adventures that defined his life amongst the stars.
