
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Each craggy peak held the promise of both breathtaking vistas and mortal danger – bandits lurked in the shadows, and the unforgiving terrain threatened to swallow her whole.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled her onward.  The journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of beauty, promised a reward beyond gold – the truth behind the legend.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues painted across her viewport were a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.   But the promise of discovering new life on the Kepler-186f system, a planet potentially teeming with undiscovered species, outweighed the risks. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the key to humanity's future, a future Eva was determined to help shape.
