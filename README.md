The sun beat down on the cracked earth of the King's Road, the distant peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a harsh reminder of the perilous journey still ahead.  He carried the King's decree, a perilous mission to forge an alliance with the reclusive tribes of the Whispering Woods, a journey fraught with bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of mythical beasts.
