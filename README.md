
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the relentless landscape.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray I'd smelled just days before, when we left the coast.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold forgotten magic and untold riches, a destination that fuelled my weary body and the desperate hopes of my companions.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences on this holy quest.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant lullaby as we hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The starfields outside my viewport were a kaleidoscope of impossible colours, nebulae swirling like cosmic brushstrokes.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess knowledge that could save our dying planet.  The dangers now were of a different order – gravitational anomalies, pirate raiders in sleek void-ships, and the unnerving silence of deep space.  But the lure of survival, of discovery, kept us pressing onward, a tiny speck of hope against the vast, indifferent canvas of the universe.
