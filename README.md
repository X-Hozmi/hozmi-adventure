
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the creak of her worn leather saddle a constant companion.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping her homeland.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles she faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainty of her journey.  Her courage, however, burned brighter than the midday sun, fueled by hope and the desperate pleas of her people.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive a lullaby against the vast, star-dusted expanse.  His mission: to establish a vital trade route between the far-flung colonies of the Terran Federation.  Warp storms, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile species were commonplace hazards.  Yet, the thrill of exploration and the promise of galactic commerce spurred him on, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery.
