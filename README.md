
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes onward, her mule struggling beneath the weight of meager supplies.  The sun beats down on the cracked earth of the King's Road, a ribbon of grey cutting through an endless expanse of wheat fields and scrubland.  Her quest – to find the lost monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague – feels as vast and unforgiving as the landscape itself.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, yet the hope of salvation fuels her onward, pushing her across the unforgiving terrain of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, was perilous, pushing the ship's engines to their limits.  Now, navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy storms is the daily bread of a spacefarer.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, is a constant companion, a humbling reminder of the fragility of life and the boundless possibilities that lie beyond the known reaches of the galaxy.
