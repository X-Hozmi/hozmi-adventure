
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a tyrannical lord.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, whispered of potential peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise painting the sky in hues of gold and crimson, her determination burned brighter, fueled by the promise of a distant, safer land beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the vast tapestry of the cosmos swirling around her ship. Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable worlds for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile civilizations.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, eclipsed all fear, driving her onward into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the universe.
