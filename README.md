
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina rumored to hold a cure for her brother's illness, pushed her onward despite the biting wind and the gnawing uncertainty. The map, a tattered and incomplete thing, offered little solace against the vastness of the unknown.  Every sunrise brought a renewed battle against hunger, fatigue, and the ever-present fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily occurrence.  The vast distances between stars, measured in light-years, tested not only the ship's resilience but also his crew's patience and courage. The unknown, in this future age, held the same promise and peril as it did in the medieval world – the allure of discovery tempered by the ever-present threat of the void.
