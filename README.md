
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Ys, swallowed by the sea centuries ago, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered tales of forgotten magic and untold riches.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of discovery, the constant awareness of bandits and the unpredictable whims of nature a constant companion on her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of his ship.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space. But the lure of the unknown, the potential for unparalleled discovery, burned as brightly in his heart as the nebula blazed around him.
