
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the Pope, has led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed forests where brigands lurk.  Each sunrise brings fresh challenges – bandits to outwit, dwindling supplies to ration, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the glint of the relic in his saddlebag fuels his determination, a beacon of hope in the sprawling, uncertain wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  Millions of light-years separate her from Earth, a tiny blue marble now a distant memory.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of subspace communications and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a gamble of interstellar proportions.  The vast, inky blackness of space holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, yet the promise of discovery and the hope of reunion spur Eva onward, a solitary voyager on a journey that transcends even the wildest medieval dreams.
