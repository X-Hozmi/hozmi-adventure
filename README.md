
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  The sun beats down mercilessly, baking the earth to a hard, cracked crust.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the allure of Constantinople, a city whispered to shimmer with gold and spice, fuels our onward journey, a beacon against the endless horizon.  The whispered tales of its wonders and the promise of untold riches are more potent than any hardship.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged of shimmering alloys and powered by harnessed quasars, hurtles through the inky blackness of space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey is a symphony of calculated risk; navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational pulls, and enduring the psychological strain of prolonged isolation. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, of charting uncharted territories in the cosmos, outweighs the dangers, making each jump to hyperspace a thrilling leap into the unknown.
