
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the restless spirits within our company. We are bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold untold riches and even greater dangers. Bandits lurk in the shadows of the mountains, and the whispers of plague stalk us like phantom wolves. Every sunrise brings a new challenge, every sunset a precarious victory against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Our only compass is the unwavering determination to reach our destination, alive.


Centuries later, the stars are our canvas.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel of shimmering chrome and advanced alloys, navigates the nebula of Xylos.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and lost civilizations.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating; silent, except for the hum of the hyperdrive and the crackle of static on the comms.  We face cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of finding something new beneath the endless expanse of stars, fuels our every jump through hyperspace.
