
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and grime, pressed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on our backs as we navigated the treacherous, rutted track across the Breton countryside.  Each creak of our heavily laden cart, each snort from our exhausted horses, was a testament to the miles already conquered and the miles yet to come.  We sought the legendary city of Ys, whispered to lie hidden somewhere beyond the jagged peaks, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, our sleek starship, hummed a low thrum as it pierced the violet nebula, its trajectory charted for the Kepler-186f system.  Beyond the viewport, uncountable galaxies swirled in a breathtaking cosmic ballet, a stark contrast to the sterile, efficient interior of our ship.  Our mission: to locate and secure a rare energy source vital to the survival of our fledgling intergalactic federation, a quest as perilous and rewarding as any undertaken by medieval explorers before us.
