
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Sunstone monastery nestled high in the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, had already claimed two horses and tested their resolve to the breaking point.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation gnawed at their heels, but the promise of the Sunstone, a relic said to hold unimaginable power, fueled their weary steps. Every creak of their worn saddles, every rustle in the long grass, held the potential for peril or salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of nebulas and the cold, indifferent stars, offered a different kind of peril.  Engine failures, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors were constants, but the hope of finding survivors, or even uncovering the mystery of the storm's origins, kept the crew of the *Stardust Drifter* pushing forward into the uncaring void.
