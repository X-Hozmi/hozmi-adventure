
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  His journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a quest whispered in hushed tones across taverns, had been fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where the wind howled like a banshee, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road – each tested his resolve and pushed him to his limits.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, with its promises of untold riches and magical artifacts, burned brighter than any hardship.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal faint and distorted across the light-years.  The journey was a dance with the cosmos itself – navigating asteroid fields, dodging solar flares, and braving the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Though technology eased some burdens, the vastness of space, the isolation, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure were a different kind of hardship, testing the crew's courage and resilience as much as any medieval knight's.
