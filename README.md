
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by both brigands and mythical beasts.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the Duke of Burgundy, was perilous, demanding both courage and cunning. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, or death.  Survival depended on her wits, her horse's stamina, and the fickle kindness of strangers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The hyperspace jump had been brutal, the ship’s shields tested by rogue asteroids.  Now, navigating the planet's treacherous gravity wells and the unknown dangers lurking within the derelict station was her next challenge. The galaxy held infinite possibilities, but also immeasurable risk.  Only the brave, and the well-prepared, could hope to return.
