
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, had been fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation threatened to derail their quest at every turn. Yet, the glint of the setting sun on their worn armor fueled their determination; the legend of the Sunstone, and the promise of untold riches and glory, beckoned them ever closer to the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed the risk, driving Eva and her crew further into the uncharted reaches of space.
