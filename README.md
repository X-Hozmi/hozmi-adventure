For weeks he'd ridden, his quest a whispered legend – to find the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient magic.  Each sunset brought the threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present gnawing hunger, but the lure of the unknown fueled his weary body and resolute spirit.  He pressed on, his eyes fixed on the distant, shimmering horizon.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.

The potential discovery of new life, or perhaps even the remnants of a lost civilization, outweighed the immense risks – the vast unknown beckoned, promising untold wonders, or unimaginable horrors.
