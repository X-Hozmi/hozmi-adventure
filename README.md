
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat,  the nights were filled with the howl of wolves, and the treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve at every turn.  Yet, the whispered legends of miraculous healing at the papal court, coupled with the unwavering hope in her heart, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, the coordinates sketchy at best, but the promise of a lost civilization with unparalleled technological advancements spurred him on.  Hyperspace jumps were a gamble, leaving him vulnerable to rogue asteroids and the unpredictable currents of the cosmic sea.  But Razor, a seasoned spacefarer with a reputation for reckless daring, trusted his instincts and the worn-out charts he’d acquired on the black market – the thrill of the unknown, and the potential reward, was a siren song he couldn't resist.
