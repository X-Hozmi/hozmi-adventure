Whispers of a lost city, shimmering with forgotten magic, fueled his quest. Bandits, wild beasts, and treacherous terrain were mere inconveniences compared to the glory awaiting him, a glory that would etch his name into the annals of Camelot. Each creak of saddle leather, each snort from his weary horse, echoed the thrill of the unknown, a symphony of adventure played out against the backdrop of a medieval world teeming with danger and dreams.

Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a dance with the unpredictable forces of the cosmos. But the reward - securing Xylos and securing galactic peace – was worth the risk, even with the potential threat of pirate fleets and uncharted anomalies lurking in the inky blackness between worlds.
