
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the only sound the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional rasp of his own breath.  He carried a worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, promising riches and glory beyond the borders of his kingdom.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and starvation threatened at every turn, but the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon of his ambition, kept him pushing forward into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast tapestry of the cosmos.  Each jump between star systems was a gamble, a dance with unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien patrols. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylos crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years. The weight of galactic peace rested on her shoulders as she charted a course through asteroid fields and navigated the treacherous currents of interstellar space.
