
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rutted track barely visible beneath the relentless autumn rain.  Each creak of saddle leather and whinny of our exhausted mounts echoed the precariousness of our journey.  We were bound for the distant city of Prague, a whispered legend of untold riches and danger, our only guide a tattered map and the unwavering hope of finding fortune, or perhaps, simply, survival against the bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of disease that haunted the medieval roads.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  Our sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of interstellar space.  The swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy painted breathtaking canvases across our viewport, a spectacle dwarfed only by the sheer audacity of our mission:  to reach the fabled Xylos system, a legendary cradle of ancient civilizations, and uncover the secrets of a technology lost to time, a journey across unimaginable distances where the true adventure lay not just in the destination, but in navigating the cosmic expanse itself.
