
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her patched tunic.  Ahead lay the untamed expanse of the Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by goblins and worse.  Her meager pack held only dried meat, a waterskin, and the worn map her father had given her before his passing – a map promising a legendary city of gold beyond the shadowed trees.  Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, but the lure of adventure, of proving herself, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the Althea shuddering as it leaped across the void between galaxies.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The stars streaked past like cosmic fireflies, the vastness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  While the dangers were different – hostile alien life, treacherous nebulae, the ever-present threat of engine failure – the thrill of the unknown, the drive to push boundaries and discover the uncharted, remained the same primal force that had driven explorers since the dawn of time.
