
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him ever closer to the unknown, a tapestry of danger and desperate hope woven into the very fabric of his medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare energy source vital to the survival of the Sol Federation.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and braving uncharted nebulae were all in a day's work.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, but the weight of her responsibility, the hope of billions resting on her shoulders, propelled her forward into the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
