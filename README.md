
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the mud, the stench of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria and the hope it represents fuels their weary steps, driving them ever onward toward the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, her course charted for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in generations, a slow crawl across the vast cosmic ocean.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, navigate asteroid fields, grapple with alien technology, and face the chilling loneliness of interstellar space.  The promise of new worlds, new knowledge, and the chance to expand humanity's reach across the stars, keeps them focused on their daunting, centuries-long mission.
