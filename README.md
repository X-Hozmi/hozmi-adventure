
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and bread; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid clutched within.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, was a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  Her journey to the distant abbey was a gamble, a perilous adventure fuelled by unwavering faith and the strength born of necessity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and silent threats, dwarfed even the grandest medieval expedition.  While knights faced brigands, Eva navigated asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Both journeys, separated by time and technology, shared a common thread: the courage and determination of those who dared to venture beyond the familiar, facing unknown perils in pursuit of a distant hope.
