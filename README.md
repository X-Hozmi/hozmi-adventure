
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each bird of prey circling overhead, marked the passage of time and danger in this unforgiving landscape.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vast, unknowable silence of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue planets, and maintaining the delicate balance of the ship's life support systems presented challenges that tested the crew’s skill and courage.  The vastness of the cosmos held both wonder and peril in equal measure, a far cry from the medieval roads that once held adventure.
