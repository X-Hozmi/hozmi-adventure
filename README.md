
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth filling her nostrils.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea to the distant King for aid against the encroaching famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the landscape, represented a step closer to – or further from – salvation.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the splintered kingdoms.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship's frame, a stark contrast to the silent, breathtaking expanse of space outside.  But the cosmos held its own dangers; pirate factions lurked in the shadows, asteroid fields threatened to pulverize his vessel, and the very fabric of spacetime itself posed an unpredictable threat to his ambitious voyage.
