
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled her onward, her resolve hardening with every mile.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora.  Warp jumps sent jolts through the vessel, and the vast emptiness held a constant threat of unforeseen cosmic anomalies.  Alien landscapes, teeming with bizarre flora and fauna, awaited discovery on each newly-charted planet, each a testament to the limitless wonders and perilous unknowns of the cosmos.
