
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of encountering the mythical beasts said to haunt the untamed forests. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, forging their bond as tightly as the worn leather of their saddlebags.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space krakens of the Xylos system tested her piloting skills to their limits.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, instilled a sense of awe and loneliness unlike any experienced on Earth.  Yet, the hope of finding the lost colonists spurred her onward, a beacon in the cosmic darkness.
