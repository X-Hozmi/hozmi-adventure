
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains a fiery orange.  Her journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria, a quest to retrieve a stolen relic, has been fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown have tested her resolve, yet the glint of the promised reward, and a whispered prophecy of a hero's return, keep her moving forward. The scent of woodsmoke and the distant howl of a wolf are her constant companions in this vast and unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Stormbringer' Valerius pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a world said to hold secrets older than the Galactic Federation itself.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and enduring the endless monotony of hyperspace jumps is all in a day's work for Rexx and his crew.  But this mission is different. Whispers of an ancient, powerful being slumbering on Aethel add a chilling undercurrent to the already dangerous voyage.  The fate of the galaxy, it seems, rests on the shoulders of this grizzled spacefarer.
