
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the caravan as it lumbered across the parched plains, the midday sun beating down on Sir Gareth and his companions. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of King Solomon.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  The journey was a constant test of endurance, a dance between hope and despair under the vast, indifferent sky.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast distances were measured not in days, but in light-years, the dangers not bandits, but rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien civilizations – some perhaps friendly, others decidedly not.  The cosmos held both wonder and peril in equal measure.
