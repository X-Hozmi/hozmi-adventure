
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags as my horse, Bess, picks her way across the parched earth.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a daunting but necessary passage on my pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura. Rumours whisper of unimaginable riches and ancient magic within its walls, but the journey itself is a tapestry woven with peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of my courage and endurance.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant lullaby as we traverse the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos stretches before us, a breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns, yet the journey is fraught with its own unique dangers.  Cosmic storms threaten to rip our ship apart, while unknown alien entities lurk in the darkness between stars.  The adventure, though seemingly different from the medieval pilgrimage, demands a similar blend of grit, determination, and an unwavering belief in the journey's ultimate reward.
