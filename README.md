His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's malady.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the flickering torchlight, but the allure of Eldoria, and the king’s desperate need, fueled his relentless journey across the untamed lands.
