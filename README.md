
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in dusty taverns.  His journey had already claimed two pack animals and countless blisters, but the lure of untold riches and perhaps even magical artifacts spurred him on.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in the face of such a grand adventure.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace a generation ago.  Navigating through asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva.  The vastness of space held both terrifying and breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of her ship.  The hope of finding Xylos, and perhaps unraveling the mystery of their disappearance, fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
