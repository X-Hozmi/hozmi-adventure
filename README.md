
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Merlin.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of magic and ancient wisdom, propelled him relentlessly forward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos held a different kind of peril – hostile alien encounters, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to uncover the secrets of a lost civilization, outweighed the dangers.  The stars themselves beckoned, promising untold wonders and unimaginable challenges across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
