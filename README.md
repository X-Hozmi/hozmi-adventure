
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold secrets of untold power.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow him whole, and the endless expanse of desert tested his endurance beyond measure.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset the grim possibility of failure, yet the lure of Zerzura, whispered on the wind like a siren's call, kept him moving.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps risked tearing the ship apart, hostile alien patrols patrolled the star lanes, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at her crew. But the hope of finding survivors, of connecting with humanity's scattered past, fueled her resolve as she navigated the vast cosmic ocean.
