
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of the nearby forest, held the promise of both wonder and peril. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant companions on this arduous journey across the vast, untamed landscape. The whispers of Zerzura spurred him on, a beacon in the ever-present darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant stars and the occasional, ominous asteroid field, held its own unique brand of terror and excitement.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of a new dawn on a distant world fueled her journey across the infinite galaxy.
