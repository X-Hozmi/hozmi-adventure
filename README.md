
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onwards.  The journey across the unforgiving terrain of the Rhineland was proving brutal.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring rains, and the relentless sun beat down upon them mercilessly.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his horse, was a reminder of the perilous adventure that lay ahead – a quest to recover the stolen relic of St. Jude, a journey fraught with danger and uncertainty, yet fueled by unwavering faith and a thirst for glory.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unforeseen asteroid fields, the vast expanse of space a beautiful but unforgiving wilderness.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a perilous interstellar voyage demanding years of dedication and resilience.  The weight of responsibility for the crew rested heavily upon her shoulders, but the promise of discovery and the hope of finding life beyond Earth spurred her onwards.
