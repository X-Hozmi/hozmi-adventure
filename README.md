
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – a precious cargo destined for a monastery nestled beyond the unforgiving landscape.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were constant companions on her perilous journey across the splintered kingdoms, a testament to the bravery and resilience demanded of those who dared to traverse the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Kepler piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers was commonplace; the vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, held both wonder and peril in equal measure. The galaxy, a frontier of unimaginable scale, offered unparalleled adventure for those brave enough to explore its depths.
