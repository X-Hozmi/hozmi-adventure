
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the whisper of adventure, the lure of the unknown, spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of discovery, or perhaps, a swift and brutal end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos hummed with the energy of a thousand dying stars, a symphony of cosmic radiation and gravitational pulls.  Alien encounters, malfunctioning hyperdrives, and the ever-present threat of pirates were everyday hazards, but the allure of galactic exploration, the chance to chart unmapped territories and uncover the universe's secrets, fueled his relentless pursuit.
