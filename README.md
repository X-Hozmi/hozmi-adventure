The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a forest primeval, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent a jolt of apprehension through him; rumors of goblins and worse haunted these woods.

Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and retrieve the vital data hidden within its ancient archives.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, held its breath as she plunged deeper into the unknown.
