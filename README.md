
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it offered, spurred them on, their journey a testament to human endurance and unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit.  Her mission: to establish a colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of system failures were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested her crew's resilience and their bond, forging a camaraderie born from shared risk and the collective dream of a new beginning among the stars.
