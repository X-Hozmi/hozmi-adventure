
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of its hidden treasures and ancient magic fueled my weary body, outweighing the gnawing hunger and the constant threat of bandits and wild beasts. Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, promised either salvation or a swift, brutal end.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the bridge, a familiar lullaby as we leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling nebulae and distant starlight, dwarfed the petty dangers of my medieval ancestor's journey. Yet, the thrill was the same; a plunge into the unknown, a gamble against the odds, fueled by ambition and the insatiable human hunger for discovery.
