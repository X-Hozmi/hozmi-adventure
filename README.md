
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promises riches and adventure in the faraway city of Constantinople, but the path is fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threaten to claim both beast and rider, and the whispers of plague follow her like a chilling breath on her neck.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, but the allure of the unknown pushes her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  Asteroids the size of mountains threaten to crush her vessel, and the unpredictable gravity wells of uncharted star systems present a constant, terrifying challenge.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to rewrite the history of humanity's expansion among the stars, fuels her unwavering determination.
