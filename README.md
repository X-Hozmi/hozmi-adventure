
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague sweeping across the kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them forward, their determination etched on their weary faces.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement cut off from contact for decades.  Navigation was treacherous, charting a course through asteroid fields and navigating the gravitational pull of black holes.   The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, emphasized the isolation of their journey and the weight of their responsibility to find the lost colonists, however far they were flung across the cosmos.
