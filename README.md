
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel holding all she owned.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less frightening than the burning desire to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential adventure, a test of her resilience against the harsh beauty of the medieval world.  She carried not just supplies, but hope, riding toward an unknown future on a path paved with uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f colony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar freighter captain.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and swirling gas clouds, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  Eva, however, thrived on the challenge, her thirst for exploration fueled by the promise of discovering new worlds and the ever-present allure of the unknown.
