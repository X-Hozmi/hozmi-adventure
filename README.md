
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire was far from the romantic tales sung by bards.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of unknown dangers lurking in the dark forests and desolate mountains.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, hidden in a forgotten monastery, fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of his ship.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component for the Galactic Federation from the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, the unknown dangers of uncharted space a constant companion.  But the thrill of exploration, the vastness of the cosmos, and the lure of untold riches, outweighed the fear of the cosmic unknown, making every journey a breathtaking gamble.
