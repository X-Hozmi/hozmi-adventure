
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from bartering for meager meals in dusty villages to navigating by the stars in the vast, unforgiving wilderness. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged with fellow travelers, and the unwavering faith in her heart fueled her onward, making the hardship a small price to pay for the spiritual quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations.  But the allure of discovery, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the possibility of finding new life, propelled Eva and her crew through the inky blackness, their ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking grandeur of the cosmos.
