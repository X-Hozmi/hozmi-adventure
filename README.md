
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his horse onward.  The wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape of the Scottish Highlands, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind in France months ago. His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each nightfall a desperate scramble for shelter, yet the glint of the distant, snow-capped peaks fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of unknown space.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of intergalactic pirates was a daily occurrence.  The vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos offered a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of her ship, yet the unwavering hope of finding the colonists, and perhaps discovering new wonders, kept her engines humming and her spirit soaring.
