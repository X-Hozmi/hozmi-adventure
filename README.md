
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispers of magic and untold riches, fueled his relentless journey across the vast, untamed landscape of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust' across the yawning chasm of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to contain a planet capable of sustaining life beyond Earth’s failing biosphere.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, and facing the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters were just some of the perils she faced. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a lonely and unforgiving mistress, but the potential reward – a new home for humanity – made every risk worthwhile.
