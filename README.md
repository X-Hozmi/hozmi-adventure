
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, the weather unpredictable, and the very terrain itself – treacherous mountain passes and sun-baked plains – tested their resilience.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating dense forests where whispers of mythical creatures echoed through the trees, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages.  Their destination, a distant beacon of hope, seemed as far away as the stars themselves.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the looming threat of the Kryll, a sentient spacefaring species known for their ruthless territoriality.  The vastness of space, once a source of wonder, now felt suffocating, the galaxy a menacing ocean with the *Stardust Drifter* a tiny, fragile vessel struggling against its currents.
