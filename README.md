
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the relentless sun, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the knowledge that the journey was far from over, and the whispers of Zerzura remained just that – whispers. The rustling of leaves in the night, the distant howl of a wolf, all fueled the mystique of his adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia for slower vessels.  The ship, a marvel of futuristic engineering, hummed with the power of a collapsing star, its AI constantly monitoring the volatile energies surrounding them.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the occasional celestial anomaly, held both a breathtaking beauty and a terrifying potential for disaster. Every jump into hyperspace was a gamble, but the lure of the unknown propelled her forward, driven by a thirst for exploration that echoed the medieval adventurers of old.
