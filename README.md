
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any map could depict.  Each day was a gamble, a desperate push against the unforgiving landscape and the relentless march of time.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured in light-years and punctuated by the silent hum of the hyperdrive.  While dangers differed – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remained unchanged.  The vastness of space, no less daunting than the endless plains of medieval Europe, fueled her determination, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
