
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the plague that stalks the land.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull reflecting the nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes, she leads a daring expedition to a newly discovered planet, Xylos, whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The vast emptiness of space is both breathtaking and terrifying, the unknown dangers lurking in dark matter and uncharted systems a constant threat. But the lure of the unimaginable, the potential to unlock the secrets of the cosmos, drives her crew forward into the inky blackness.
