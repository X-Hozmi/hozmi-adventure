
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula. Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a priceless illuminated manuscript, her only protection against the bandits that infest the mountain passes and the scorching sun that beats down relentlessly. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sends a jolt of adrenaline through her, a stark reminder of the constant danger shadowing her quest to deliver the manuscript to the Abbey of Saint-Denis.  The journey is a test of endurance, a dance between hope and despair, played out against the breathtaking backdrop of a medieval world teeming with both wonder and peril.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey through uncharted space riddled with gravitational anomalies and pirate fleets.  The cold, sterile environment of her cockpit contrasts sharply with the vibrant imagery beamed onto her console – alien planets swirling with impossible colours, nebulae painted across the black void. While the risks are different, the intrepid spirit that fuels her quest echoes that of Elara, a testament to the enduring human desire to explore the unknown, whether on Earth or amongst the stars.
