
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest, promising both peril and the rumored riches of the lost Abbey of Saint Jude.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, the shadows playing tricks on his eyes.  Bandit ambushes, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured landscape of medieval Europe.  His quest, fuelled by a thirst for glory and the whispered tales of ancient power, tested not only his endurance but also his courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant reminder of the immense distances she traversed.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate incursions, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all part of a day's work for the intrepid explorer.  The galaxy was a vast and dangerous ocean, but the promise of discovering new worlds and civilizations kept her pushing forward, fuelled by a desire for knowledge and the thrill of the unknown.
