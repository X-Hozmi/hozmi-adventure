
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrill of the unknown, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present shadow of disease.  He carried more than a sword; he carried the hope of a kingdom.


Centuries hence,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new home for humanity. The journey, measured in light-years, was a tapestry woven with the hum of warp engines, the breathtaking spectacle of cosmic wonders, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue space pirates.  The vast emptiness of space held both a terrifying beauty and a profound solitude, but Eva, steeled by years of training and fueled by the hope of a better future, pressed onward, a lone star charting a course across the galaxy.
