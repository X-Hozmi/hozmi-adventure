
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the snow-covered Alps.  Each creak of the pack on my back, laden with meager supplies and a half-remembered map, echoed the uncertainty of my journey.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for my brother's illness, a city shrouded in myth and guarded by perilous passes and wilder folk. The sun dipped below the jagged peaks, casting long, ominous shadows that danced with the ghosts of travelers past.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cabin as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside were a breathtaking spectacle, but the true adventure lay in the uncharted systems beyond.  Our mission: to locate the legendary Xylos cluster, said to contain a mineral capable of solving the energy crisis crippling Earth. The vastness of space, however, held dangers beyond the known – pirate fleets, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of the unknown alien species rumored to inhabit the far reaches of the cosmos. Our journey was not just a quest for resources, but a leap into the cosmic unknown.
