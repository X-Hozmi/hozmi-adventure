
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a stark silhouette against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the King's decree, a parchment promising salvation – or death – at the far side of the continent.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, but also the chilling threat of bandit, beast, or the creeping, unseen menace of the plague.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the nebula’s shimmering veil, the twin suns of Xylos painting the cockpit in incandescent hues.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unknown.  Ancient, dormant spacefaring civilizations, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of navigational failure were the perils she faced, far removed from the terrestrial dangers of Elara's time, but equally, if not more, deadly in their own right.
