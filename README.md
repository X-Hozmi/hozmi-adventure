
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's summons had drawn him from his quiet village life, promising riches and glory in the far east.  His meager pack held only a few days' rations, a worn map riddled with inaccuracies, and a desperate hope of surviving the bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease that lay between him and his uncertain destination.  Each creak of his saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both excitement and a healthy dose of fear.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists and astro-physicists, held their breath, anticipating the challenges – and the breathtaking discoveries – that awaited them on the far side of the galaxy. The journey itself, a perilous dance with gravity wells and rogue asteroids, was as exciting as the planet itself.
