
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable challenge to our journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  We carried with us only our meager supplies, our unwavering loyalty to one another, and a burning hope for the treasures – and perhaps salvation –  that waited beyond the treacherous passes. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the elements were constant companions, making every sunrise a victory and every nightfall a prayer.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  My gaze drifted to the swirling nebula outside the viewport, a cosmic tapestry far beyond anything a medieval traveler could have imagined.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's burgeoning interstellar empire.  While dangers lurked – rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – the thrill of discovery far outweighed the risks. The cosmos, a boundless ocean of stars, beckoned us onward.
