
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease stalked his every step.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of exotic lands, fueled his weary limbs and hardened his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation, Eva pressed onward, driven by the insatiable human hunger for exploration and the promise of discovering new worlds teeming with life, or perhaps, terrifying unknowns.
