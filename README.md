
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse –  the unknown terrors that lurked beyond the familiar paths. His journey was a gamble against time, a test of endurance and faith, a desperate scramble across a fractured continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble with the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  Her journey was a testament to human ingenuity, a race against the unknown, a daring voyage across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
