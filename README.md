
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear; rumors of bandits and worse haunted the shadowed forests bordering the King's Road. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a reminder of the perilous journey that lay ahead, a journey fueled by desperate hope and unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, the nebula swirling outside her viewport a breathtaking canvas of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense; uncharted gravitational fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction. Yet, the promise of unlocking galactic exploration, of pushing humanity's boundaries further than ever before, spurred her on, a fiery spirit blazing against the cold expanse of space.
