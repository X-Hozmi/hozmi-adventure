
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the relentless sun, urged his weary horse onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, a stark contrast to the lush meadows promised in the King's decree.  His quest: to retrieve the legendary Sunstone from the hermit kingdom nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of never reaching his destination.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown vastness, fueled by a desperate hope to uncover the secrets hidden amongst the stars.
