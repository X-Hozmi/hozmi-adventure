
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to her homespun tunic.  Her journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, torrential rains turning the path to treacherous mud, and the ever-present gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed purpose, the whispered legends of Jerusalem fueling her weary steps.  The vastness of the unknown, the challenge of the unpredictable,  were the very essence of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a different rhythm. The journey to Kepler-186f wasn't measured in days or weeks, but in light-years, each jump a gamble against cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The galaxy was her medieval wilderness, a breathtaking expanse of wonder and danger.  But unlike Elara, Eva had the sleek technology of hyperspace and a starship, transforming the quest for the unknown into a thrilling, if slightly less physically taxing, adventure.
