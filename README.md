
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Robbers, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the unwavering hope of healing fueled her onward through the unforgiving landscape, each mile a testament to her courage and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, stranded near a newly discovered nebula teeming with unpredictable energy signatures.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and outsmarting cunning alien races were commonplace risks. The vastness of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that could swallow her ship whole.  Yet, the promise of discovery and the chance to bring home her lost compatriots drove her to push the limits of human exploration.
