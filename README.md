
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn map, more a collection of faded scribbles than a reliable guide, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's illness, a journey fraught with peril, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through her, fueling the flickering ember of hope that burned within her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic galaxy map shimmering around them.  Their jump to the Xylos system had been rough, throwing the crew of the *Stardust Drifter* against the bulkheads.  The prize, however: the legendary Kryll crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But Xylos was known for its unpredictable nebula storms and the fiercely territorial K'tharr, a reptilian species guarding their precious resource.  The risk was immense, but the potential reward, a revolution in galactic travel, made it a gamble worth taking for the intrepid crew.
