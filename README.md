
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rough Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled dangerously with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, a constant test of endurance and wit, but the whispered legends of the Apostle's tomb fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The breathtaking beauty of nebulas masking the deadly radiation was a constant gamble.  Wormholes, unpredictable and potentially catastrophic, were the only feasible shortcuts across the vast distances separating planets.  Each jump was a roll of the dice, a calculated risk against the crushing loneliness of interstellar space. Yet, the thrill of discovering new worlds, new species, and ancient alien ruins propelled her forward, fuelled by an insatiable curiosity that transcended the dangers.
