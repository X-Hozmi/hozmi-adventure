
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Abbey of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold the key to healing her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease formed a tapestry of peril woven into her journey.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the hope of salvation propelled her onward.

Centuries later,  Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of Kepler-186f already painting the viewport of his starship, *The Wanderer*. His mission: to establish first contact with the enigmatic Xylan civilization.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the vastness of the cosmos held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted sectors.  The galaxy was a boundless ocean of opportunity and peril, but for Jax, the unknown held an irresistible allure.
