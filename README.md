
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and dwindling supplies were constant companions, but the allure of the Sunstone, a jewel said to hold the power of the sun itself, fueled her onward. Each day brought a new challenge, from navigating dense forests teeming with wild beasts to bartering for food in isolated villages, forging alliances and facing betrayals along the way.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace centuries ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems amidst the void were daily occurrences. The vastness of space held both wonder and terror,  each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith, and each new planet a potential graveyard.  But the hope of finding Xylos, and uncovering the secrets of their disappearance, propelled Ryla and her crew across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
