
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel bulging with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was fraught with peril, from treacherous mountain passes to lawless villages, but the hope of a reunion spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, uncertain night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across lightyears to the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the low thrum of anxiety – a rogue asteroid field, a malfunctioning warp core, the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of uncharted space.  The promise of a new colony, a chance for humanity to expand beyond its cradle, was a beacon guiding her through the cosmic abyss, a journey infinitely more vast, yet strangely echoing the medieval pilgrimage of her ancestor, Elara.
