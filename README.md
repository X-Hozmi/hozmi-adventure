
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than her hopes of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the whispered legends of Eldoria's hidden treasures spurred her onward, fueled by a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the void. Yet, the promise of scientific discovery and the thrill of charting unmapped territories ignited a similar fire within Ryla, a burning ambition that echoed the adventurous spirit of those medieval travelers who came before her.
