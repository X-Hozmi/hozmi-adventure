
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandit ambush or the wrath of nature.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, was a testament to human ambition.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, and the hope of discovering new life made the risks seem almost insignificant compared to the boundless potential of interstellar exploration.
