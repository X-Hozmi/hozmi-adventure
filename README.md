Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the parchment map detailing her perilous journey to Avignon.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the promise of finding her lost brother fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of both fear and exhilarating hope.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Ahead, the twin suns of Kepler-16b cast a surreal glow on the approaching planet, a jewel-toned world teeming with alien flora and fauna cataloged only in whispered legends.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr patrols was a daily test of skill and nerve, but the potential riches – both scientific and material – within Kepler-16b’s atmosphere made the risks worthwhile.  The cosmos stretched before her, an infinite playground for those bold enough to explore its mysteries.
