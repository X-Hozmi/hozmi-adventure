
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unforgiving terrain tested their mounts and their resolve. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the sacred shrine, whispered to grant miracles, spurred them onward, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and fervent hope.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a newly-colonized planet on the brink of collapse.  The journey across galaxies was measured not in days but in years, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.   Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of space, a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of survival among the stars.
