
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her heels.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit, a single candle flickering against the vast, dark unknown.  Eldoria, they said, held the cure to her brother’s illness, a prize worth risking everything to attain.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and swirling gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers was a daily affair, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the universe, fueled her journey, driving her onward towards the uncharted territories that lay beyond the known galaxies.
