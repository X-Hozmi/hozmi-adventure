The rough-hewn track snaked through a seemingly endless forest, the only companions the incessant chirping of unseen birds and the gnawing fear of bandits lurking in the shadows.  Each rise offered a fleeting glimpse of the distant mountains, a beacon promising the end of his arduous journey to the Holy City, a pilgrimage fraught with peril but driven by unshakeable faith and the whispered promise of a miracle.

The galaxy was her playground, and fortune, or perhaps fate, awaited her.
