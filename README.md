
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping at my cloak as I navigated the treacherous Spine of the Dragon mountains.  Each step was a gamble – a misstep could send me tumbling into the icy chasm below.  My pack, heavy with supplies and the promise of a fortune in spices from the East, was my only companion on this perilous journey.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were ever-present threats, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the familiar, kept me pressing onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant, comforting thrum against the backdrop of the inky black.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the asteroid fields had been a white-knuckle experience, and the jump through the wormhole a dizzying sensory overload, but the breathtaking vista of nebulae swirling like cosmic brushstrokes made it all worthwhile.  The exploration of the unknown, the quest for new worlds,  remains as potent a siren's call as it was in the medieval ages, only the scale has expanded unimaginably.
