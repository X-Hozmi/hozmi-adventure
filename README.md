
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone from the treacherous Baron Malkor, rumored to reside in the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Reginald’s journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in darkened forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of adventure, the glory of knighthood, and the promise of the Sunstone’s power fueled his weary limbs.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile K'tharr warships, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day’s work for Eva and her crew.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the vast unknown and the incredible risks inherent in interstellar exploration.  The fate of a lost colony rested on their shoulders, a far cry from the simple quests of medieval knights, but no less a test of courage and skill.
