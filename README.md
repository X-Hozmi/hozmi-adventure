
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was far from the opulent pilgrimage tales whispered in the taverns;  bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, each sunrise brought a fresh surge of determination, fueled by the whispered promise of the Apostle's relics and the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rourke piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his cockpit.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking wonders and deadly alien flora.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But for Rexx, the cosmic expanse was home, and the thrill of discovery a worthy price for the risks involved.
