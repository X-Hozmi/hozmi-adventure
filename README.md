
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her mule, laden with meager supplies and the hopes of a desperate village, struggled onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse, the wildness of the untamed land a constant threat.  Yet, the promise of reaching the distant monastery, rumored to hold a cure for the devastating plague, fueled her onward, a flicker of hope against the bleak landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events made this journey infinitely more dangerous than any medieval trek, yet the potential rewards—a new era for humanity—spurred her onward, a brave captain charting a course into the unknown.
