
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary steed as she crests another windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin holds little against the chill, but the thrill of her quest—to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon—keeps her pushing onward. Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each flicker of a campfire at night, marks a step closer to her destination, a journey fraught with bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaps across the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae outside her viewport shift and swirl, a kaleidoscope of cosmic wonders far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers are different – radiation storms, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – but the spirit of adventure, the unwavering drive to explore the uncharted, remains the same powerful force propelling both Elara and Ryla on their respective journeys.
