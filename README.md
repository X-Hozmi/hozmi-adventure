
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a desperate hope that tomorrow would bring him closer to his goal, a testament to the unwavering human spirit in the face of medieval adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding hostile alien patrols, Eva relied on her advanced technology and crew's unwavering courage.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her journey and the ultimate gamble of humanity's expansion among the stars.
