
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, a far cry from my humble village.  Ahead lay a perilous journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered tales of ancient wisdom and untold riches.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by brigands, scorching deserts offering only meager shade, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every league covered, the thrill of discovery fueled my weary limbs, the promise of the unknown a potent elixir against despair.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of nebulae swirling in the void between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds and lost civilizations.  Each jump across light-years was a leap into the unpredictable, the potential for breathtaking wonders or catastrophic encounters equally probable.  But the vastness of space, a canvas of glittering stars and cosmic dust, held a magnetism that surpassed any earthly adventure I could have imagined.
