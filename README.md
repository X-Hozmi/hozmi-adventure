
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the endless road, and the ever-present fear of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispering tales of unimaginable riches and ancient knowledge, drives us onward. The dust-choked air carries the scent of sweat, woodsmoke, and the faint, hopeful aroma of spices from faraway lands, a testament to the perilous but intoxicating pursuit of adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The hum of the Althea's warp drive is a constant companion as we traverse the swirling nebula of Xylos, bound for the uncharted Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a power source said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The breathtaking cosmic vistas, the alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport, and the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unknown space anomalies fuel our relentless drive towards the unknown.  This is not just a journey; it's a leap into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
