
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I trudged across the snow-covered Alps.  Each creak of my pack was a reminder of the precious cargo within: scrolls detailing the rumored lost city of Eldoria, its location a cryptic riddle passed down through generations.  Wolves howled in the distance, a chilling symphony accompanying my perilous journey, a journey fuelled by ambition and a thirst for the unknown, a testament to the adventurous spirit that thrived even in the harsh realities of the medieval world.  

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The starfield outside shifted from a kaleidoscope of blazing suns to a void of inky black before resolving into a breathtaking vista of swirling nebulae and distant galaxies.  My mission: to establish a colony on Kepler-186f, a planet potentially habitable, but riddled with unknown dangers.  The vast distances of space presented a challenge far beyond any medieval adventurer could fathom, but the lure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning amongst the stars, propelled us forward.
