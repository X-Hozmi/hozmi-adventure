Bandits, scorching sun, and dwindling supplies were constant companions on her journey, but the whispers of lost knowledge and ancient magic within Zerzura's walls fueled her relentless trek across the unforgiving landscape.

The reward, however, was the chance to expand the frontiers of human exploration, to find new worlds and forge new destinies among the stars.
