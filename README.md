The rutted track, barely a path through the whispering forest of Eldoria, offered little comfort.  Ahead lay the rumored Sunken City of Ys, a legendary metropolis swallowed by the sea centuries past, and Reginald, driven by a thirst for glory and a tattered map, was determined to find it.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the growing thrill of the unknown, a stark contrast to the familiar dangers of bandits and wild beasts he already knew well.

The hum of the hyperdrive, a constant, low thrum, was the soundtrack to their daring expedition into the uncharted cosmos, a journey far removed from the familiar, safe orbits of known space.
