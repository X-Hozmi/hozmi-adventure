The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape, a ribbon of ochre snaking between towering mountains and parched plains.  Each creak of his saddle, each clang of his armor, echoed the perilous nature of his journey: a quest to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Aethelred, a quest that had already seen him outwit brigands, brave treacherous mountain passes, and endure weeks of meager rations.
