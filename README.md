
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed on, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their journey across the ravaged lands of Albion was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous bogs threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the blighted land, fueled their weary steps.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a desperate prayer for survival.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the pathways.  Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the unpredictable nature of wormholes a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the cosmic dance.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
