
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of wild beasts are a constant companion on her journey from the ravaged north to the rumored haven of a southern kingdom.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, rushing rivers, and the ever-shifting alliances of the villages she passes through.  Her quest, a desperate search for a cure for her ailing brother, fuels her weary legs and strengthens her resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific discoveries.  But the vastness of space holds its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, and each new planetary system presents its own unique challenges.  Ryla's crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, is her family, their bond tested by the perils of interstellar travel and the lure of the unknown.
