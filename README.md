
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue crested the hill, the sun beating down on their worn leather and chainmail.  Before them stretched the unforgiving expanse of the  Rhine Valley, a tapestry of dense forests, treacherous rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day was a gamble against starvation, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature, a test of their courage and resilience against the untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a planet light-years from their homeworld.  The journey was punctuated by asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the constant threat of pirate raids –  perils far different, yet equally deadly, compared to those faced by medieval travelers. The vastness of space, however, held a certain allure, a promise of discovery that spurred them onward.
