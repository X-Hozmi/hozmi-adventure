
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumours that swirled around his quest – a hidden monastery rumored to hold a relic of immense power, nestled deep within the treacherous Black Forest.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even his most ambitious dreams, and the potential rewards of his galactic expedition were far outweighed by the incredible risks involved.
