Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to swallow unwary travelers whole, and beyond that, the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Her quest, to find the legendary Sunstone and save her village from a creeping blight, pushed her ever onward, despite the gnawing hunger and the shadows lengthening in the ancient forests.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or peril.


Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr cruisers was a daily challenge, but the allure of unlocking interstellar secrets, and perhaps even galactic unity, fueled their daring expedition.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held infinite possibilities, yet every jump through hyperspace held the risk of a catastrophic malfunction or unexpected ambush.
