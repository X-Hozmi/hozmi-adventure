
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her meager possessions bundled tightly behind her.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a haven of learning and magic.  The journey was perilous, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glint of Eldoria’s mythical spires in her mind, fuelled by tales from wandering scholars, kept her spurred onward, through forests haunted by wolves and across rivers swollen with spring melt.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous currents of intergalactic space, she and her crew faced cosmic storms that threatened to tear their ship apart and the silent, isolating vastness that stretched for light-years in every direction.  The reward?  A newly discovered planet, Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a discovery that could reshape the galactic order, if they survived the journey.
