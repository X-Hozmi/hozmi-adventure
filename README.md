The dusty track, barely a trail in places, snaked through the unforgiving landscape of the Dornish marches.  Each rise offered a breathtaking vista – rolling hills dotted with ancient ruins and the shimmering mirage of a distant oasis – but also the potential for ambush.

But the promise of discovering new life, of charting unmapped territories in the vast expanse of the galaxy, made the risks worthwhile. The future, she knew, lay among the stars.
