
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Each sunrise brought a new vista: rolling hills giving way to dense forests, then stark mountains piercing the stormy sky.  My journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed glens, and the ever-present threat of sickness shadowed every step.  But the camaraderie of fellow travelers, the breathtaking beauty of the landscape, and the promise of spiritual solace fueled my weary legs.  This was not merely travel; it was a test of faith, endurance, and the human spirit.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Staring out at the swirling nebulae, I felt a kinship with those medieval pilgrims, a shared sense of awe and vulnerability in the face of the vast unknown.  But instead of bandits, we faced cosmic storms; instead of sickness, equipment malfunctions threatened our mission.  My destination was Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, a potential new home for humanity.  The risks were immeasurable, the journey arduous, but the potential reward – a new beginning – was worth every warp jump, every moment of terrifying silence between stars.
