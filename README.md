
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the only sound the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the hope of salvation spurred him on, transforming the arduous journey into a desperate, exhilarating race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos offered a different kind of peril –  uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Advanced technology mitigated some risks, but the sheer scale of the universe, the unimaginable distances between stars, and the loneliness of deep space tested her resolve as profoundly as any medieval knight's journey across the unforgiving land.
