
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's writ, a sealed scroll clutched tight in his hand, promised riches and glory in the fabled East, but the reality was dust, relentless sun, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed valleys.  Each creaking wheel and snort of his weary beast marked another mile on a perilous journey across a continent teeming with danger and the unknown – a pilgrimage for fortune, or perhaps just survival.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been rough, the warp drive shuddering under the strain of traversing uncharted space.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists and ex-military, were equally weary, the thrill of galactic exploration tempered by the constant threat of pirate attacks and the ever-present hum of the ship’s life support.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony, a needle in the vast haystack of the cosmos.
