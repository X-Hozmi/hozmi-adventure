
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders fueled his weary steps, each mile a victory against the unforgiving landscape and the gnawing doubt within.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal faint as a whisper across the light years.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the constant hum of the ship’s failing hyperdrive.  But the hope of finding survivors, of connecting humanity to its forgotten past, propelled her across the vast emptiness of space, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
