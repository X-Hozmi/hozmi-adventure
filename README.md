
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains, mocking his weary progress.  For weeks, he'd traversed treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers swollen by spring rains, and dodged the covetous eyes of bandits lurking in every shadowed copse. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone explorers.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, but the potential discovery of new life spurred Eva onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
