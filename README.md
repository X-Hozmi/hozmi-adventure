
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest was far from over; rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her relentless pace.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were small prices to pay for the chance to find glory and fortune, a gamble worth taking even if it meant facing the unknown with nothing but her wits and a rusty sword.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky black of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, rumored to hold a planet with life unlike anything encountered before.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet the vastness of space still held a palpable sense of awe and danger.  Unpredictable nebulae, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were constant companions on her interstellar odyssey, a thrilling adventure in a universe brimming with the unimaginable.
