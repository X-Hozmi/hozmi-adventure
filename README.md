
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey from York to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for food in unfamiliar villages, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers.  Yet, the unwavering pull of Jerusalem, the whispered promise of redemption and adventure, kept his weary feet moving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light years.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the occasional crackle of static from distant civilizations.  The risks were different now – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. But the allure of discovery, the uncharted expanse of the cosmos, fueled her intrepid spirit, mirroring the same thirst for the unknown that drove Thomas centuries before.
