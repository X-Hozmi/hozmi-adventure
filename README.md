
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their mission: to reach the distant monastery of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each step was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease, their journey a tapestry woven with peril and the unwavering hope of salvation. The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, making the already arduous path seem even more daunting.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital genetic samples from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially hostile life.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was child's play compared to the daunting task of deciphering the alien ecosystem and securing the samples before their oxygen recyclers gave out.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and its inherent risk.
