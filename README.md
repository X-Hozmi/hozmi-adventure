
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pushed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep with each step.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara nestled in the heart of the Whispering Mountains, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were commonplace, the forests teemed with wild beasts, and the unpredictable weather threatened to bury them alive under a blizzard. Yet, the glint of the distant peaks, a promise of both salvation and adventure, fueled their weary steps. Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of the unknown, a thrilling mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast nebulae painted the viewport in swirling colours, as they jumped between galaxies, charting unexplored regions of the cosmos.  The dangers weren't bandits or blizzards, but rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone vessels.  The siren song of the unknown, however, remained the same.  The allure of discovering new worlds, strange alien life, and lost technologies spurred her onward, a modern-day knight errant seeking fortune and glory amongst the stars.
