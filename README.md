
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crested the hill.  Ahead lay the vast, untamed forests of Arden, whispered to be haunted by mythical beasts and treacherous brigands.  Her quest: to reach the distant city of Porthaven, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of Barnaby's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a symphony of uncertainty accompanying their arduous journey across the medieval landscape.  Every sunrise held the promise of both peril and progress, a constant negotiation between survival and hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden, catastrophic wormhole event.  Navigation was perilous, charting a course through unmapped sectors of the galaxy, dodging asteroid fields and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.   Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, fueled by the faint hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of Kepler's disappearance. The vast emptiness of space amplified both the loneliness and the immense scale of her undertaking.
