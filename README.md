
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of weary camels and sweating horses, creaks across the sun-baked sands towards Samarkand.  Each dune holds the promise of danger – bandits lurking in the shadows, mirages mocking our thirst, and the ever-present threat of sandstorms that could bury us alive.  Yet, the allure of the legendary city, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the known world, fuels our relentless journey.  The scent of spices on the desert wind, the vibrant stories shared around crackling fires at night, and the camaraderie forged in the face of adversity – these are the treasures more valuable than any silks or jewels we hope to find.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of faster-than-light travel, cuts through the inky blackness between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Our mission: to chart unmapped nebulae, searching for habitable planets amidst the cosmic dust.  The thrill of discovering a new world, teeming with alien life both wondrous and terrifying, outweighs the risks of encountering rogue asteroids or encountering hostile alien civilizations.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile place amongst the infinite wonders – and dangers – of the cosmos.
