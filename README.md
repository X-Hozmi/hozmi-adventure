
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of London, the stench of sickness and poverty clinging to our ragged clothes.  Ahead lies the sun-baked dust of the Silk Road, a path paved with peril and promise. We’ll brave the treacherous passes of the Himalayas, the scorching deserts of Arabia, and the lawless steppes of Central Asia, all in pursuit of the mythical city of Shambhala.  Every bend in the road holds the possibility of bandits, disease, or starvation, but the whispered legends of unimaginable riches and sacred knowledge fuel our weary steps.


Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive as we slingshot between nebulae, the swirling cosmic dust painting vibrant streaks across the viewport. Our destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery light years from the settled colonies.  We are explorers, charting unmapped galaxies and encountering alien life forms both benevolent and hostile.  The vastness of space holds both exhilarating freedom and terrifying unknown dangers, the fragile metal hull of our ship our only shield against the cold emptiness.
