
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elias, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his mule onward.  The midday sun beat down relentlessly on the parched landscape, the only respite the occasional meager shade offered by stunted olive trees.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine hidden deep within the treacherous Black Mountains, seemed a fool's errand, but the whispered promise of healing for his ailing sister fueled his weary legs. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the scrub, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the unknown dangers of a land barely mapped and scarcely tamed.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the colossal distances she traversed.  While the dangers were less immediate than bandits, the cosmic unknowns were far more terrifying.  Asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters demanded constant vigilance. Yet, the lure of discovery, of charting the uncharted expanse of the galaxy, propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer navigating a sea of stars.
