
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, a testament to countless creases and tear repairs, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were less alluring promises, but Elara, driven by a fierce spirit and a thirst for adventure, pressed on, her heart pounding a rhythm as relentless as her journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Kestrel piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of a long-lost civilization.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a dance with the unpredictable energies that could tear a ship apart. But the allure of uncovering forgotten knowledge, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fuelled Nova's courage. The vastness of space, with its infinite possibilities and terrifying unknowns, was a challenge she eagerly embraced.
