
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Fiacre, had become a desperate scramble for survival.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease haunted their every step.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the chilling isolation of the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the whispered promise of miraculous healing spurred them onward, their determination fueled by faith and a shared thirst for adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to tear their ship apart, hostile alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the weight of loneliness in the vast emptiness of space pressed heavily on the crew.  But the hope of reuniting with long-lost kin, and the lure of the unknown, pushed them ever further into the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
