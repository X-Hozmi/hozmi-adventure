
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each step was a gamble, the biting wind a constant threat.  Ahead lay the promised riches of the East, whispered tales of silk and spices fueling my weary body.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present risk of falling to my death were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown. This journey, fraught with peril, was my destiny.


Centuries hence, my descendants piloted the starship *Odyssey*, a silver needle piercing the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, uncaring emptiness of space.  We sought not gold, but knowledge –  a forgotten civilization on the edge of known space, its secrets guarded by swirling nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields.  The risks were different, the dangers perhaps even greater, but the thirst for discovery burned just as brightly in our hearts.
