
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, rode towards the distant, snow-capped peaks.  Their quest: to retrieve the lost relic of St. Brigid, rumored to be hidden within a forgotten monastery clinging to the mountainside.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any mythical beast, testing their courage and resilience with every league they traversed across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new obstacle to overcome in their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy, before the Kryll Empire could seize it.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading Kryll patrols, and repairing critical systems under constant threat of cosmic radiation, Elara and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  The vastness of space, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying emptiness, offered both awe-inspiring vistas and deadly challenges at every turn.
