
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked plains of Anatolia stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of a desperate journey to Constantinople, a quest to find her estranged brother amidst the whispers of plague and the looming threat of war.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and unexpected encounter, making every mile a gamble on her survival and the success of her mission.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with dangers ranging from pirate attacks to unpredictable wormholes. The vast emptiness of space, while beautiful, was unforgiving; every jump through hyperspace was a calculated risk, a test of both his piloting skills and the ship's integrity in the face of unimaginable distances and unpredictable celestial phenomena.
