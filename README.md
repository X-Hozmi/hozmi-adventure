
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests where outlaws and wild beasts prowled. Each sunrise brought new dangers, from bandit ambushes to the ever-present threat of starvation, but the fierce hope in his heart spurred him on, fueling his every step towards a potential salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light-years from Earth and shrouded in alien mysteries.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien technology were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and unimaginable wonders, held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns, making every jump through hyperspace a gamble on the edge of the known universe.
