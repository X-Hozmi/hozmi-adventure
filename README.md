
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the disease itself were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the hope of salvation propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the crimson light of its dying sun.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the insidious effects of prolonged hyperspace travel were all in a day's work for Razor.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space offered a different kind of danger, a lonely battle against the infinite, but the thrill of exploration – the possibility of discovering something new and extraordinary – fueled his every jump to warp speed.
