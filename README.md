
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crest a windswept hill.  Ahead lies the untamed wilderness separating her village from the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of Barnaby's saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the promise of adventure – and danger.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation accompany her on this perilous journey across uncharted lands, her only companions the stars and the unwavering hope in her heart.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Cluster, said to contain resources vital to the survival of her people.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll Raiders, a ruthless spacefaring empire, Ryla pushes her ship and her crew to their limits.  The vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the immense distances and unimaginable dangers she must overcome to reach her destination and secure the future of her civilization.
