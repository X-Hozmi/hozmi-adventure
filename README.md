
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, but the path was treacherous, fraught with bandit-infested forests and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain trails, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and facing down the ever-present fear of the unknown. The thrill of the journey, however, outweighed the hardship; the promise of discovery fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck against the backdrop of infinite cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, had been risky, pushing the Althea's hyperdrive to its limits.  Ahead lay the challenges of establishing a foothold on an alien world, facing unknown flora, fauna, and possibly, other sentient life. Unlike the medieval traveler, Ryla had technology on her side, but the vastness of space presented its own unique brand of peril; a single malfunction, a rogue asteroid, or an unforeseen cosmic event could mean the end of the mission, and possibly, their lives.
