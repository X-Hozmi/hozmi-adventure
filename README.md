
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  Days bled into weeks as they traversed the treacherous, mud-caked tracks of the Holy Roman Empire, a tapestry of bustling market towns and desolate forests. Each sunrise brought the chilling possibility of bandit ambushes or the gnawing fear of starvation, yet the lure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to lie hidden in the Eastern mountains, fuelled his relentless journey.  The clatter of hooves on stone, the creak of saddle leather, and the constant companionship of his loyal squire were the only constants in a landscape as shifting and uncertain as the political tides of the age.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the jump to Xylos's outermost system still presented challenges: unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the promise of the Xylossian artifact, rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel, spurred her onward, the cold hum of the engines a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving beauty of the universe she dared to explore.
