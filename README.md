
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Our journey from Bordeaux to the Holy Land has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with rain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings renewed hope, but also a fresh wave of uncertainty; will we reach our destination, or will we become another tale whispered around crackling fires, a cautionary legend of those who dared to challenge the unforgiving path?

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The Althea, our generation ship, hums a low song as it navigates the nebula, a swirling canvas of cosmic dust and gas. Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven amongst the stars.  The journey has spanned generations, our lives lived in the rhythmic pulse of the ship’s systems.  We are pioneers, venturing into the unknown, carrying the legacy of humanity beyond the cradle of Earth, towards a future unwritten amongst the glittering expanse of the cosmos.
