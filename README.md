
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The vastness of the unknown, however, fueled their determination, promising glory and salvation if they could only persevere.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery.  Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond those of any medieval knight – rogue black holes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of ship failure in the unforgiving expanse of space. The vastness of the cosmos, however, held a similar allure to the medieval plains;  a thrilling promise of discovery and the unknown, a testament to the human spirit's endless pursuit of adventure.
