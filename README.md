
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward. The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving Black Forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of brigands, wild beasts, or worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Alaric, a journey fraught with peril, but one he would undertake for the glory of God and the salvation of his kingdom.  The biting wind and looming shadows were small price to pay for such a holy mission.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown.  Alien lifeforms, unexplored spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure loomed large as she charted a course through the uncharted cosmos, a solitary voyager driven by the relentless human desire to explore the vastness of space and discover what lay beyond.
