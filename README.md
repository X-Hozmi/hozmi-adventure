
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the mythical city of Eldoria, a journey whispered of in hushed tones.  Bandit trails, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere trifles compared to the legend of Eldoria's healing spring, her only hope for her ailing brother. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuelled a potent mix of fear and determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate patrols, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Ryla.  Her quest: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vast, inky blackness of space held both wonder and danger, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and the ever-present risk of the unknown.
