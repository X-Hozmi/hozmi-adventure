
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadowed depths – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting drone against the vast, inky blackness punctuated by distant stars.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate fleets were commonplace hazards on her perilous journey, but the thrill of discovery, the potential to find life beyond Earth, fueled her unwavering determination.  The galaxy was her playground, and the unknown, her ultimate reward.
