
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's wonders, and the desperate hope in his heart, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and countless uncharted systems.  While lacking the immediacy of bandits and starvation, the dangers were no less real – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the constant threat of equipment failure in the vast emptiness of space.  But Elara, driven by a sense of duty and the faint signal whispering from the lost colony, pressed onward into the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
