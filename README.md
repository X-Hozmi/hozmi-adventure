
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just supplies; it holds a king's ransom in the form of a stolen map promising a hidden monastery said to hold untold riches.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the tall grasses, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present shadow of the Hundred Years' War.  Survival hinges on her wit, her strength, and a desperate hope for fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of the dying star painting their sleek starship in an ethereal glow.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be guarded by sentient flora and unforgiving terrain.  Warp drives hum, the ship groaning under the strain of interstellar travel as Jax scans the star charts, his crew relying on his experience and cool head to bring them home.  The cosmos holds infinite possibilities, but also infinite dangers.
