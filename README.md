
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to recover the stolen reliquary of Saint Fiacre, a perilous journey fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, fueling the desperate hope that fueled his onward push towards the rumored hiding place of the thieves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a distant galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day's work.  The vast, silent expanse of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant stars and the hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of terror than any forest could offer, but the thrill of exploration burned as brightly as ever.
