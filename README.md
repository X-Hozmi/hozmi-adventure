
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his destrier across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to recover the lost relic of Saint Fiacre, rumored to be hidden within the treacherous Serpent's Tooth mountains.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey, testing both his courage and his resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new peril to overcome, as he pressed ever closer to his elusive goal, the weight of his kingdom's fate heavy upon his shoulders.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a vital trade run between the distant worlds of Kepler-186f and Proxima Centauri b.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems mid-jump were all in a day's work for the seasoned captain and her crew.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the incredible distances she traversed for the sake of galactic commerce.
