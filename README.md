
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting reminder of the unforgiving landscape. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, was her only guide to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable terrain itself were constant companions on her journey, but the lure of Eldoria, and the stories of its untold riches, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like Eva. The vastness of the cosmos, the breathtaking sights of alien planets, and the thrill of discovering new worlds were far more rewarding than any earthly treasure. The unknown stretched before them, a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, danger, and limitless possibility.
