
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He carried a king's pardon, clutched tight in his sweat-stained hand, and a heart full of trepidation.  His journey to the distant city of Avignon, to plead his case before the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the plague stalked the villages, and every river crossing felt like a gamble against the relentless current.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a stark reminder of the unpredictable and often brutal nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and charting unknown wormholes was routine, but the loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was also a lonely expanse, demanding unwavering focus and the unwavering hope that the discoveries waiting at their journey's end would justify the risks they took.
