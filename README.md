
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping my cloak around me as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, a destination fueled by tales spun in smoky taverns and desperate prayers to fickle gods.  Each step was a gamble against the elements, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the thrill of the unknown spurred me onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Unlike the medieval treks of my ancestors, the dangers were less tangible – cosmic radiation, hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  Yet the pull of the unknown remained the same, a human thirst for discovery pushing us across the void, the vast, inky expanse our new unforgiving landscape.
