
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked road as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome was a treacherous one, fraught with bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the intoxicating allure of the unknown –  a bustling foreign marketplace, a crumbling castle steeped in legend, the whispered secrets exchanged between weary travelers around a crackling fire. His quest for the rumored lost relic fueled him, making the hardship worth enduring.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days but in months, a silent odyssey punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional meteor shower.  But unlike the medieval traveler's limited horizons, Eva’s voyage stretched across unimaginable distances,  each star a potential waypoint to a new civilization, a new challenge, a new adventure among the cosmos. The vast unknown held not just peril, but the thrilling possibility of discovery beyond human comprehension.
