
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World, a jagged mountain range separating my homeland from the rumored Silk Road's eastern terminus.  Each step was a gamble against frostbite and bandits, the biting wind a constant companion.  My meager pack held only the essentials: dried meat, a waterskin, a worn map, and the unwavering hope of finding fortune, or at least, survival, in the distant lands beyond. The distant peaks, shrouded in mist, held both the promise of untold riches and the chilling reality of certain death.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was the only sound louder than the pounding of my own heart.  We hurtled across the void between galaxies, a tiny speck in the unfathomable immensity of space.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The risk was astronomical – Xylos was known for its volatile atmosphere and aggressive indigenous lifeforms – but the potential reward, a revolution in interstellar travel, was worth the gamble.  The starfield outside, a swirling tapestry of cosmic dust and distant suns, both awed and terrified me.
