
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape, a ribbon of brown snaking between sun-baked hills.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey's success; yet, the hope of salvation fueled his weary bones and spurred him onward through the wild heart of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light years beyond known space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate squadrons, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal distortions, Eva’s journey was a constant test of skill and courage. The vast emptiness of space was a stark contrast to the familiar comforts of Earth, yet the allure of the unknown, and the knowledge she could save billions, drove her and her crew relentlessly forward.
