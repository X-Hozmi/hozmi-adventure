
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, depicting a rumored hidden monastery said to hold the secrets of alchemical immortality.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils awaiting him on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his dogged determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with exotic, and potentially deadly, life forms.  Warp drives hummed, pushing them across unimaginable distances, while the galaxy itself blazed with a breathtaking, and somewhat terrifying, beauty.  Her journey was not across miles of earth, but light-years of interstellar space, fraught with dangers both natural and, perhaps more worryingly, alien.
