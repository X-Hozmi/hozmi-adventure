
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a city of gold and magic.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the towering peaks, and the biting cold threatened frostbite at every turn, but the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of untold riches and adventure, fueled her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each crunch of rock beneath her horse's hooves, was a heartbeat in the rhythm of her daring quest.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet of Aethel, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by formidable alien lifeforms.  The jump to hyperspace had been harrowing, a brief moment of terrifying nothingness before the kaleidoscope of colours and swirling galaxies resolved into the ethereal beauty of Aethel’s twin moons.  The adventure promised unimaginable riches, technological marvels, and the thrill of facing the unknown in the vast expanse of the cosmos.
