
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a perilous route across the war-torn kingdom.  Rumors of a lost monastery, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fuelled his journey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sparked a frisson of fear and excitement.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a stark contrast to the breathtaking cosmic vistas unfolding outside her cockpit.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration, the unknown stretching before her, mirrored that felt by medieval travelers centuries past.  The human spirit, it seemed, was ever drawn to the edge of the map, wherever that might be.
