
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful Baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the distant, promised land fueled her onward, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of both danger and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of cryo-preserved Xenoflora to the distant colony of Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic wonders and perilous asteroid fields, held a different kind of threat – radiation storms, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  But the promise of a hefty reward, and the thrill of charting unknown territories, pushed him ever forward amongst the glittering, uncharted expanse.
