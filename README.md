
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar terrain to bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages. But the allure of the exotic East, the whispers of Byzantine splendor, fueled her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and encompassing unimaginable wonders.  The ship's AI, a reassuring voice in the vast emptiness, warned of gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields.  Eva, however, felt a thrill that mirrored Elara's centuries ago – the unknown beckoned, promising discoveries that would reshape the understanding of the universe, even if the price was facing cosmic storms and the lonely vastness of interstellar space.
