
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in taverns and sung of in ballads – a city said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each rocky outcrop, each whispering shadow, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack, yet the unwavering hope for her brother fuelled her onward, a flickering torch against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a rare crystalline compound from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly, unknown fauna.  The journey across the galaxy, though technologically advanced, still held its perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the promise of scientific breakthrough and the thrill of charting the unknown propelled the crew further into the cosmic expanse.
