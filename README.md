The King's writ, a crumpled parchment clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches and glory in the far-off lands of Cathay.  But the path was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the whispers of plague stalked the weary travelers. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble with fate played out against the vast, untamed landscape.  He pressed on, driven by ambition and a desperate need to escape the poverty of his homeland.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter,' a sleek starship slicing through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate, Eva relied on her wits and advanced technology to overcome the challenges of interstellar exploration. The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of danger; the loneliness and the ever-present risk of system failure were a constant threat. Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled her forward, a descendant of those medieval adventurers, driven by the same thirst for discovery.
