
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests the next hill, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the Holy Land is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and disease stalks the crowded roads.  Yet, the whispered promise of Jerusalem's holy relics, and the yearning for adventure beyond her village, propel her onward, each creaking wagon wheel a step closer to the unknown.  The call of the road is a siren song, dangerous but intoxicating.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the dangers are no less real.  Pirate attacks are a constant threat, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes demands constant vigilance.  Each jump to a new system brings the possibility of discovery – new worlds teeming with life, ancient ruins whispering forgotten secrets, or the chilling emptiness of a dead planet.  The cosmos is a boundless frontier, and Eva, with her seasoned crew, dares to explore its every corner.
