
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria’s healing magic, and the desperate hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a relentless test of endurance and courage against the unforgiving landscape and the creeping shadow of death itself.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the hostile K'tharr raiders, Elara’s crew faced perils as vast as the cosmos itself.  The weight of responsibility for hundreds of lives, coupled with the chilling uncertainty of the unknown, made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, a breathtaking dance between survival and oblivion in the boundless expanse of the galaxy.
