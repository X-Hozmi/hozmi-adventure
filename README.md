
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate moors, a stark contrast to the tales of bustling cities and legendary treasures whispered in taverns back in York.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding a relic of immense power, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where outlaws lurked.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease, yet the lure of the unknown propelled him forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  The vastness of space held its own perils: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life. But the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos fuelled her unwavering determination, making each jump through hyperspace a thrilling leap into the uncharted territories of the future.
