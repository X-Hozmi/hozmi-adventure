
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown brush, sent a shiver down her spine.  She carried a worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a course to a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her pilgrimage, but the allure of the unknown, the whisper of legend, spurred her onward. The journey was harsh, but the thrill of adventure, the potential for discovery, made every hardship worthwhile.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; a single malfunction could mean the end.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was commonplace.  The thrill wasn't just about reaching the destination; it was the constant challenge, the camaraderie amongst the crew, and the sheer breathtaking beauty of the cosmos that fueled their relentless pursuit of the unknown frontiers of space.
