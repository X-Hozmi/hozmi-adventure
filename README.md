
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him after weeks on the road, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the breadth of France, fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of dysentery, was nearing its end.  The promised reward – a rare manuscript detailing lost alchemical secrets – fueled his weary steps, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and thrilling discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Xylos Prime.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was routine, but the unknown flora and fauna of Xylos Prime promised a challenge unlike any she'd faced.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the same allure of discovery and danger that had driven adventurers for millennia, just on a scale exponentially larger.
