
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the rugged, bandit-ridden plains of Aquitaine was perilous, each bend in the road holding the potential for ambush or worse.  She carried a secret map, whispered promises of untold riches in a forgotten monastery, and the gnawing fear of failure.  The creak of leather, the rhythmic beat of hooves, and the ever-present tension were the soundtrack to her desperate quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling the ever-present threat of subspace anomalies, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's experimental warp drive.  The vast, inky blackness of space held both wonder and unimaginable danger, a constant reminder of the fragile balance between exploration and oblivion.
