
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the disease itself.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking display of cosmic color.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a key technology capable of saving her dying world.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer.  But the allure of discovery, and the potential to rewrite the future, fueled her unwavering determination.
