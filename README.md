
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her trusty mare across the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth fills her nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales of exotic spices and shimmering silks whispered in taverns back in her village.  This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise painting the sky in fiery hues, Elara's resolve strengthens, fueled by a thirst for the unknown and a hope for spiritual cleansing.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and charting unmapped nebulae is a daily routine, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from countless worlds, share a common dream: to uncover the secrets of the universe.  The breathtaking beauty of alien planets, each a kaleidoscope of vibrant landscapes and bizarre life forms, fuels their unwavering spirit of discovery, despite the constant threat of cosmic anomalies and the chilling emptiness of the void.
