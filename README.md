
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious map, promising the legendary lost city of Ys.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the plague stalked her every step.  Yet, the allure of Ys, a city swallowed by the sea centuries ago, propelled her onward, a flickering ember of hope in a world cloaked in shadow and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable power rumored to exist on a planet orbiting a black hole.  Navigation charts were unreliable, wormhole jumps unpredictable, and pirate factions patrolled the galactic fringes.  But the promise of galactic domination, or at least a hefty payday, was enough to keep Razor and his motley crew pushing through the cosmic void, each jump a gamble against the crushing weight of the universe.
