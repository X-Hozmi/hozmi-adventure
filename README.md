Rumors of a lost city, said to be filled with treasures and ancient magic, had lured him from his castle. The journey was arduous, filled with bandits, treacherous passes, and the constant threat of wild beasts. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of glory and adventure, pushed him forward.

Their destination: the Kepler-186f system, rumored to harbor an advanced alien civilization.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with dangers - rogue black holes, hostile pirate factions, and the ever-present threat of the unknown. But Zara and her crew, seasoned explorers, were ready for anything. The cosmos beckoned, and their thirst for knowledge and discovery was insatiable.
