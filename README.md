
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered on the road to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy. Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the journey was no less perilous.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip apart her vessel, hostile alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the sheer vastness of the cosmos instilled a profound sense of isolation.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each new star system a potential graveyard for dreams – and perhaps, for her crew.
