
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-shifting hospitality of unfamiliar villages. Yet, the allure of the holy city, the whispered tales of miracles, and the shared camaraderie of the road spurred them onwards, their battered packhorses their only constant companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors.  Navigation through asteroid fields demanded laser-sharp precision, while the unpredictable nature of wormholes presented a constant threat of spatial distortion.  The loneliness of the cosmos was a heavy burden, but the hope of finding the colonists, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, fuelled her relentless journey.
