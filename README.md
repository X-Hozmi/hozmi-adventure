
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation dogged his steps, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, spurred him on, each hardship only strengthening his resolve.  He carried with him not only a map, but a heart filled with a daring hope that defied even the bleakest reality.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a signal their only guide through the vast emptiness between stars.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, navigation treacherous, and the potential for encountering hostile alien lifeforms a constant pressure.  But Elara, hardened by years spent charting the uncharted, held firm. The allure of discovery, the chance to unravel the mystery of the lost colony,  fuelled her every action, propelling her deeper into the galactic unknown.
