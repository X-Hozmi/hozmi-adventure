
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mount onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant rain hung in the air, a stark contrast to the dust coating her throat and chapped lips.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or the unknown terrors of the vast, uncharted wilderness.  Survival, let alone success, was a daily gamble played against the harsh beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The viewport displayed a breathtaking vista: the swirling nebula of Xylos, a cosmic kaleidoscope of incandescent gas and dust.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable solar flares was merely a Tuesday for Eva, but the loneliness of interstellar travel, the vast emptiness between star systems, was a constant companion, a weight heavier than any cargo.
