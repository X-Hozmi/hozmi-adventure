
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel containing only a few meager possessions and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Each day was a gamble: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled unpredictably, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow.  Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, with its tales of untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward, each hardship a small price to pay for the chance to uncover its secrets.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kerrigan steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of incandescent gas. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Ryla relied on her instincts and cutting-edge technology to reach her goal.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, yet the promise of discovery, of charting new frontiers for humanity, fueled her unwavering spirit.
