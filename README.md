
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life in the fabled city of Aethelred, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for survival, for a destiny yet unwritten.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in the starship *Stardust*.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors and retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks but in light-years, each jump across hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.  While the dangers were less immediate than Elara's, the sheer scale of the universe, the potential for encountering unknown alien species, and the weight of galactic exploration pressed upon them with equal, if different, intensity.
