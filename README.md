
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest – to deliver the sacred relic to the Abbot of St. Jude – was proving more arduous than any tale told in the taverns.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush, and the ever-present fear of bandits and wild beasts gnawed at his resolve.  But the promise of glory, and perhaps even a king's reward, spurred him forward into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was routine for Eva, but the sheer vastness of the cosmos always instilled a sense of profound wonder and humbling insignificance.  The weight of her mission, the fate of humanity potentially resting on her shoulders, paled in comparison to the breathtaking beauty of the universe unfolding before her.
