Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land. The journey was a tapestry woven with peril and breathtaking beauty, a gamble against fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming algae to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and maintaining the delicate balance of life support systems was a daily struggle.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy stretched before them, a canvas painted with the vibrant hues of dying stars and the ethereal glow of distant planets, a constant reminder of the immense scale of both the adventure and the responsibility she carried.
