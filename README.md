
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-scorched plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of his imagination, fuelled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy, rumored to hold a cure for the devastating Xylan blight sweeping across the Terran colonies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded unwavering focus and nerves of steel.  The vast, inky expanse of space, dotted with the glittering pinpricks of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying – a testament to the boundless possibilities, and the equally boundless dangers, of interstellar travel.
