
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming faintly under the overcast sky, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest, to recover the stolen Orb of Aethelred, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy dens of brigands. Each day brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, hostile terrain, and the ever-present threat of ambush. Yet, the allure of adventure, the promise of glory and the hope of restoring peace to his kingdom, spurred him onward, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the vibrant hues of alien landscapes, the silent majesty of black holes, and the ever-present hum of the starship’s engines. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards, and the mystery beckoning from the far reaches of the galaxy, made the risks worthwhile.
