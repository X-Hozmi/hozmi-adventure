
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow clinging to the biting wind. Her worn leather map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each creaking step brought her closer to the unknown, the thrill of discovery battling the ever-present fear of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements.  The journey was arduous, testing her resilience and spirit with every sun-drenched day and starlit night.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cut a silent path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists and astro-navigators, charted a course towards the Kepler-186f system, a rumoured haven for advanced civilizations.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant nebulae, held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Faster-than-light travel held its own perils, from spatial anomalies to pirate attacks, but the promise of first contact and groundbreaking discoveries fueled their courage.
