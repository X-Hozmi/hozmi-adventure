
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's ransom, a chest bound in iron, bounced precariously in the saddlebags behind him.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, and the treacherous mountain passes ahead promised even greater peril.  Yet, the thrill of the journey, the promise of riches and glory, fueled his relentless pursuit across the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe, each sunrise bringing a new challenge and a fresh taste of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate raids were commonplace hazards on this interstellar voyage.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, held a different kind of peril and excitement than Reginald's medieval quest, but the spirit of adventure, the yearning for discovery, burned just as fiercely within her.
