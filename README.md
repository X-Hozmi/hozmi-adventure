
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and guarded by djinn and monstrous beasts.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown spurred them onward, a shared thirst for adventure echoing the clash of their swords against the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and locate habitable planets for colonization.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained; unpredictable gravitational anomalies, pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena.  But Eva, like Sir Reginald before her, embraced the challenge, her heart pounding with the thrill of exploration, her eyes fixed on the distant, uncharted stars.
