
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and impending rain clinging to the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of tears and annotations, guided her across treacherous mountain passes and through whispering forests, each day a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature. The promised riches of the East, whispered legends of a mythical city, fueled her onward despite the constant threat of peril.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Each jump between star systems was a calculated risk, a dance with warp speeds and unpredictable gravitational currents.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic event decades prior.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold brilliance of distant suns, was both breathtaking and terrifying, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile foothold amongst the stars.
