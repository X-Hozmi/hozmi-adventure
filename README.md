
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the chill wind whipping at her cloak.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the fabled city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and whispers of mythical beasts kept her hand perpetually near the worn leather hilt of her dagger.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a desperate hope for survival as she pressed onward, driven by a desperate need to find a cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable gravitational shifts within the nebula itself.  Each jump through hyperspace risked a catastrophic malfunction, each survey of the star charts a gamble against the vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos.  Yet, driven by a profound sense of duty, Eva pressed on, her gaze fixed on the distant glimmer of hope on the horizon.
