
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped waterskin, a few dried figs, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or worse, the whispers of the plague that stalked the land. Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city of shimmering spires and untold riches, fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast emptiness.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The dangers weren't bandits or disease, but rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – a challenge far greater than any medieval adventurer could ever imagine.  Yet, the possibility of discovery, of expanding human reach, propelled her forward, a beacon of hope in the inky black.
