
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of ending the devastating plague sweeping across Europe.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them onward, their resolve tested by the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, *Stardust*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances between star systems, the constant threat of space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole jumps presented challenges far removed from Reginald's, yet just as perilous.  The journey tested the limits of human endurance and technology, but the promise of unlocking interstellar travel fueled Eva's relentless pursuit.
