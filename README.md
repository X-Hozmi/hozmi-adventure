
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpened her senses, honed by years spent traversing the unpredictable roads of a fractured kingdom.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her journey, a beacon against the bleak reality of famine and war. Bandits and treacherous terrain were constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, outweighed every risk.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant lullaby, punctuated only by the crackle of comms and the occasional asteroid avoidance maneuver.  Unlike the medieval world's limited horizons, Eva's journey was one of boundless possibilities, exploring alien landscapes and forging alliances with civilizations unlike any she had ever imagined. The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of rogue K'tharr warships – but the spirit of adventure burned as fiercely as it had in Elara's time.
