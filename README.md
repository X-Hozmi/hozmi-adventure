
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid delivered to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, was a challenge, a reminder of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each arduous mile, her resolve hardened, fueled by the desperate need to reach her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers both biological and technological.  The vast emptiness of space, the potential for catastrophic system failures, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were mere inconveniences in the grand scheme of galactic exploration. The thrill of discovery, the promise of untold riches and knowledge, outweighed any fear.
