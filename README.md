
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, heightens the sense of adventure and danger.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery at the edge of the known world, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are just some of the obstacles standing between her and her goal, fueling the perilous journey with a thrilling uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' hurtling through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate a rumored source of  Xylanite, a precious energy source crucial to the survival of her people.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, teeming with uncharted planets, potentially hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the promise of unimaginable wealth, and the responsibility to her people propel her and her crew onward, into the unfathomable depths of the cosmos.
