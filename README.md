
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by the desperate pleas of his people, spurred him onward through the harsh and beautiful landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace a hundred years prior.  Navigating through asteroid fields and nebulae, dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets, tested her skills and the ship's resilience to the extreme.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held the key to Xylos’ fate, and the silent hum of the hyperdrive was the only companion to her solitude as she plunged into the unknown, carrying the hopes of a generation on her shoulders.
