
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the midday heat shimmering off her chainmail.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept her ever vigilant.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious villagers, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, a city said to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting his cockpit in an alien glow.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the bone-jarring turbulence of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for Razor and his crew. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of terror than any medieval wilderness – the sheer isolation and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
