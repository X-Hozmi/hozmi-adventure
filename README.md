
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their weary mounts trudged through the mud, the stench of rotting vegetation heavy in the air. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and grappling with the unpredictable nature of wormholes, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond anything a medieval knight could imagine.  The vast expanse of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, offered breathtaking vistas and the constant, exhilarating gamble of survival amongst the stars.
