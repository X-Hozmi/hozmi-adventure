
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and damp earth, guided his destrier through the relentless mud.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath of his horse, marked another mile on their perilous journey to the Holy Land.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory and redemption, spurred them onward, a tiny band against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperdrive failures, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena were just some of the hazards she navigated, her courage fueled by the dream of a new beginning for humanity amongst the stars.
