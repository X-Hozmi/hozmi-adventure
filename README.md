
Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the whispering barley fields, offered little comfort against the relentless jostle.  Ahead lay the rumored Dragon's Tooth mountains, a perilous shortcut to the Sultan's court, filled with brigands, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort of his weary steed, marked the passage of another mile towards the unknown, a tapestry woven with both terror and thrilling anticipation.

The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been turbulent, pushing the Althea's engines to their limits, but the promise of the rumored Xylossian artifacts, lost for millennia, fueled her crew's weary determination.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, punctuated by the hum of the Althea's engines and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and hostile space pirates.
