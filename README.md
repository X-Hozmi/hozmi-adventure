
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, has tested him beyond measure. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation have chipped away at his resolve, yet the whisper of Zerzura's magic persists, a siren song urging him onward through the unforgiving landscape of the medieval world.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling Galactic Federation, hidden on a remote planet within a newly discovered galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers lurking in the shadows of hyperspace, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted planets requires courage, skill, and an unwavering belief in the greater good. The vastness of space holds both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable peril, pushing Captain Rostova and her crew to their limits in a relentless pursuit of their vital objective.
