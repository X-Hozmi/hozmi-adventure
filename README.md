
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather jerkin bears testament to countless skirmishes with brigands and the relentless elements.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for danger – a band of mercenaries, a rogue wolf pack, or simply the slow, agonizing death of dehydration.  Yet, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, fuels her onward.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown is a powerful siren’s call.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic tapestry.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the dangers are no less real.  Uncharted wormholes threaten to tear her ship apart, and pirate factions roam the interstellar lanes, preying on unsuspecting traders.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but Ryla, like Elara before her, is driven by an insatiable curiosity and the thrilling promise of discovery that lies beyond the known edges of the universe.
