
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the next windswept hill, the distant spires of Camelot a mere shimmer on the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll –  mud-caked boots, aching muscles, and the ever-present gnawing hunger a constant companion.  But the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, fuelled his determination.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new encounters, dangerous passes, and the chance to discover secrets older than the kingdom itself.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been smooth, but the upcoming survey of the planet's potential for terraforming held its own brand of peril.  Alien flora, unknown atmospheric conditions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every mission a gamble.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of uncharted worlds, and the possibility of discovering new life spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the galactic map.
