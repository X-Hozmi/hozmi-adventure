The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous – towering castles perched precariously on cliff faces, dense forests whispering with unseen dangers, and rivers swollen with spring melt demanding careful fording.  Each day brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.

The vastness of space offered both incredible beauty and terrifying isolation, but Eva and her crew, hardened by countless voyages, were ready to face whatever the cosmos threw their way.
