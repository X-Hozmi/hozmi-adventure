
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold forgotten magic and untold riches.  Bandit patrols, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the fire of his adventure, a journey far removed from the familiar comfort of his village.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, the potential for encountering alien lifeforms, both thrilling and terrifying, were constant companions on this interstellar voyage.  The hum of the engines, the faint crackle of the comms, were the sounds of her adventure, a quest for new worlds and the expansion of humanity's reach across the cosmos.
