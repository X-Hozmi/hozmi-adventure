
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's writ, a sealed parchment promising riches and land to whomever delivered it to the distant Duke of Aquitaine.  His journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present specter of disease stalked the land. Yet, with each league covered, the thrill of the unknown propelled him forward, the promise of adventure a powerful counterpoint to the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The cosmos glittered with a million suns, each potentially harbouring new worlds, new civilizations.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and seek out habitable planets for humanity's expansion.  The journey was perilous; asteroid fields threatened to shred her ship, unknown alien lifeforms could lurk in the shadows, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her crew. Yet, the boundless frontier beckoned, the chance to discover something extraordinary far outweighing the dangers.
