
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura, a city of shimmering spires and untold riches, fueled his weary spirit, pushing him onward despite the perils.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos cluster, a region said to contain planets capable of sustaining human life.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily routine.  The loneliness of interstellar travel weighed heavily, yet the hope of finding a new home for a dying Earth, a new cradle of civilization among the stars, kept her engine humming and her spirit soaring across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
