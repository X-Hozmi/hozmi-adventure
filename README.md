
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send them plummeting to their deaths, and the constant threat of disease and starvation shadowed every step. Yet, with each sunrise, her resolve hardened, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination and finding the healing she desperately sought.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a colony struggling on the fringes of explored space.  The journey wasn't just about distance; it was about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes, and the ever-present danger of pirates preying on vulnerable transports.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the knowledge that her cargo held the key to survival fueled her courage in the face of unimaginable odds.
