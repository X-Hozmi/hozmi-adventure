
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He shared meager rations with his loyal hound, their bond strengthened by the shared hardship of the journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe, their hope fueled by whispers of Eldoria's magic.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanite to the distant Kepler-186f colony, a planet teeming with life but desperately short on resources.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable hyperspace currents and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. The vast expanse of the galaxy, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, stretched before her, a testament to humanity's reach and the boundless opportunities – and perils – of interstellar travel.
