
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He was bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the travellers, and the endless expanse of steppe offered little respite from the elements.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of silks and spices, fuelled his weary steps, promising adventure beyond measure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation threatened the ship's integrity, asteroid fields presented constant navigation challenges, and the vast, uncharted reaches of space held mysteries both alluring and terrifying.  But Eva, a veteran explorer with a thirst for the undiscovered, pressed on, driven by the same relentless spirit of adventure that had propelled Thomas across the medieval world – the unwavering human desire to push the boundaries of the known.
