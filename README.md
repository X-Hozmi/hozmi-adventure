
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  The whispers of a mythical city of gold, shimmering on the edge of a forgotten desert, fueled her journey.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the relentless heat threatened to break her spirit, but the allure of the unknown, of pushing beyond the familiar confines of her village, propelled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the uncertainties of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched a hole through hyperspace.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of the cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant galaxies, both awed and humbled her.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of solar flares were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of discovering new worlds, of charting the unknown territories of the universe.  The quest for life beyond Earth, a beacon in the infinite darkness, was a journey far grander than any medieval pilgrimage.
