
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his mount onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered promise of salvation spurred him on, making even the most arduous journeys worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was a daily routine, but the vastness of space held a different kind of peril.  Uncharted anomalies, hostile alien races, and the constant threat of ship malfunction were challenges far removed from medieval hardship, but the allure of discovery – of finding a new home for humanity – fueled her courage, just as the hope of a cure had driven Sir Kaelan.
