
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan’s worn boots as he and his small band navigate the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Anatolia. Their quest: to recover a stolen relic, a sacred chalice rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst.  Their journey is a tapestry woven with peril and hardship, yet fueled by unwavering determination and a desperate hope for salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of space remains terrifyingly immense.  Her mission: to explore a newly discovered nebula, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading rogue space pirates, and facing the unknown wonders and dangers of unexplored systems, Elara's journey is one of scientific discovery and breathtaking risk, pushing the boundaries of human exploration beyond the confines of their solar system.
