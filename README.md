
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward.  Their destination: the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the grueling rhythm of travel – the creak of their pack animals, the crackling of campfires under vast, star-studded skies, and the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself.  Each sunrise brought the hope of discovery, balanced against the constant fear of the unknown.


Centuries later, the starship *Stardust Wanderer* pierced the void.  Captain Eva Rostova guided her crew across the Andromeda Galaxy, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space-time.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The journey was fraught with peril: rogue asteroid fields, pirate attacks, and the chilling vastness of space itself. Yet, the promise of a unified galaxy propelled them forward, a beacon against the infinite darkness.
