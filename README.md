
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean still clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way across the sun-baked plains of Provence, then into the treacherous, bandit-ridden foothills of the Alps.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, hostile lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, the allure of the exotic spices and silks of the East pushed us onward, each day a gamble against the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our guide.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hums beneath me as I navigate the nebula of Cygnus X-1, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, is measured not in days or weeks, but in years, each one a lifetime of research, repairs, and the quiet contemplation of the vast, uncaring universe.  The risks are different now – radiation storms, asteroid fields, and the chilling loneliness of interstellar space – but the thirst for discovery, for pushing the boundaries of the known, remains the same relentless force that propelled our medieval forebears.
