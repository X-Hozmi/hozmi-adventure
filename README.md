
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the secrets of a lost alchemist, a map promising untold riches, and a gnawing fear of brigands and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a reminder of the perilous journey ahead and the relentless, unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Survival depended on wit, courage, and a healthy dose of luck.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the allure of interstellar exploration, the potential for discovery, outweighed the risks.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant galaxies, was both breathtaking and terrifying, a testament to the boundless, yet unforgiving, nature of future travel.
