
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing daughter.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, fueled by the love for his child, spurred him across kingdoms and rivers, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of medieval adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula shimmering with impossible colours. Her mission: to establish first contact with the Xylos civilization on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, was a test of both technology and human resilience.  But the vastness of space, filled with untold wonders and mysteries, held a far greater allure than any terrestrial challenge, a siren song that called to explorers across the cosmic ocean.
