
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear that his sister's life would slip away before he could reach his destination. The weight of his hope, and the peril of his journey, spurred him relentlessly towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Warp jumps flung her across unimaginable distances, each one a gamble against unpredictable gravitational fields and pirate attacks. The vast, empty expanse of space, beautiful yet terrifying, offered no respite. Elara’s courage and skill were tested not only by the dangers of interstellar travel but also by the dwindling hope that her people might survive.  The fate of a planet rested on her shoulders and the trajectory of her ship.
