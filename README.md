
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine – not from the chill autumn air, but the whispered tales of brigands and wild beasts that haunted these woods. His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fuelled by faith and the desperate hope of finding a cure for his ailing sister.  The journey was fraught with peril – treacherous terrain, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the allure of the unknown, the chance to prove his mettle, drove him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy bursts, and repairing critical systems during hyperspace jumps were just a few of the hazards she faced. Unlike Reginald's quest, hers was not driven by faith, but by the insatiable human desire for discovery, the relentless pursuit of new worlds and the potential to uncover life beyond Earth.
