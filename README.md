
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory in his perilous journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a testament to human endurance and the enduring allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of space itself.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raids, and battling the unforgiving vacuum of space were just a few of the hurdles she faced.  The vastness of the cosmos, however, was matched only by the insatiable human spirit of exploration, driving Eva and her crew ever further into the infinite darkness towards a future brimming with untold possibilities.
