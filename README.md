
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The muddy track snaked through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and impending rain.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both his fear and his determination. Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship *Hope*, lost in the swirling chaos of the nebula decades ago.  The alien flora and fauna of Xylos, the treacherous gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks presented challenges far removed from Reginald’s, but the same unwavering spirit of adventure, the same burning desire to reach a distant goal, fueled her voyage across the galactic frontier.
