
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a thrill of both fear and excitement through her.  This journey, fraught with peril from bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable terrain itself, was a gamble – a desperate chase for a mythical cure for her ailing brother.  Success meant life; failure, oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a breathtaking backdrop to the vast, inky blackness of space.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers both biological and environmental.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, and communication with their home base was unreliable, leaving them isolated and reliant on their skills and courage.  The riches of Kepler-186f were tempting, but the journey to reach them – a perilous odyssey through uncharted star systems – was far more daunting.
