
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight.  Rumors of a lost monastery, said to hold secrets older than the kingdom itself, spurred her onward.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were small prices to pay for the chance to unravel the monastery's mysteries. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant companion on her arduous journey across the medieval landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable alien lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained: asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the galaxy was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly vast, the ultimate testing ground for a spacefarer's courage and skill.
