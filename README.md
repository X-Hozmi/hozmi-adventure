
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a perilous cargo that had already seen her evade brigands and navigate treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a ford to cross, a hostile village to appease, a shadow lurking in the whispering wheat fields.  Her destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, seemed as distant as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula, its iridescent colours painting the bridge in shifting hues.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby amidst the vast, inky black.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with life, but struggling against a devastating blight.  The galactic expanse held its own perils – unpredictable solar flares, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of encountering the unknown.  But Eva, like Elara before her, was driven by a purpose that transcended the dangers of her journey.
