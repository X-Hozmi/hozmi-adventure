
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his chainmail gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of glory, spurred him onwards through the heart of a vast and unforgiving land.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional means.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, navigating treacherous wormholes and evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets. But the potential discovery of a new energy source, one that could change the fate of humanity, fueled her unwavering resolve across the cosmic expanse.
