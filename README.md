He clutched the worn map, its faded ink hinting at the riches and dangers awaiting him in the distant city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandit attack, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of silks, spices, and untold tales, spurred him on across the unforgiving landscape, a lone adventurer against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos unfolding outside her viewport.  This wasn't a journey of bandits and bad weather;  the dangers were cosmic – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life. But the lure of discovery, the chance to chart new frontiers for humanity, fueled her determination to navigate the perilous expanse of interstellar space.
