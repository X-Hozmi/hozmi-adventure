
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping at my cloak as I guide my weary horse across the unforgiving expanse of the Carpathian Mountains.  Ahead lies the rumored city of K'tharr, said to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, but the path is treacherous.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed valleys, and the very mountains themselves seem to conspire against our passage, their jagged peaks clawing at the sky like the teeth of some slumbering beast.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the snow, sends a fresh wave of apprehension through me, fueling the desperate hope that guides my journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant, comforting drone against the black void.  We're charting a course through the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or months, but in generations.  My great-great-grandparents embarked on this mission to find a habitable world for humanity's future, a seed among the stars.  The stellar nurseries blaze outside our viewport, a breathtaking reminder of the enormity of space and the fragile hope we carry within the cold, metallic shell of our ship.  The challenges are not bandits or mountains, but cosmic radiation, equipment failures, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the promise of a new dawn, a new home, propels us onward.
