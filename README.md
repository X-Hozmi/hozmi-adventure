
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Sunstone Monastery, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested her endurance, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  But the whispers of the Sunstone's healing power, and the unwavering spirit of her traveling companion, a grizzled veteran named Gareth, kept her pushing forward, one aching step at a time.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  Instead of bandits, she faced the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held secrets both wondrous and deadly.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and bring back crucial data.  The journey was a gamble, a leap of faith across the unimaginable distances between stars, propelled by hope and the unwavering belief in humanity's boundless capacity for exploration.
