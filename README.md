
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope as he pressed further into the unknown, his loyal squire at his side, their resolve tested by both nature and man.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the existential dread of deep space.  The vast emptiness pressed in, a stark contrast to the vibrant alien landscapes that occasionally graced their sensors, each a potential hazard or a clue to the colony's fate.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was almost as formidable as the unknown dangers themselves.
