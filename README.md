
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guided her towards the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or the sting of desert scorpion, a constant reminder of the perilous nature of her journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a heady mix of fear and exhilaration.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, the wormhole unstable, but the promise of a new world, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was too tempting to resist.  Her crew, a motley collection of seasoned explorers and ambitious scientists, monitored the ship's systems as they hurtled through the cosmos, the vast expanse of space a breathtaking but potentially deadly backdrop to their audacious mission.  The unknown, once again, held both terrifying and exhilarating possibilities.
