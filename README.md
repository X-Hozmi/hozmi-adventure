
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a shimmering serpent of pack animals and weary travellers, wound its way through the sun-baked foothills of the Pyrenees.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista – sprawling vineyards giving way to rugged, untamed mountains, the air thick with the scent of pine and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, whether a chance encounter with a wandering minstrel or a desperate flight from a sudden storm.  Our goal, the fabled city of Damascus, felt both impossibly distant and tantalizingly close, a promise whispered on the wind.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship forged from starlight and ambition, hummed with the energy of a thousand suns as it traversed the void between galaxies.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a chance encounter with cosmic anomalies or uncharted nebulae.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced challenges far beyond those of any medieval journey – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering alien languages, and confronting the existential dread of the infinite cosmos.  Our destination, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel, beckoned from the edge of the universe.
