
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Tuscan landscape in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with dried meats and a worn map, held the promise of adventure – a rumored lost city nestled deep within the Apennine Mountains, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were less alluring prospects, but the thrill of discovery far outweighed the dangers.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant wolf howl, fueled her relentless pursuit.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Razor, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown,  looked forward to charting new worlds, discovering new life, and adding another chapter to humanity's interstellar saga.
