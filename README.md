Their journey across the desolate plains had been long and arduous, but the promise of the ancient city of Aethel, rumored to hold unimaginable riches, spurred them onwards.

Though the journey was fraught with danger, the allure of the unknown, the chance to chart a new course in the vast cosmic ocean, was a thrilling and intoxicating prospect.
