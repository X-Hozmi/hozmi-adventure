
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  His meager caravan, a motley collection of pack animals and weary travelers, inched its way across the unforgiving landscape.  Rumours of a hidden monastery, a sanctuary holding ancient knowledge, spurred them onward, despite bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril and a desperate hope that the legends were true. The journey tested their courage and resilience, forging bonds stronger than any castle wall.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against the vastness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was a daily routine, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion against the echoing silence of the cosmos.  The journey promised not gold or glory, but the fragile hope of finding humanity's forgotten children, a testament to human resilience across the unfathomable distances of the universe.
