
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles in her determined pursuit of a miracle. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, fueled by a love stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate incursions, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, though beautiful, was a lonely and unpredictable mistress; yet, the hope of rediscovering humanity's future propelled her through the endless black.
