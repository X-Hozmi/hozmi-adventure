
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Each creak of the pack mule carrying my meager supplies sent a fresh shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient magic, fueled my quest, pushing me onward despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  The vast, unforgiving landscape was a challenge, but the promise of adventure spurred me on.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone as we leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace. The crew, a ragtag bunch from a dozen different worlds, were as diverse as the star systems we traversed.  The dangers weren't wild animals or bandits this time, but nebula storms and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, lurking in the shadows of hyperspace.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae painted across the void and the sheer scale of the journey made the risks worthwhile.  This was exploration on a cosmic scale.
