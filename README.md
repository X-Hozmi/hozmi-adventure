
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d left his village seeking fortune and escaping a forced marriage, his destination the fabled city of Alexandria, whispered to hold untold riches and a life beyond the drudgery of his birth.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of both adventure and peril – bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck amidst the cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with danger; treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids punctuated the vast, silent expanse of space.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to rewrite the history of interstellar exploration, fueled her relentless pursuit across the galaxies.
