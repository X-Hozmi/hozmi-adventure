
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a ragged tapestry of  ox-drawn carts and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in my own heart.  We’re bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of hope, a fragile flame against the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each sunset brings the chilling certainty that the legendary city might only exist in whispered tales.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, leaving behind the familiar nebulae of the Milky Way for the uncharted territories beyond.  The thrill of discovery burns bright against the backdrop of infinite darkness, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of otherworldly suns.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, promising breathtaking wonders or terrifying encounters with alien civilizations, both benevolent and malevolent, waiting amongst the cosmic dust.
