
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dust-choked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, each nightfall the gnawing fear of the unknown.  We barter for water in parched villages, navigate treacherous mountain passes under a sky ablaze with stars, and share meager rations, bound together by a shared thirst for adventure and the promise of distant markets brimming with silks and spices. The allure of the East, a land whispered about in hushed tones, fuels our arduous journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and the thrill of discovery.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, our generation ship, leaps across the void between galaxies, its engines a hum against the backdrop of cosmic silence.  We navigate nebulae of impossible colours and encounter alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable vastness of the cosmos.  The search for habitable planets, for new resources, for understanding itself, drives us forward, forever pushing the boundaries of human exploration and challenging our perception of what it means to be alive in the grand cosmic tapestry.
