
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping at my cloak as I navigated the treacherous Alpine pass.  Each step was a gamble against the elements and unseen dangers – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous crevasses hidden beneath the snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. My goal:  the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the secrets of a lost civilization.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery fueled my weary limbs and kept my hope flickering against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a comforting vibration against the vast, inky blackness of space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Though the dangers were different –  cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of alien environments – the thrill of exploration remained the same.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a testament to human ingenuity and our unyielding desire to push the boundaries of the known universe.
