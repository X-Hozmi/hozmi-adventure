
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset the grim satisfaction of having survived another day in this brutal, beautiful land, his resolve fueled by the tantalizing promise of the desert’s hidden heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormholes, the ship's AI a vital but sometimes frustrating guide.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held perils far beyond those faced by Thomas.  Asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life formed a tapestry of adventure as she journeyed toward the unknown.
