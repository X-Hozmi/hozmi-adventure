
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's caravan lumbered across the parched plains, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each stamp of a weary horse's hoof, marked another mile on their perilous journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with the dangers of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The whispered tales of unimaginable riches and ancient magic spurred them onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the caravan's guide.  Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky void, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a swirling nebula.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a quest for habitable planets amidst a tapestry of celestial wonders and unforeseen cosmic anomalies.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, held both the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of oblivion.
