
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's weary band crested the hill, the spires of Aloria shimmering in the distance, a beacon after weeks traversing the unforgiving wilderness.  Their journey had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in Aloria, and the promise of the King's gold, spurred them onward, their battered armor a testament to the trials already overcome.  Each creak of saddle leather, each strained muscle, whispered tales of their arduous adventure.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a mesmerizing distraction from the looming threat of the Kryll invasion.  Her journey spanned light-years, traversing the vast emptiness between galaxies, each jump a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies and hostile alien patrols.  Advanced technology eased the physical hardships, but the emotional toll of isolation, the weight of command, and the constant tension of interstellar warfare were burdens no starship could shield her from.  The adventure was grand, breathtaking, but also lonely and perilous.
