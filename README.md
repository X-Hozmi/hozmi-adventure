
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest – to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister – felt less like a pilgrimage and more a desperate gamble against starvation and bandits. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential danger, a constant reminder of the unpredictable and perilous nature of medieval travel.  He pressed onward, fueled by hope and a dwindling supply of hardtack.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Nebula storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters tested the limits of both her ship and her crew's endurance.  The vastness of the galaxy, both breathtaking and terrifying, held the key to her mission's success, or its ultimate failure.
