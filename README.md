
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a chipped map, its parchment brittle with age, showing a rumored path to the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*. Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

But the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets fueled her unwavering determination.
