
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the challenges of treacherous terrain, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fuelled by hope and the whispered tales of forgotten glories. The journey tested their mettle, forging bonds of loyalty stronger than any steel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were their highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer', a sleek starship capable of jumping between galaxies. Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to contain a planet teeming with a life-sustaining mineral crucial to humanity’s survival. Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading pirate factions was a daily occurrence.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, instilled both awe and a profound sense of isolation.  Yet, the weight of their responsibility, and the hope they carried, kept them pressing onwards into the unknown.
