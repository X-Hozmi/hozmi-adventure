
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the creak of saddle leather a counterpoint to the rhythmic pounding of hooves.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble to reach the fabled planet of Aethel, said to possess a technology capable of saving her dying homeworld. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were mere inconveniences compared to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  But Eva, like Kaelan before her, pressed on, driven by a hope as bright and unwavering as the distant starlight.
