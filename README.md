
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a priceless illuminated manuscript, a secret entrusted to her by a dying scholar.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey to deliver the manuscript to the Abbey of Saint Gall.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear that she might not reach her destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of limitless energy said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Asteroids the size of moons whizzed past, while alien lifeforms, both beautiful and terrifying, lurked in the shadows of uncharted planets.  The galaxy held untold wonders and unimaginable dangers, but the lure of the crystal fueled Jaxx's relentless pursuit across the vast expanse of space.
