
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary beasts, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the sparse scrubland, holds the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the insidious whisper of disease.  Our meager supplies dwindle with each passing day, but the lure of Zerzura, with its rumored fountains of youth and unimaginable riches, fuels our onward push against the relentless march of the desert.

Centuries later, the Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The hum of the warp drive vibrates through our bones, a constant reminder of the immense distances we traverse.  The cosmos, a swirling tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, stretches before us, a breathtaking backdrop to our perilous journey.  But the unknown dangers of Xylos, and the possibility of encountering other sentient life, are far greater threats than any desert bandit or plague.
