
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the secrets of a forgotten alchemist, a scroll promising untold riches in the distant city of Constantinople.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the dangers lurking – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation system.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare element from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a resource crucial to the survival of her colony on Proxima Centauri b.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms were but minor inconveniences compared to the urgency of her task.  The adventure was not just about exploration; it was about survival itself.
