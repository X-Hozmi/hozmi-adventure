
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold miraculous healing powers, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of famine gnawed at their dwindling supplies. Yet, with each hardship overcome, a fierce sense of purpose propelled her forward, the promise of salvation a beacon in the encroaching night. The vastness of the medieval world, a tapestry of danger and beauty, unfolded before her with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of hope in the vast expanse of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, a swirling chaos of time and distance. Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential reward – the discovery of a new home for humanity – fueled her relentless pursuit. The cosmos, infinite and unforgiving, yet breathtakingly beautiful, held the promise of both unimaginable wonder and terrifying annihilation.
