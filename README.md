
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that prickled his skin.  He clutched the worn map, its creases mirroring the anxieties twisting in his gut.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to curing his plague-stricken village.  Each day was a battle against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing doubt that Ys was nothing more than a fanciful tale.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity's desperate expansion.  The journey, measured in light-years, was punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the silent, watchful gaze of the stars.  Risks were plentiful— rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic entities. Yet, Eva, fueled by the hope of a new beginning and the weight of humanity's future on her shoulders, steered her vessel towards the uncharted horizon, a solitary voyager on a galactic odyssey.
