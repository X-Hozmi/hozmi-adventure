
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had already tested their endurance.  Muddy tracks, treacherous mountain passes, and skirmishes with bandits were mere inconveniences compared to the gnawing hunger and relentless sun.  Each sunrise brought the promise of another day’s grueling trek, each sunset the uneasy certainty of another night spent under a vast, indifferent sky.  Their quest, fuelled by faith and a thirst for the unknown, pushed them relentlessly towards the horizon.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane connecting the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks; navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling unpredictable solar flares, and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the thrill of discovery spurred her onward, a modern-day adventurer traversing the cosmic sea in pursuit of knowledge and the expansion of humankind's reach.
