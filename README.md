
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been fraught with peril; bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous bogs swallowing whole wagons, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, its streets paved with gold and its temples shimmering with arcane power, spurred him on. Each creak of saddle leather, each labored breath of his horse, was a step closer to the untold riches and unimaginable dangers that awaited.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry of breathtaking cosmic vistas and terrifying near-misses with rogue asteroids.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling static of the comms system. Yet, the hope of discovering new life, of expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy, fueled her unwavering resolve.
