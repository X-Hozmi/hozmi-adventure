
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to be hidden beneath the waves, and recover the lost amulet of Aethelred.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of legend and the glint of potential glory spurred him onward, through sun-drenched fields and storm-lashed valleys.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the distant Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was a complex dance of astrogation and warp jumps, each a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the lurking dangers of uncharted space.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere orbiting a sun-like star, a relic of a long-vanished civilization said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a different kind of peril than Kaelan faced, a test of technology and courage against the indifference of the cosmos.
