
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden amidst the unforgiving sands of the Sahara.  Bandits, scorching sun, and dwindling supplies were constant threats, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets fueled his perilous journey across the vast and hostile landscape. Each creak of his saddle, each shifting dune, held the promise of both danger and discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel were all part of a day's work. But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of cosmic phenomena, and the knowledge that she was forging a path for humanity across the galaxy kept her spirit soaring amidst the dangers of interstellar exploration.
