
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow sharp in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide across the unforgiving terrain to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving elements and the unknown dangers that lurked around every bend.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of vibrant hues, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her navigation console. Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the Xylos system, a journey spanning lightyears across the vast expanse of the Milky Way.  While space pirates and unpredictable wormholes presented far different challenges than bandits and blizzards, the thrill of discovery and the unwavering pursuit of a distant goal burned as brightly as the stars that dotted the inky blackness of space.
