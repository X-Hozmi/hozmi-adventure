
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, trudge across the sun-baked plains.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation have tested their resolve. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising a different landscape and perhaps, a clue to their destination, keeps them moving forward, their hope fueled by whispered legends and the unwavering bond between a woman and her beast.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Serpent's Kiss*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey that will take him across the vast expanse of known galaxies.  The dangers are far removed from bandits and starvation – hostile alien lifeforms, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure are a constant presence. But the lure of scientific discovery, and the promise of a hefty payday, spurs Rexx onward, his trusty AI co-pilot, HAL-E, his only companion in the cold, indifferent vastness of space.
