
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the creak of his saddle.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the promise of salvation, propelled him ever forward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal detected after decades of silence.  The vastness of space was a different kind of wilderness, filled with the silent threat of asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But the hope of finding survivors, of reconnecting a fractured human lineage, fueled her journey across the galactic expanse.
