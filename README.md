
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or simply the relentless sun.  Yet, with every step, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a stark contrast to the mundane routine of her village life.  The journey was perilous, but the promise of spiritual solace, and the adventure itself, made it worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's vibrant hues.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster rumored to hold planets teeming with life unlike anything humanity had encountered.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the ship's engines and the occasional flash of distant stars, held a different kind of danger – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the potential for hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to expand human knowledge, far outweighed the peril; each jump to a new planet was a thrilling leap into the unknown, a testament to human courage and insatiable curiosity.
