
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions and a map, its edges frayed from countless journeys.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones, promising untold riches and escape from the encroaching plague.  Each creaking step of her faithful mule brought her closer to the unknown, a symphony of danger and hope echoing in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' cut a swathe through the nebula, its engines humming a hypnotic tune.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, speckled with the glittering dust of a million dying stars, held both terrifying beauty and the promise of discovery. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
