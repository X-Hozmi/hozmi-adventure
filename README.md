
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promises a hidden monastery holding the cure for her ailing brother.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of traversing treacherous landscapes to reach her goal, fuels her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  cuts through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its engines humming a low, resonant song.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  While the risks are different – cosmic radiation, gravitational anomalies, and the potential for encountering unknown civilizations – the same adventurous spirit that drove Elara burns in Ryla’s heart, the boundless expanse of space replacing the medieval wilderness as her stage for exploration and discovery.
