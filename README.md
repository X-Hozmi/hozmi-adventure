
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering faith in her heart fueled her onward, her pack containing not just meager supplies, but the hope of a life renewed.  Each hardship forged her resolve, transforming her into a testament to human resilience in the face of unforgiving landscapes and uncertain times.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive sputtering to life.  Before him lay the swirling nebula of Xylos, a gateway to a thousand uncharted worlds.  His mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to power interstellar travel on a scale never before imagined.  The risks were astronomical – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of void storms. But the allure of discovery, the possibility of unlocking the universe's greatest secret, eclipsed all fear.  The vastness of space was a terrifying and beautiful challenge, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and ambition.
