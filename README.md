
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's small band picked their way across the parched landscape. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, fueled their weary legs and steeled their resolve.  They journeyed not for gold alone, but for glory, for legend, and for the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the cosmic dust cloud decades prior.  Faster-than-light travel was treacherous, a gamble against warped spacetime and rogue asteroids.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on them.  But Eva, a veteran explorer with a steely gaze and unwavering spirit, pressed on, guided by faint signals and the unwavering hope of finding survivors, of making contact with a piece of lost history among the stars.
