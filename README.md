
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, undulating plains of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost monastery of Saint Gildas, said to hold the secret to curing the Black Death that ravaged her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog, each fleeting glimpse of a distant castle or bustling town, represented a new challenge, a new risk in her perilous journey across a continent rife with war, banditry, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Survival, let alone success, felt like a distant dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of limitless energy coveted by empires across the galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, potentially leading to uncharted systems teeming with hostile alien life or treacherous gravitational anomalies.  While the dangers differed drastically from Elara's, the core remained the same: a relentless pursuit of a goal, fueled by hope and shadowed by the ever-present threat of failure, a thrilling and terrifying adventure in the vast expanse of space.
