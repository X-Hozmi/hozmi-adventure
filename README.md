
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried provisions; it contained the hope of finding her estranged brother, lost somewhere in the sprawling, bandit-ridden lands beyond.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with unfriendly villagers, and the ever-present threat of wild animals. Yet, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a potent elixir against fatigue and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable wormholes and the possibility of encountering unknown sentient life.  While technological marvels minimized the physical hardships, the mental strain was immense—the isolation, the pressure of exploration, the ever-present risk of encountering hostile forces.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, new possibilities, ignited a fire within her that burned brighter than any hyperdrive.
