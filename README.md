
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke and sweat. His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, led him through treacherous forests, across raging rivers, and over jagged mountain passes.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the rumored jewel spurred him on, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hyperspace travel.  The vastness of space held its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fractured civilization, propelled her forward, a shining star against the inky blackness of the cosmos.
