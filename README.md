
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a map – a faded testament to her quest to find the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Each creaking step of her weary beast was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements, but the lure of adventure, of uncovering untold history, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula known as the Serpent's Eye.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst swirling cosmic dust and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  While the risks were different – alien lifeforms, volatile celestial phenomena, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar space – the thrill of discovery burned just as fiercely in her heart as it had in Elara's, an echo of humanity's timeless yearning to explore the unknown.
