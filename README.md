
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's steed as he urged the weary animal onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him further into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the last vestiges of the ancient Proxima civilization.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle, yet the journey was far from easy.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and the vast emptiness between stars instilled a bone-deep loneliness.  But the lure of lost knowledge, and the possibility of uncovering secrets that could reshape the future, drove her onward, a lone explorer charting a course through the infinite expanse of space.
