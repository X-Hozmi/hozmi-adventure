
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a brown haze against the relentless sun.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland – was a perilous journey across kingdoms rife with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim reminder of the countless miles still stretching before him.  He pressed on, driven by hope and the weight of his people's lives.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of space – rogue asteroids, gravitational shears, and the ever-present threat of pirates – made every jump a gamble.  Elara, her face illuminated by the console's holographic displays, relied on her crew's expertise and her own unwavering determination to reach Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
