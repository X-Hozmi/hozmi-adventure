
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of a powerful artifact.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, vast, unforgiving deserts, and the constant threat of disease.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and camaraderie, punctuated by the thrill of discovery and the terror of the unknown. The very air crackled with anticipation, the promise of glory and untold riches a powerful lure against the harsh realities of their perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's navigation systems.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown lifeforms and perilous, unmapped terrain.  Unlike the medieval knights of old, Eva’s struggles were against the vast emptiness of space, the unpredictable behaviour of alien ecosystems, and the ever-present threat of mechanical failure light-years from any help.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to expand human understanding, propelled her forward,  making this interstellar voyage every bit as thrilling and dangerous as any medieval quest.
