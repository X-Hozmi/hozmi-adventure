
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, bound for the rumored City of Gold in the east.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty stomachs, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Yet, with every creak of the saddle and every distant mountain peak, a thrill coursed through her – the exhilaration of the unknown, the promise of riches and glory, outweighed the perils of a journey across a continent scarred by war and plague.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula's shimmering dust clouds aboard the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with its own dangers: rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the lure of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting unmapped territories teeming with alien life, propelled them forward, each warp jump a leap into the vast, breathtaking unknown.
