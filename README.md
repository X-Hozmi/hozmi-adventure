
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the dangers that lurked – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and recover the lost Orb of Aethelred, drove him onward, ignoring the gnawing hunger and the growing weariness in his bones.  He was a pilgrim on a sacred journey, fueled by hope and a desperate need for glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted cosmic currents.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of her mission – a search for habitable worlds for a dying humanity. The weight of her responsibility, the lives of her crew, and the future of her species, were heavy burdens carried across the unimaginable distances between the stars.
