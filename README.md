
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn leather boots pounded the cobblestones of a nameless village, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the chill wind.  His quest: to reach the fabled Sunstone monastery nestled high in the Dragon's Tooth mountains, rumored to hold the key to ending a plague sweeping the land.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies were mere inconveniences compared to the urgency in his heart.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim possibility of failure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light-years to the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos.  Her mission: to establish contact with a potentially sentient life form.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were hazards, yes, but the allure of discovering a new civilization and expanding humanity's reach eclipsed the risks a thousandfold.
