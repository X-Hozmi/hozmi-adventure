
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Gareth and his small company pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled their weary bodies and spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Eva and her crew faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Warp drives hummed, alien landscapes flashed by the viewport, and the vastness of space both terrified and enthralled them.  The ultimate goal, however, remained constant: the relentless pursuit of humanity's expansion across the cosmos.
