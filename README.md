
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Fiacre, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very landscape seemed to conspire against them, with raging rivers and treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered. Their only companions were the stars, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the unwavering faith that fueled their weary legs.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel.  The journey across the galaxy was a test of endurance, her crew battling malfunctioning systems, pirate raids, and the constant gnawing fear of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms in the uncharted regions of space.  Yet, the promise of discovery and the weight of responsibility propelled them forward, each hyperspace jump a leap of faith into the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
