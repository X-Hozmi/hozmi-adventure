
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the sprawling, unknown kingdom of Eldoria, rumored to hold both untold riches and treacherous beasts.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offered little comfort against the vastness of the journey.  Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow cast by the setting sun, held the promise – or the threat – of adventure.  She clutched the worn leather hilt of her father's dagger, a silent prayer for safe passage on her lips.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive engaged, a shimmering streak of light against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a legend passed down through generations of spacefarers.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling nebulae and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The potential for discovery, for contact with the unknown, burned bright within her, a counterpoint to the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.
