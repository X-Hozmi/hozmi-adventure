
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged English countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical Isle of Avalon, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each fleeting glimpse of a hooded figure on the horizon, fueled both his fear and his unwavering determination to reach his destination before it was too late.  The road was fraught with peril; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a marathon, not a sprint; months spent battling cosmic storms, repairing hull breaches caused by micrometeoroid impacts, and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  Her mission: to locate a legendary lost colony, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying world.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, each alien encounter a potential ally or devastating foe.  But the promise of salvation pushed Elara and her crew further, into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
