
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, fueled a mix of fear and fierce determination.  Robbers, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on her arduous journey across the kingdom, testing her resilience with every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from a remote mining colony on the planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of warp travel were all in a day's work for the seasoned captain.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held far more dangers than any medieval mountain pass, but the stakes, and the thrill of the journey, were just as high.
