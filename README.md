
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The rough track, barely a trail in places, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of apprehension through him – bandits, wild animals, the unknown itself lurked in the shadows.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland, a journey fraught with peril but one he was determined to complete.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony light-years from Earth.  The ship’s AI, HALIX, hummed with calculations, charting a course through asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational currents.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue planets, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration, the boundless expanse of the unknown, remained the same powerful draw, pushing Eva and her crew towards the vast, uncharted frontiers of the galaxy.
