
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier on his journey to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Rumors of untold riches and powerful magic fueled his quest, outweighing the ever-present dangers of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in his belly. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  Ahead, the swirling nebula of Xylos blazed, a breathtaking spectacle and a navigational hazard in equal measure. Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, pirate vessels, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies – but the allure of galactic exploration far outweighed the risk.  The cosmos beckoned.
