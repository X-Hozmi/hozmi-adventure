
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of impending danger.  She carried a king's ransom in her saddlebags, a desperate gamble to save her village from a crippling famine, her journey a relentless race against starvation and the lurking dangers of brigands and wild beasts.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  The cosmos stretched before him, an infinite tapestry of swirling colours and distant suns.  He charted a course through asteroid fields, dodging rogue space rocks with practiced ease, his comms crackling with warnings from his crew about approaching gravitational anomalies. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the edge of explored space, a journey fraught with peril from unknown alien species and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.
