
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a restless spirit.  Ahead lay the unknown – a rumored city of gold nestled deep within the whispering forests, a journey fraught with peril from bandit lords and treacherous terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, of triumph or devastating loss.  The journey was as much a test of her courage as it was a quest for fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Navigation systems flickered, depicting the chaotic nebula they were attempting to traverse.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets light-years apart, a daring expedition across galaxies teeming with uncharted dangers.  The whine of the hyperdrive was the soundtrack to their improbable quest, a race against time and the unforgiving vastness of space itself.
