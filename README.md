
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored hidden monastery of Saint Fiacre, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumor in a passing village, fueled her onward.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences compared to the desperate urgency in her heart.  This journey, fraught with peril, was her only chance.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson light painting the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter' in hues of alien beauty.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across the galaxy.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, the navigation through uncharted asteroid fields a deadly dance.  But Jax, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, relished the challenge.  For him, the vastness of space held not fear, but the promise of untold wonders, and the thrilling pursuit of the unknown.
