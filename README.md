
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim possibility of failure, yet the lure of Zerzura burned brighter than any hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to possess a technology capable of interstellar peace.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were daily obstacles in her galactic odyssey.  Each new star system offered both breathtaking wonder and terrifying unknown, but the hope of finding Kepler-186f and bringing peace to the galaxy fueled her courageous voyage across the cosmic ocean.
