
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing properties.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, Elara pressed on, fueled by the unwavering determination to reach her destination, a beacon of hope in a world steeped in hardship and uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking panoramas of celestial wonders, but also held dangers unseen – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  Equipped with cutting-edge technology and a crew of hardened explorers, Ava navigated the cosmic sea, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, each planet a potential clue in a desperate race against time.
