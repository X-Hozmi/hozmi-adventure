
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the biting wind whipping her cloak around her.  Below, a valley unfolds, a tapestry of emerald fields and dark forests – her path to the mythical Sunstone city.  Bandits lurk in the shadows, storms threaten the unforgiving mountain trails, and the whispers of ancient magic cling to the very air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resourcefulness as she navigates this perilous land, driven by a desperate hope and the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel allows her to traverse unimaginable distances, jumping between star systems, each a vibrant tapestry of alien worlds.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  But the vastness of space holds dangers as formidable as any medieval landscape; rogue asteroids, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure all test the crew's skills and the ship's resilience in this grand, interstellar odyssey.
