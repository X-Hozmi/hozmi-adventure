
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the late afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound its way through the dense Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the distant court of King Alfonso, bearing a vital message that could prevent a devastating war.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the tension as he navigated treacherous passes and evaded suspicious bands of mercenaries, his journey a constant test of courage and endurance against the unpredictable wilderness and its dangers.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal detected after decades of silence.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies was commonplace, but the true challenge lay in the vast, uncharted expanse of space itself.  Each jump through hyperspace, a gamble against the unknown, brought them closer to a destination that might hold the key to the colony's fate or, perhaps, a terrifying truth about the galaxy.
