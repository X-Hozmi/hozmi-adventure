
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Avignon a distant shimmer in the hazy heat.  Her journey from Prague has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar dialects to bartering for meager provisions in dusty villages. Yet, with every hardship overcome, her resolve strengthens, fueled by the whispered tales of the exotic lands that await, and the hope of finding the lost scroll her father entrusted to her.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel has shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers haven't vanished.  Space pirates lurk in the shadows between stars, and unpredictable gravitational anomalies threaten to crush his vessel.  His mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of Xylos crystals across three galaxies, a voyage measured not in days or weeks, but in subjective months, warped by the distortions of space and time. The vast emptiness is punctuated by the brief, breathtaking beauty of alien planets, each a tantalizing promise of adventure yet to come.
