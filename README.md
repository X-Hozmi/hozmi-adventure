
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the chill wind whipping my cloak around me as I rode towards the distant peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Rumours of a lost city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts, spurred my journey.  Each creak of my saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of anticipation and danger.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles I faced in my quest for glory and forgotten treasures.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  My destination: Xylos, a planet nestled within the Andromeda galaxy, promised untold scientific discoveries.  The journey, however, was a perilous one – navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of warp travel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, but the allure of the unknown, the potential for groundbreaking research, fuelled my determination to reach my destination.
