
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry; it was a grueling test of endurance, fraught with bandits, unpredictable weather, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, sent a shiver down her spine, but the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, kept her going.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but the thrill of exploration was tempered by the ever-present hum of the warp drive and the nagging concern about fuel reserves.  Ahead lay uncharted territory, promising untold riches and scientific discoveries, but also the very real threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of their mission and the immense risks they were undertaking.
