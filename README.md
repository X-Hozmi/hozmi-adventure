
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward. The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the ever-present stench of decay, a grim reminder of the plague that stalked the land. Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Whispering Mountains, said to hold the cure.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh surge of adrenaline through her, fueling her journey through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  Survival was a daily victory, a testament to her resilience and the unwavering hope burning within.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure centuries ago.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown; encountering rogue asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravity wells, and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer.  The vastness of space dwarfed even his ambition, but the faint signal from Xylos beckoned him onward, a siren song in the cosmic void.
