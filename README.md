
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Aquitaine in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous rivers snaked their way across the landscape, and the whispers of a vengeful sorcerer echoed in his ears.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival in this brutal, beautiful land.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by the interstellar void decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the psychic storms that threatened to shatter the ship's shields.  The vast, glittering expanse of space, a tapestry of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, held both the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of oblivion.
