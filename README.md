
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the hope of salvation fueled his journey, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been fraught with peril, the ship buffeted by unforeseen gravitational forces.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  The vastness of space held dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's fears – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure. Yet, the promise of a new beginning spurred her onward, a shining star in the cosmic void.
