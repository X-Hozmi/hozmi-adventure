
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sun, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his weary body and determined spirit, driving him further across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light years away across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-vigilant patrols of the Kryll Empire, Eva and her crew faced challenges far exceeding any medieval knight’s.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of warp travel, and the potential for catastrophic system failures presented constant peril, but the promise of a prosperous future for her people spurred them on, even as the vast, unknowable darkness pressed in around them.
