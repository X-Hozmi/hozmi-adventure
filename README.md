
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious seeds of a rumored drought-resistant grain, a desperate hope against the famine gripping her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat; bandits, disease, and the vast, unforgiving wilderness itself loomed larger than any dragon in a campfire tale.  This journey was a gamble, a desperate bid for survival, an adventure etched in fear and yearning.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but lightyears.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the terrifying immensity of space.  Alien encounters, navigational hazards, and the ever-present threat of pirates were daily realities, but the possibility of finding the missing colonists, of bringing hope to a forgotten people, fueled her courage against the cold, star-dusted void.
