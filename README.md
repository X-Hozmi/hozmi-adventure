
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel bumping against her thigh.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse grasses, held the promise of both peril and wonder.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown propelled her onward, fueled by a sister's unwavering devotion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the hypnotic dance of distant stars, held a different kind of danger than Elara's journey.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel were her concerns.  But the hope of discovering new life, of expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy, ignited a fire within her, a thirst for discovery as potent as Elara's love for her brother.
