
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in taverns and sung by bards, a place said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests teeming with brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose in this perilous journey across a land both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing vital systems under the relentless gaze of alien stars became the mundane realities of her intergalactic odyssey.  The vast expanse of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, but also the chilling possibility of oblivion.
