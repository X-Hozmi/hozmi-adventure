
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous, rocky path.  Her mule, burdened with meager supplies, struggled onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst the nomadic tribes.  Rumors of untold riches and powerful magic fuelled her journey, a perilous trek across unforgiving landscapes, dodging bandits and braving blizzards, all for the chance to find her fortune and perhaps, a new life.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the allure of the unknown propelled her forward.

Centuries later,  Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  The journey was a calculated risk, a gamble against warp-core malfunctions and unforeseen cosmic events.  He carried the hopes of humanity on his shoulders, a lone explorer charting a course towards a new beginning amidst the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.  The stars were his guide, and the thrill of discovery his constant companion.
