
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree – a desperate quest for a legendary herb rumored to cure the Black Death – propelled him across the treacherous landscape. Each day was a gamble: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled into raging torrents, and the gnawing hunger threatened as much as any sword.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him further into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, each jump through hyperspace a breathtaking gamble with the fabric of spacetime.  Alien anomalies, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every sector a perilous dance with fate.  But the promise of discovery, the lure of uncharted worlds, fueled her unwavering resolve.
