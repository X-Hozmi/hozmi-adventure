
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than the promise of the fabled Sunstone city, hidden somewhere beyond the Whispering Mountains. Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary sigh from her mule, was a step closer to a legend, a chance to rewrite her family's fortune and maybe, just maybe, escape the crippling poverty of her village. The journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of untold riches and a life beyond hardship fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense tapestry of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Lyra, scattered across multiple planets within the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids were commonplace hazards; the true challenge lay in deciphering ancient star charts and overcoming the loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the hope of reuniting with long-lost kin, and the promise of uncovering a forgotten civilization, kept her engine humming across the void.
