
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire as he and his small band pressed towards the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swollen, and the whispers of plague stalked them like a phantom. Yet, the lure of the Silk Road's riches, and the whispered promise of untold knowledge, fueled their arduous trek across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the shimmering tapestry of stars, held both wonder and danger.  Hyperdrive jumps were precarious, asteroid fields a constant threat, and the unknown lurked in every unexplored system. But the possibility of discovering new life, and charting new territories for humanity, made the unimaginable risks worth taking.
