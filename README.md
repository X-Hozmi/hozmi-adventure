
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained a stolen map, rumored to lead to a hidden monastery said to hold the lost Gospels of St. Jude.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel. The whispered promise of ancient knowledge spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a faster-than-light engine capable of traversing entire galaxies. Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work for Nova and her crew. The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both unimaginable wonders and deadly perils, but the lure of technological advancement, and the potential for a galactic leap forward, burned brighter than any nebula.
