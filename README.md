
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promises both peril and passage.  My small band of mercenaries, spurred on by the promise of gold and glory, pushes onward, braving treacherous passes, evading bandits, and bartering for meager sustenance in the scattered villages.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory in our arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive, a symphony of controlled chaos propelling us across the void.  The swirling nebula outside our viewport is breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of colours unimaginable on Earth.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, mapping potentially habitable planets and searching for signs of other intelligent life.  The risks are immense—uncharted asteroid fields, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena—but the potential rewards, the expansion of human knowledge and the discovery of new worlds, are a siren song too compelling to resist.
