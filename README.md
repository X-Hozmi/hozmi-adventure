
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom – or so it was rumored – tucked within a waterskin disguised as a common flask.  His journey, from the bustling port of Marseilles to the shadowy castle of Lord Elmsworth, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the dense forests, and rumors of a plague spreading faster than wildfire added a chilling urgency to his already dangerous mission.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh shiver down his spine.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Captain Eva Rostova's ears as she navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The mission, a desperate search for resources to sustain a dying humanity, was fraught with the same dangers as Thomas's, albeit on a cosmic scale.  Uncharted nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters kept her crew on high alert.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own brand of fearsome uncertainty.
