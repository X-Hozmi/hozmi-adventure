
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed on.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury to seek a cure for the squire's ailing mother, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the relentless rain threatened to turn the path into a quagmire.  Yet, each sunrise brought renewed determination, the promise of reaching their destination fueling their weary steps.  The rough beauty of the English countryside, punctuated by ancient castles and bustling market towns, served as a constant reminder of the rich tapestry of life that unfolded along their arduous path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, the vast emptiness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  Though years might pass on Earth, Eva’s journey was a race against time, a solitary voyage fueled by scientific curiosity and a stubborn refusal to let the unknown conquer her spirit.
