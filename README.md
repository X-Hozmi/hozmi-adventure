
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary in a distant monastery.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grasses, sent a shiver down her spine, a reminder of the bandits and harsh weather that lay between her and her destination.  The sun beat down relentlessly, mirroring the relentless pressure of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable colors and celestial wonders, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a struggling colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, hostile space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp-core failure. The weight of countless lives rested on her shoulders, a burden far heavier than any earthly pack mule.
