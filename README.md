
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the sun glinting off her worn leather armor.  Ahead lies the treacherous Black Mire, legendary for its quicksand and brigands, but beyond that lies the rumored Sunstone city, said to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Her meager supplies, a map scored with ancient runes, and her unwavering courage are all that stand between her and her desperate hope.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels the thrilling uncertainty of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula shimmering with cosmic dust, the vastness of the Andromeda galaxy stretching before her.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet Xylos, a world whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and deadly dangers.  With her loyal crew, she navigates asteroid fields and encounters alien life forms, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown. The thrill of exploration, the weight of responsibility, and the siren call of the cosmos propel them onward.
