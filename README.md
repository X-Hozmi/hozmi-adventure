
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map promising untold riches in the East, bounced against his back.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, sent shivers down his spine, not just from the cold, but from the unknown dangers lurking beyond the next hill.  Bandits, disease, and the endless, unforgiving landscape itself were all formidable foes on his pilgrimage.  He pressed on, driven by a thirst for adventure and a hope that outweighed his fear.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense power – and potential peril – of their journey.  Across the vast expanse of space, civilizations both friendly and hostile awaited, their intentions as unpredictable as the cosmic storms that threatened to tear her ship apart.  The galaxy was her playground, and the stakes, impossibly high.
