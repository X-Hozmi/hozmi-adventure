
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from over; rumors of a hidden monastery holding ancient knowledge spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the unforgiving terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath of her mount, was a testament to the risks she took in pursuit of her dream.

The mission – to locate a mythical energy source whispered about in ancient xeno-archaeological texts – was pushing the limits of both his ship and his crew.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the blinding brilliance of distant nebulae, held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger; the reward, however, promised to rewrite galactic history.
