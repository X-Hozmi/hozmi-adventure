
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of thyme and fear.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged Abbey of Saint Michael, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and past bandit-infested forests where shadows whispered of darker things. Each day brought new peril, new challenges, testing both his courage and his endurance in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her ship a tiny speck against the awe-inspiring backdrop of a nebula.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Hyperspace jumps brought sudden, dizzying shifts in perspective, while navigating asteroid fields required nerves of steel and pinpoint precision.  Alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, punctuated her journey, each one a thrilling and potentially fatal gamble in this vast, uncaring cosmos.
