
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's battered retinue crested the hill, the spires of Camelot a distant shimmer on the horizon.  Their journey across the ravaged English countryside had been brutal – bandits, storms, and dwindling supplies a constant threat.  Yet, the thrill of the quest, the whispered legends of the lost artifact hidden within the crumbling ruins of Tintagel, spurred them onward, each weary step a testament to their unwavering courage and the allure of the unknown.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to hold ancient, powerful technology.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional flicker of distant suns, was a thrilling, terrifying expanse, the risks as immense as the potential rewards of her intergalactic voyage.
