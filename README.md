Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each screech of hawk overhead, marked another step into the unknown, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where a single wrong turn could mean life or death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were just part of the routine – the true adventure lay in the promise of discovery, the hope of finding life beyond humanity's grasp, a thrilling gamble against the vast emptiness of space.
