
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the plague itself.  But the hope of Ys, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel, spurred her on through treacherous passes and across swollen rivers, a testament to the unwavering courage of those who dared to journey beyond the known.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever, the swirling nebulae outside her starship window a kaleidoscope of impossible colors.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling on the fringes of explored space, across a gulf of light years and through potentially hostile territories.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of void storms were all part of a day's work for a galactic freighter captain. The vast, unforgiving cosmos demanded skill, daring, and an unwavering spirit – the same spirit that drove medieval adventurers centuries before, only now fueled by faster-than-light drives and the promise of a galaxy far, far away.
