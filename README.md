
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a sacred relic, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – a ford to cross, a mountain pass to conquer, a village to barter with – a tapestry of adventure woven from hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the disparate planets of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage demanding meticulous calculations and daring leaps of faith.  Cosmic storms, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters were the hazards of her path. Each jump to hyperspace, each new system explored, brought the promise of unimaginable wealth and uncharted wonders.
