
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother – was a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel: unforgiving terrain, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of human malice.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faintest whisper of a long-lost signal.  The vast emptiness of interstellar space pressed in, punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the ship's engines and the distant, glittering tapestry of galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a missing research team, potentially stranded on a hostile planet light years away.  The dangers were different now – radiation storms, uncharted wormholes, and the unknown alien lifeforms that might lurk in the unexplored sectors – but the thrill of exploration, the relentless push into the unmapped, remained a timeless human drive.
