
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air. Her journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering hope of reaching her destination spurred her onward, fueled by faith and the unwavering spirit of a medieval traveler.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger resided in the unpredictable space storms and the potential hostility of unknown alien species.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown, pressed on, guided by the faint signal emanating from the lost colony, a beacon in the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
