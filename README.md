
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess a miraculous healing balm.  Each creaking step of the mule, each treacherous pass negotiated, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the elements themselves.  The adventure was not glamorous, but the stakes were high, the journey etched deep into her soul.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with cosmic dust.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Xylos system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with perilous encounters.  Unlike Elara's pilgrimage, Eva's voyage was technologically advanced, but the underlying thrill remained – the thrill of the unknown, the push against the boundaries of possibility, the weight of responsibility for the crew and the fate of countless others who depended on her success.
