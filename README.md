
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred him onwards, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that had vanished near the unexplored edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling silence between stars.  But the thrill of discovery, the chance to uncover the mystery of the lost colony, fueled her journey across the uncharted expanse, a lone explorer pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
