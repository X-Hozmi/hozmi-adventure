
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a vital message for a distant monastery, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, and the rumors of a plague sweeping across the land are chillingly real. Each sunrise brings a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager sustenance in hostile villages, and constantly looking over her shoulder, for safety is a luxury few travelers can afford.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The journey is less about bandits and more about navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, the risks amplified by the immense scale of space. While Elara faced human threats, Ryla confronts the silent dangers of the cosmos – failing engine systems, cosmic radiation, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms.
