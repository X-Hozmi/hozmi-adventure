
The year is 1347.  Dust coats my worn leather boots as I trudge across the sun-baked plains, the distant silhouette of the Pyrenees mountains a mocking reminder of the journey still ahead. My meager pack holds little more than dried meat, a waterskin nearly empty, and the worn map my father entrusted to me before his passing.  Each creak of the saddle beneath me, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the promise of both peril and adventure.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain itself are constant threats, but the lure of the legendary city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fuels my weary steps.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we leap across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside our viewport are breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of impossible colours and celestial wonders, but the mission is far from sightseeing.  Our task: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the fringes of known space for generations.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, avoiding hostile pirate factions, and dealing with the ever-present threat of subspace anomalies are just some of the dangers we face.  The galaxy is a vast and unforgiving place, but the hope of finding Xylos and bringing them home makes the risk worthwhile.
