
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a whispered legend amongst desert nomads, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, mirages mocked her thirst, and the endless expanse of sand threatened to swallow her whole. Yet, the glint of gold in her worn satchel, a relic from her deceased father, fueled her onward, a tangible link to the adventure that had become her life.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Kaito navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst colossal gas giants and dying stars.  Each jump across the vast gulf between galaxies was a gamble, a calculated risk against unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien patrols. The cargo manifest—a shipment of rare Xylossian crystals—was lucrative, but the true reward lay in the unexplored corners of the universe, each new system a canvas painted with the breathtaking, and often terrifying, artistry of the cosmos.
