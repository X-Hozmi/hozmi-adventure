
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Fiacre, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and treacherous mountain passes.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the unwavering faith in their destination fuelled their weary steps towards the distant, holy city.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista, a new challenge, a new story whispered on the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks kept her crew on edge.  The vast emptiness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, offered a stark contrast to the vibrant alien landscapes they encountered.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and distance, making each jump a leap into the unpredictable wonders and dangers of a galaxy far, far away.
