Each passing mile brought new challenges, from treacherous mountain passes to rogue bandits seeking their own fortune. The thrill of the unknown, the danger lurking around every bend, was a siren's call to Eldric's adventurous spirit. He yearned to test his courage against the wild elements and the creatures that inhabited them, knowing that true glory lay beyond the comfortable confines of his castle walls.
