
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her meager pack held only essential supplies – dried meat, a waterskin rapidly dwindling, and the worn map promising a legendary lost city nestled amidst the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each creak of her saddle and whinny of her loyal steed, Star, punctuated the silence, a stark contrast to the tales of bandits and mythical beasts whispered in taverns along her journey.  The thrill of the unknown, of pushing beyond the familiar edges of her world, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity, light years from the dying Earth.  The journey, a tapestry of warp jumps and asteroid fields, was a dance with fate, a testament to human ingenuity and the unending thirst for exploration.  Though the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly in his heart as it had in Elara's, a timeless echo across the vast chasm of time and space.
