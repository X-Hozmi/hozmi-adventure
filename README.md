
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Castilla.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, clinging to a tattered map promising a legendary spring said to cure the plague ravaging their homes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, starvation, or simply the brutal indifference of the landscape itself.  Yet, the possibility of salvation spurred her onward, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones lining her path.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of uncharted planets was a daily challenge, the vast emptiness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Unlike Elara, Ryla had technology, but the unknowns were just as perilous – hostile alien life, system failures, and the gnawing isolation of interstellar travel.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of connecting with humanity's past, pushed her forward into the cosmic unknown.
