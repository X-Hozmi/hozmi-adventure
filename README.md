
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the bleak, rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  This journey, fraught with peril, was her only chance.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil, charting a course towards the Xylos system.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast, inky expanse of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking galactic travel, propelled Ryla and her crew across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
