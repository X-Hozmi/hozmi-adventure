
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the rugged Breton countryside.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both danger and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, a testament to the perils and unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the violet nebula of Xylos, its hyperdrive hum a constant lullaby against the backdrop of infinite space.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity's sprawling interstellar empire.  While lacking the immediate physical threats of Elara's time, Ryla faced dangers of a different kind: treacherous wormholes, unpredictable alien lifeforms, and the ever-present possibility of system failure light-years from any known civilization. The vastness of space presented a unique challenge, a lonely adventure amongst the breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknown of the cosmos.
