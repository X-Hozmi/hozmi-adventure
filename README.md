
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  He carried only a worn map, his faith, and a desperate hope for survival, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship, kindness from unexpected strangers, and the ever-present shadow of death.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor life beyond human comprehension.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, held their breath as the planet materialized before them, a vibrant jewel in the inky blackness of space – a new frontier ripe with discovery and untold danger.
