
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions.  Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the harsh realities of a journey undertaken not for glory, but for the love of family, a journey that tests both body and spirit across a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the gravity of a newly discovered planet tugging at his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. His mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel is still a precarious dance with spacetime, each jump a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies and the lurking threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the infinite expanse of the cosmos, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, holds the promise of a new dawn, a new home, a future worth fighting for.
