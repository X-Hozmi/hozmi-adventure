
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a destination whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  He carried a tattered map, its edges frayed by countless journeys, a compass that sputtered erratically, and a heart brimming with the reckless hope of a seasoned adventurer.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in his quest for glory and perhaps, unimaginable riches.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek vessel capable of traversing the vast gulf between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, a cluster rumored to contain a planet brimming with a life-sustaining energy source vital to a dying Earth.  Navigating nebulae of shifting colours and dodging asteroid fields was second nature, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, where time itself warped and reality fractured at the edges of comprehension.  The reward, however, promised to rewrite the fate of humanity.
