
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's worn boots sunk into the earth. Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, felt like a lead weight on her shoulders.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows, wild beasts roamed the dense undergrowth, and the whispers of dark magic clung to the ancient trees. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic galaxy map shimmering around them.  Their hyperspace jump to Xylos, a planet teeming with rumored Xylanium crystals, had been rough, tossing the starship *Stardust* like a leaf in a galactic hurricane.  The Xylos system was notoriously dangerous, patrolled by Kryll pirates and plagued by unstable wormholes.  But the potential profit from the rare crystals, enough to secure the future of their struggling colony, made the risks worth taking.  The captain grinned, a glint of recklessness in his eyes.  "Prepare for docking, crew.  Fortune awaits."
