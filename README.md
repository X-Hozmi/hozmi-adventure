
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the pre-dawn light, spurred his destrier onwards.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort.  Ahead lay the unknown: rumored bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled lost city of Ys, whispered of in tavern tales, burned brighter than any fear.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort of his horse, was a heartbeat in the grand, perilous adventure unfolding before him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life forms unlike any encountered before.  The jump through hyperspace had been jarring, the navigation charts sketchy, and the ship's AI glitching intermittently.  But Eva, a veteran explorer hardened by countless voyages across the galactic expanse, felt the familiar thrill of discovery coursing through her veins. The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, held its breath as she approached the unknown.
