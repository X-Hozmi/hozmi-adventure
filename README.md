
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the wildness that surrounded her. Yet, the allure of Eldoria, whispered in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred her onwards, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward.  The stars streaked past the cockpit of the 'Stardust Drifter' in a blinding kaleidoscope of color as they jumped to warp speed, bound for Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Navigation charts flickered across the console, detailing the treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids that plagued the Xylos route. The mission was fraught with danger, but the potential rewards – an end to the millennia-long war – outweighed the risk.  Rexx gripped the controls, his knuckles white, a silent testament to the daunting expanse of the cosmos and the weight of his responsibility.
