
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Saint Aella, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows, the forest itself seemed to conspire against her with its tangled paths and unseen creatures. But the whisper of healing, the hope for her ailing brother, fueled her onward, each creak of the saddle a testament to her unwavering resolve.  

Millennia later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy was risky, pushing the boundaries of known warp technology, but the potential discovery of a new, habitable planet outweighed the danger.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the siren call of exploration echoed through the vast emptiness, guiding her ever onward.
