
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  Bandits, rumored to infest the Black Forest ahead, are a constant worry, overshadowed only by the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpens her senses, as she strives toward the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship the *Stardust Drifter* cutting a path through asteroid fields.  The hyperspace jump to Kepler-186f, a promising new colony world, is risky, the calculations delicate.  Alien encounters, from the playful space-whales of the nebula to the potentially hostile Kryll, are a constant threat.  But the lure of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and forging a new future for humanity compels Rexx and his crew onward, into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
