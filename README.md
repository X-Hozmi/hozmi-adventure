
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's summons had arrived, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged castle far to the east.  His journey was a tapestry woven with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, and yet the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, kept him pushing forward, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a far-flung galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted space were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas painted with stars and nebulas, presented a challenge unlike any faced by Thomas, but the spirit of adventure, the human desire to explore the infinite, burned as brightly in Eva's heart as it did in the medieval knight's.
