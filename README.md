
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glimmer of hope, the whispered tales of Eldoria's healing power, fueled his weary body and unwavering spirit, pushing him ever closer to his perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the nebula decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the gravitational pull of collapsing stars, Eva relied on her wits and advanced technology.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, presented a constant challenge, but the potential for discovery and the hope of finding survivors kept her engines humming, charting a course into the unknown.
