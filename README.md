
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her arduous journey. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to persevere, her heart fueled by a sibling's love and the whispers of legend.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a stark contrast to the swirling nebulae outside.  Her mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien civilizations, both benevolent and hostile, are everyday occurrences.  The vast expanse of the cosmos holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, but Eva and her crew press onward, driven by the hope of securing humanity's future among the stars.
