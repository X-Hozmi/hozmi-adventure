
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each step was a gamble against bandit ambushes and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened. Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promised the legendary city of Ys, a fabled haven beyond the mountains.  The whispers of its riches and hidden knowledge fueled her relentless journey, despite the constant perils of the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The interstellar jump had strained the ship's engines, and the eerie silence of deep space amplified the gnawing uncertainty of their quest.  But the faint signal, a desperate beacon flickering from the edge of the galaxy, spurred Rexx onward, a testament to humanity's unyielding thirst for exploration, even across the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
