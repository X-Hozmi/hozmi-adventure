
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rutted track a ribbon of mud snaking through the bleak, unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of saddle leather and whinny of our exhausted mounts was a testament to the perilous journey across the kingdom.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked us like a phantom.  Yet, the promise of a fabled city, rich in gold and ancient lore, spurred us onward, a shimmering beacon against the ever-present darkness.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  The Althea, a starship sleek as a predatory bird, sliced through the inky blackness, its trajectory charted across light-years to Kepler-186f.  Our mission: to establish a colony on this potentially habitable planet.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos both terrifying and exhilarating.  But the potential for discovery, for a new beginning amongst the tapestry of the galaxies, fueled our relentless pursuit.
