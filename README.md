
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, push onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, has taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers and desolate plains.  Bandits, lurking in shadowed forests, have tested their mettle, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the dangers of a vast, unpredictable land.

Centuries later, in 2742, Captain Elara Reyes pilots the starship *Stardust* across the void.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  Engine failures, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation are just some of the dangers she faces, yet the allure of discovery and the hope of finding her lost people drive her relentlessly forward, across the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
