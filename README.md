
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The biting wind whipped at my cloak as I surveyed the vast, snow-dusted plains stretching before me.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Samarkand, a whispered legend amongst travelers, a jewel promised at the end of a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching my destination, but every sunset brought the gnawing fear of failure.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the silence of interstellar space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, a terraforming project of monumental scale. Through the viewport, swirling nebulae painted vibrant streaks across the black canvas, a breathtaking backdrop to the mundane tasks of navigation and life support checks.  The journey was less fraught with immediate physical danger than my medieval ancestor's, but the isolation and the sheer immensity of space fostered a different kind of fear, the cold, relentless expanse of the unknown stretching before us.
