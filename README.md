
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her loyal steed, a sturdy grey mare named Lyra, struggling with the steep incline.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were constant threats, but the allure of the unknown spurred Elara onward, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The clinking of her father's ancient map, a worn parchment clutched in her hand, was the only comfort in the vast, echoing wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with promise but fraught with unpredictable atmospheric conditions.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the risks remained.  Pirate fleets, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of system failure made each jump a gamble with existence itself.  The weight of humanity's future rested on her shoulders, a burden far heavier than any medieval hardship.
