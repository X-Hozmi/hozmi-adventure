
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling my nostrils.  Ahead, the towering Alps loom, a formidable barrier between me and the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a few dried meats, and a well-worn map – are all that stand between me and the perils of the unforgiving wilderness: bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria's legendary treasures fuels my weary limbs, pushing me onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion.  Stars streak past the viewport in dazzling displays as we jump between galaxies, charting unknown nebulae and seeking out habitable planets.  The risks are different now – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  But the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration, remains the same primal urge that drove medieval travelers across continents, only now our quest is for a new Earth among the countless stars.
