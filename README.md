
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland.  Her worn leather satchel holds little beyond a few dried apricots and a chipped map, a lifeline in a world brimming with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Each sunrise brings the daunting prospect of another day's journey, each sunset the gnawing uncertainty of reaching her destination – a rumored monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The road is a tapestry woven with peril and hope, where the beauty of untamed nature clashes brutally with the harsh reality of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust*.  The vastness of space stretches before him, a canvas of swirling colours and unimaginable distances.  His mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the fringes of known space, a journey fraught with the risk of asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the mysterious anomalies that haunt the outer reaches of the galaxy.  Unlike Elara, Jax relies on advanced technology, but the sense of isolation and the weight of responsibility are no less profound, the cosmic expanse a constant reminder of the perilous beauty and the boundless unknown that lie ahead.
