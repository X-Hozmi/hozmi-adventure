
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and meager coin, held more than provisions; it contained the hopes of a desperate family, entrusted to her safekeeping.  Robbers, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the trials she faced as she navigated the treacherous mountain passes, each step a gamble in her arduous journey to reach the distant city of Avignon.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas swirling around her starship like a cosmic serpent.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the potential for navigational errors and unforeseen celestial events, was a calculated risk.  But the fate of millions, dependent on the information held within the core, spurred her on across the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
