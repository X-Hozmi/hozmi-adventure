
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery nestled in the Alps.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to overwhelm her already arduous journey.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing anxiety of reaching her destination before winter's grip tightened.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky black between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships demanded unwavering skill and courage. The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, tested her crew’s resilience as they pushed the boundaries of known space, their every jump a gamble against the unknown.
