
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his frame, spurred his mount onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track as he and his small company traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Zerzura, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glitter of galaxies, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying danger.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life forms, made each jump through hyperspace a gamble. But the promise of discovery, the chance to chart new worlds and expand humanity's reach, made the risks worthwhile.
