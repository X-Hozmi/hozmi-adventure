
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange. Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a map frayed at the edges, a few dried meats, and a worn dagger.  Ahead lay the rumored hidden monastery of Saint Fiacre, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill and terror of the unknown, a constant companion on her perilous journey across a land fraught with bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of war.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Lyra, scattered across the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was still a risky gamble, each jump a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  But the lure of discovery, the whispered promise of untold wonders and new civilizations, outweighed the danger, fueling her relentless pursuit across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
