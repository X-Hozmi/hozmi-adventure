
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a relic said to hold the power of a thousand suns, from the clutches of the sorcerer Malkor.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of stars and distant galaxies, held its own brand of peril – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed on, fueled by hope and the unwavering belief that somewhere, amongst the cosmic dust, lay the answer to Kepler-186f's disappearance.
