
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley collection of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-caked track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Each dawn brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred them onward, their hope a flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving darkness of the medieval world.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for excitement, terror, or both.


Centuries hence,  the sleek starship *Starseeker* cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Captain Elara Vance, her face etched with the weariness of a thousand jumps, steered her vessel through a nebula of breathtaking beauty and terrifying radiation storms.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of cosmic wonder and existential dread; the thrill of discovery pitted against the chilling reality of alien encounters and the constant threat of system malfunctions in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
