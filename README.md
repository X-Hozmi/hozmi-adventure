
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Montsegur.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of every crumbling ruin, and the whispers of plague stalked the land, yet Elara pressed on, her spirit fueled by a thirst for adventure and the unwavering loyalty to her King.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a pulse of excitement in her arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations for slower vessels.  Eva, however, commanded a ship equipped with experimental warp drives, capable of bending space-time itself.  The thrill of discovery was intoxicating, far eclipsing the dangers of navigating uncharted star systems and encountering unknown alien lifeforms. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a testament to human ingenuity and the boundless quest for the next frontier.
