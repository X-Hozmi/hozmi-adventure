
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – bandits, lost pilgrims, or perhaps a hidden monastery brimming with forgotten wisdom.  The scent of unfamiliar spices and the distant call of a hawk were constant companions on her journey east, a pilgrimage driven by a whispered prophecy and the burning desire to find her missing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula of Xylos, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the threat of rogue asteroids or hostile alien encounters lurking around every corner.  The cosmos, a vast and terrifying ocean of stars, promised unimaginable discoveries and equally terrifying perils.
