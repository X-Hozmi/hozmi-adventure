
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of silks, spices, and untold riches pushes us onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for adventure.  The creak of cart wheels and the bleating of sheep are the soundtrack to our perilous journey, a symphony of hope and desperation played out against the vast canvas of the medieval world.


Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The 'Starseeker', a vessel built of dreams and stardust, hurtles through the inky black, its destination a nebula whispered about in hushed tones across the galactic community.  Beyond the known systems, dangers lurk: rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the silent, watchful eyes of ancient, unknowable entities. But the crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, presses on, driven by the insatiable need to understand the universe and the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the cosmos. Their journey is one of scientific discovery, but also a modern-day odyssey filled with risk and the promise of breathtaking revelation.
