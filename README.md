
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the rugged terrain of the Holy Roman Empire was far from luxurious;  sleep was snatched in the shadow of crumbling castles, food a meager mix of dried meat and hardtack.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispers of ancient ruins and fabled cities, fueled her onward.  Each creaking cart wheel, each murmuring stream, held the promise of adventure, a stark contrast to the mundane life she'd left behind.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Unlike Elara's arduous trek, Eva's journey was a dance among the stars,  a symphony of warp drives and hyperspace jumps. The vast canvas of the cosmos offered breathtaking views of alien planets, swirling nebulas, and distant galaxies—a spectacle unimaginable to the medieval traveler.  But even in this technologically advanced age, the sense of adventure remained; the thrill of the unknown, the potential for discovery, and the unwavering spirit of exploration bound them both.
