
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each creaking wooden bridge, each muddy ford, each wary glance exchanged with fellow travelers, fueled her determination.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispers of plague stalked the land, but the lure of Ys, and the whispered secrets it held, spurred her onwards into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Cosmic rays crackled against the hull, and the endless expanse of stars both awed and humbled her.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the galaxy.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, far outweighed the risks, and Ryla steered her ship towards the unknown depths of space, a lone explorer charting a course through the vast cosmic ocean.
