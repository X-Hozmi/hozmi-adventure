
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of St. Alba – led him through treacherous passes, across whispering plains haunted by bandits, and into the heart of a whispering forest where ancient magic clung to the air like morning mist. Each sunrise brought new perils:  starvation, the threat of wild beasts, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile lords.  Yet, the glint of the lost relic fueled his determination, pushing him ever onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, AURORA, calmly reporting navigational data.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system and locate the rumored lost colony of New Eden.  The vast expanse of space held its own unique dangers: rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile alien species. Eva, however, was undeterred; the thrill of discovery and the promise of unveiling the mysteries of the cosmos outweighed any fear. The journey, across light years and unimaginable distances, was a testament to human ingenuity and unyielding courage.
