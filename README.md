
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his battered chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his weary steed onward.  The King's writ, a crumpled parchment clutched in his gauntlet, promised riches and glory in the far east, but the reality was dust-choked roads, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the gnawing hunger in his belly. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the ever-present dangers of this perilous journey across the known world.  He pushed on, driven by a mixture of ambition and sheer stubborn survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate was a daily occurrence.  But the thrill of discovery, the potential for uncovering new life and technologies beyond human comprehension, fueled her relentless pursuit.  The vastness of space, a constant companion, held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble with fate.
