
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudges onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the sense of peril.  Bandit raids are a constant threat, and the unforgiving landscape itself – scorching deserts, treacherous mountain passes – tests his endurance and resolve at every turn.  His only companions are the stars, a stubborn mule, and the unwavering hope that fuels his arduous journey.


Centuries later, Elara pilots her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigation is treacherous; celestial anomalies threaten to tear her vessel apart, and the vast emptiness of space presses in.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, pushes Elara onward.  Across light-years, she chases a whisper of hope, a beacon in the infinite darkness.
