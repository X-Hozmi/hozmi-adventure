
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  Ahead, the snow-capped peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Zerzura.  He carried a tattered map, its promises of untold riches and exotic spices a fragile counterpoint to the gnawing hunger in his belly and the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the brutal uncertainties of the medieval landscape. Each sunrise brought the hope of discovery, but every sunset the cold reality of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Vast, swirling colours painted the viewport as she charted a course across unmapped galaxies, her destination a distant planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity’s relentless push beyond the known.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push boundaries, remained a constant through the ages.
