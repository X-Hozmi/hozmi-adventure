
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, resting on the ancient map promising a hidden valley overflowing with fertile land.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar colonization.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer. The risks were immense, but the reward—a future for humanity among the stars—was worth the unimaginable odds.
