His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and recover the Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of whispering forests haunted by brigands and beasts.

Yet, the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a new beginning for humanity, fueled her intrepid spirit and pushed her ever forward into the unknown.
