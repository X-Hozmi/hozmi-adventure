
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising riches in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the price for seeking fortune and glory across the known world.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience. This journey, fraught with peril, was her life’s adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was a daunting opponent, filled with unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Advanced technology offered a glimmer of hope against the dangers, but the human spirit of exploration, that same fire that drove Elara centuries before, was the true fuel propelling Eva across the galactic void.
