The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the endless expanse of the Breton countryside stretching before him.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse.

The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of discovery – new civilizations, alien lifeforms, and perhaps, the answers to questions humanity had pondered for millennia.
