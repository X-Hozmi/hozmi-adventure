
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving plains of Anatolia in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and the cryptic map promising a lost city brimming with untold riches – or perhaps, untold dangers.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush, wild beast, or the creeping despair of a journey far from home.  The air tasted of salt and distant storms, a fitting prelude to the unknown that lay ahead.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet shrouded in mystery.  The journey had already claimed months, traversing wormholes and dodging rogue asteroids, the ship's AI a constant companion against the isolating vastness of space.  The thrill of discovery warred with the gnawing fear of the unknown, a cosmic echo of Elara's medieval trek – the human spirit's enduring quest for something more, beyond the familiar horizon.
