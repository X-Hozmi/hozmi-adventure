
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds a tattered map, her only guide to the fabled monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step of her mount is a gamble; bandits roam these paths, and the whispers of mythical beasts echo through the windswept valleys.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the desperate hope for healing fuels her onward, a small flicker against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and cosmic dust, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperspace jumps are a calculated risk, fraught with the possibility of encountering rogue asteroids or worse – alien entities whose intentions remain unknown. The rewards, however, are potentially limitless, driving Rexx and his crew through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
