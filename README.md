
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and whispers of a monstrous beast guarding a vital mountain pass fueled their every fear.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain paths to bartering for scarce provisions in isolated villages.  Their adventure wasn't just about reaching their destination, but about the forging of a bond between man and boy, tested by the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable temporal distortions near the Kepler system.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown expanse of the galaxy, but the promise of scientific advancement and the thrill of exploration fueled her intrepid spirit.
