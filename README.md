
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the harsh sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura had taken her through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts where mirages danced cruelly on the horizon, and through forests teeming with bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brought new challenges – foraging for food, negotiating with suspicious villagers, and constantly battling the gnawing fear of the unknown.  The reward, she hoped, would be worth the relentless hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered his starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across intergalactic space demanded absolute precision, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational pulls.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  The vast, inky blackness held both wonder and terror, the silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship and the crackling static of the comms system.  The journey was perilous, but the potential discovery fueled his unwavering resolve.
