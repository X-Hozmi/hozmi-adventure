
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant King for aid against the encroaching famine.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the glint of the distant Alps, a promise of progress and salvation, spurred her onward despite the perils of the medieval road.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue nebulae, and combating the ever-present threat of space pirates, Ryla's journey was as perilous in its own way as Elara's.  But the promise of a galaxy-spanning peace fueled her crew, pushing them toward the unknown and a future determined not by fate but by their bravery and resourcefulness.
