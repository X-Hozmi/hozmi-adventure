
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the fractured lands of Francia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and whispers of a plague stalked the villages she passed.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the hope of reaching her estranged brother in the distant city of Avignon fueled her weary steps.  The scent of woodsmoke and the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer were small comforts on a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity scattered across a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel were routine hazards on her interstellar voyage.  The weight of responsibility for the hundreds of colonists on board pressed heavily, a burden far greater than any bandit or storm. But the glimmer of a new home, a fresh start amidst the cold beauty of space, made the unimaginable journey worthwhile.
