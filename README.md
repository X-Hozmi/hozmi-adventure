
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his chainmail rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate flight from bandits who had plundered their caravan.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the harsh beauty of the English countryside – sun-drenched fields giving way to dark, forbidding forests.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, each sunset the fragile hope of reaching sanctuary.  Their survival depended on cunning, courage, and the unwavering loyalty of their small band.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, had already consumed years, punctuated by perilous asteroid fields and encounters with unknown spacefaring civilizations.  Advanced technology lessened the physical hardships, but the emotional toll of isolation and the ever-present threat of system failures tested her crew's resolve. The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, was a constant companion.
