
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, spurred his destrier onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the dust choking the parched plains they’d crossed for weeks.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fueled his weary bones, pushing him ever closer to his perilous goal.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, held its own unique brand of danger.  Uncharted asteroid fields, temporal anomalies that threatened to rip the ship apart, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each warp jump a gamble.  But the promise of a new home for humanity, a chance to forge a future amongst the stars, made the risks worthwhile.  The cosmos stretched before her, a vast and unforgiving ocean of possibilities.
