
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map promising the legendary city of Ys, a shimmering jewel said to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled both her fear and her relentless pursuit of this whispered dream, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its hyperdrive hum a constant lullaby against the vast, inky blackness.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a region rumored to contain planets brimming with unfathomable resources and equally unfathomable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and deciphering cryptic alien signals became a daily routine, the endless expanse of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  The universe unfolded before them, a breathtaking tapestry of wonders and perils, each jump to warp speed a leap into the unknown.
