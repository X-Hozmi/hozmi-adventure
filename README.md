
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her horse picks its way across the parched Breton countryside.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty; bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and whispered rumors of plague stalk the land like a phantom.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – is a perilous one, requiring not only courage and resilience but also the cunning to navigate treacherous terrain and suspicious villages.  The vast, untamed landscape itself is an adversary, demanding strength and resourcefulness from those who dare to traverse it.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  jumps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the edge of explored space, a journey fraught with the danger of uncharted wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  Each jump is a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the vast indifference of the universe.  The cosmos, vast and unforgiving, tests the limits of both technology and human endurance.
