
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just food and water; it holds the hopes of her family, the meager inheritance she carries to her estranged uncle in the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sparks a surge of apprehension and excitement.  Bandits, storms, and starvation are constant companions on this journey, but the allure of a new life, a chance to escape the crushing poverty of her village, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the control panel, the holographic map of the Andromeda galaxy shimmering around him. His starship, *The Wanderer*, shuddered as it jumped through hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Their mission: to locate the legendary planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The dangers are different now – hostile alien races, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of system failures – but the thrill of discovery, the insatiable human need to explore the unknown, remains the same powerful driving force.
