
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the King's ailing daughter.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of glory, spurred them on through blizzards and scorching heat, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Faster-than-light travel brought them across unimaginable distances, but the vastness of space held its own perils: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown and hostile life forms.  Yet, the hope of finding a new home, a beacon of life amidst the cosmic darkness, propelled them forward, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
