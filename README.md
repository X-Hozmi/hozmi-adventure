
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager sustenance in impoverished villages.  Their adventure was not one of glory, but of endurance, a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome hardship.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millions of light-years.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Eva faced dangers of a different scale – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the thrill of discovery fueled her onward, a testament to humanity's insatiable curiosity and relentless pursuit of the unknown.
