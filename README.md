
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Elara’s small caravan struggled onward.  Dust coated everything, blurring the already indistinct horizon.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Zerzura, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, starvation gnawed at their bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each creaking wagon wheel, their determination grew, fueled by whispered tales of unimaginable riches and a sacred oasis waiting at the journey's end.  The vast unknown stretched before them, a tapestry woven with both terror and exhilarating possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate a habitable planet within the newly discovered Kepler-186f system.  The journey was a relentless test of endurance, a constant battle against cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar space.  But the lure of discovering new life, of charting unmapped constellations and potentially establishing a new human colony, propelled them forward. The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror, but the promise of discovery burned brighter than any star.
