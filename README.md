
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant war.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the hope of returning home a hero.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Sol system, a journey fraught with peril.

But the promise of interstellar commerce, and the sheer thrill of exploration, spurred them on towards the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
