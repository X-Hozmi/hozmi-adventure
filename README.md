
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Each creak of our saddle, each snort from our tired horses, punctuated the silence broken only by the distant caw of a raven. Ahead lay the rumored riches of a forgotten abbey, whispered of in taverns and sung in ballads – a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and treacherous mountain passes, a gamble for glory and survival against the backdrop of a world steeped in superstition and uncertainty.  Every step was a test of endurance, a dance with fate itself.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebula ahead, a cosmic gateway to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The journey had taken years, a trial of patience and precision navigation through asteroid fields and treacherous wormholes, a constant battle against the unforgiving void. Yet, the allure of Xylos, its promise of a future free from the interstellar conflicts that plagued her people, fueled her onward, a testament to human ambition reaching for the stars.
