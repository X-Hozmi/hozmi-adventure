He carried a king's decree, a dangerous mission to deliver a vital message across the treacherous, bandit-ridden lands separating the warring kingdoms. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down his spine, reminding him of the ever-present peril.  He dreamt not of riches, but of home, and a safe return from this perilous adventure across a landscape both breathtaking and deadly.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey, fraught with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, was a test of both skill and courage.  But the lure of discovery, of charting unmapped galaxies and potentially finding life beyond humanity’s grasp, fueled her onward, a modern-day explorer venturing where no human had gone before.
