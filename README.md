
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Each step is a gamble; bandits lurk in the shadows of the ancient forests, and the whispers of plague follow her like a malevolent phantom.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, every sunrise a fresh challenge against the brutal beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a gamble that could reshape the future of humanity.  Asteroids threaten to tear through her vessel, while unknown alien lifeforms lurk in the unexplored reaches of space.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the vastness of the cosmos, drives her forward, a lone adventurer charting a course across the uncharted territories of the future.
