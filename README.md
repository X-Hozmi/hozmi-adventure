Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a potential ambush by bandits or a glimpse of something far more sinister.

Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships added to the thrill, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amongst the stars.  The search for habitable worlds was a dangerous but exhilarating pursuit;  the universe, a vast and perilous ocean of possibility.
