
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The King's ransom, a chest brimming with gold and jewels, was strapped securely behind the saddle.  Their journey across the treacherous highlands had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, sudden storms lashing them with hail, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers that lay between him and his destination, a distant castle shrouded in the mist of legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts was child's play compared to the unknown terrors that lurked within the derelict station, the whispers of a long-dead civilization echoing in the void. The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and deadly silence, testing her courage and resourcefulness with each passing jump through hyperspace.
