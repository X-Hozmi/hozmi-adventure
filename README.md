
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a mission to broker peace between warring lords.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dense undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, disease, or the treacherous terrain itself. Yet, the glint of distant mountains and the whispered promises of distant lands fueled her onward, a testament to the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the challenges remained: treacherous asteroid fields, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  The vastness of the cosmos offered unimaginable rewards, but also a stark reminder of humanity's fragility in the face of the unknown.
