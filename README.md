
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort against the vast unknown stretching ahead.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of trepidation and exhilaration, the promise of adventure outweighing the ever-present peril.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the 'Starseeker', a swirling nebula painting vibrant colours across the viewport.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-like planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The journey, measured in lightyears, was punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the quiet efficiency of the ship’s crew.  Unlike Thomas, her challenges weren't bandits or starvation, but the unpredictable nature of space itself; solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, both benevolent and hostile.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held the same allure of the unknown, the same thrill of discovery, as the medieval world, only on a scale that dwarfed even the most ambitious earthly adventures.
