
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sluggish serpent of pack animals and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the rumored city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the sparse scrub, sends a shiver down our spines, for the whispers of bandits and monstrous desert creatures are as real as the burning sun above.  We seek fortune, or perhaps only escape, in the legendary oasis, a gamble with fate played out under the indifferent gaze of the vast, unforgiving sky.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from light and dreams, leaps across the void between galaxies, its trajectory a line etched against the cosmic tapestry.  We are explorers, charting unknown nebulae and seeking out the whispers of other civilizations in the static of space.  The thrill of discovery is matched only by the terrifying reality of the unknown – hostile alien life, catastrophic gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any rescue.  The universe is a breathtaking canvas, but its beauty is tinged with the ever-present danger of the infinite.
