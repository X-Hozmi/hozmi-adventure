
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a destination whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling campfires.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself – but the lure of Eldoria's mythical treasures, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and beauty, a testament to the human spirit's relentless pursuit of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches in rare earth elements and the potential discovery of sentient life.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking canvas of swirling colors and celestial wonders, was as perilous as any medieval wilderness.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of space pirates tested her skills and the ship's resilience. Yet, the allure of the unexplored, the possibility of making first contact, fueled Nova's courageous expedition into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
