
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing all she owned.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far less frightening than the reason for her journey: to find her brother, lost amongst the crusaders in the Holy Land.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, spurred her onward, a testament to the unwavering sisterly bond driving her across a continent rife with peril and uncertainty.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offered a fragile hope, a momentary respite before the next leg of her arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas clouds a stark contrast to the cool blue of her navigation screen.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a routine but crucial task in the ongoing galactic trade war.  While space pirates posed a threat far less immediate than a medieval ambush, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present danger of equipment malfunctions made every journey a gamble.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, served as a constant reminder of humanity's fragile grasp on the infinite.
