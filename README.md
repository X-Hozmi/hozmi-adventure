
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Reginald's saddle as he guides his destrier across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders fuel his weary spirit, driving him onward despite the hardships of the long and uncertain journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel allows for rapid transit between star systems, but the vast distances and unpredictable celestial phenomena still present immense dangers.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the chilling emptiness of space are constant threats, yet Eva presses on, driven by the hope of finding a new home amidst the glittering expanse of the cosmos.
