
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward. The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort.  Each rustle of leaves whispered of potential ambush, each shadow hinted at lurking danger.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Chateau Blanc, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The reward?  Not gold or glory, but the hope of saving innocent lives and upholding his knightly oath.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky expanse of space, punctuated by the dazzling brilliance of distant stars and nebulas, held both wonder and terror.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space debris was a constant battle, while the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies kept her crew on edge.  The stakes?  The future of humanity and the chance to discover a new home among the stars.
