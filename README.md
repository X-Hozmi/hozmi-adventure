
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddlebag held the promise of another day closer to the mythical city of Ys, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The whispering wind carried tales of magic and monsters, fueling her determination as much as it stoked her fear. This pilgrimage, undertaken for a lost love, was a gamble against fate itself, a race against time and the encroaching darkness of the approaching winter.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s vibrant hues, charting a course through unmapped galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, scanned the cosmos for habitable planets, facing dangers far beyond the grasp of medieval travelers.  Wormholes promised shortcuts, but also unpredictable gravitational shifts and the lurking threat of cosmic storms.  The quest for new worlds, fuelled by humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery, demanded bravery, ingenuity, and a tolerance for the unimaginable vastness and unpredictable dangers of interstellar travel.
