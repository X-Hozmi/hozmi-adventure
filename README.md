
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to be fighting with a mercenary company in the distant lands of Italy. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges she faced on her epic journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of space.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable behavior of alien space-faring creatures posed constant threats to her crew and their fragile vessel.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to uncover the mysteries of the cosmos, spurred them onward, their hearts filled with the thrill of intergalactic exploration.
