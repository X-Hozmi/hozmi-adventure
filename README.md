
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering tapestry of worn leather and anxious faces, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – the whispered legends of bandit-infested forests, the promise of bustling trading cities, and the ever-present fear of the untamed wilderness.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the tall grass, heightens the sense of peril and adventure. We are bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with danger, but rich with the allure of untold riches and whispered magic.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive fills the bridge.  Stars streak past in vibrant smears of colour as we jump between galaxies, a voyage spanning millennia in mere moments.  The destinations:  newly discovered planets teeming with alien life, some welcoming, some hostile.  The risks are immense – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien species. But the reward?  Uncharted worlds ripe for exploration, the potential to uncover life beyond our wildest imaginings, and to expand humanity’s reach among the cosmos.
