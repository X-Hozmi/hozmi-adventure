
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World mountains, a legendary barrier separating his homeland from the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown hedgerows, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any map.  His journey was a gamble, a desperate hope woven into the fabric of his ragged clothes and the unwavering glint in his eye.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of cosmic wonders visible through the cockpit's panoramic viewport.  But the serene beauty was deceptive; asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made interstellar travel a perilous undertaking, demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.  The vastness of space held its own treasures and terrors, a stark contrast to the limited, yet still dangerous, landscape of Thomas's journey.
