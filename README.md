
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues. His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King across the treacherous, bandit-infested Black Forest, felt more perilous with each passing league.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down his spine, a constant reminder of the unknown dangers lurking in the shadows.  He pressed on, driven by duty and a flicker of hope that he would reach his destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic colours. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would test the limits of both her ship and her courage.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of space pirates, Eva relied on her wits and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vastness of space offered stunning beauty, but also held unimaginable dangers – a true test of human resilience in the face of the infinite.
