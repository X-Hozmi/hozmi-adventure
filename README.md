
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush by bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the mythical creatures whispered about in hushed tones by the villagers.  Survival, let alone success, seemed a distant dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble to find a new source of vital energy crystals.  Navigation was treacherous, battling cosmic storms and navigating asteroid fields while evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll, a hostile insectoid species that controlled the lucrative trade routes.  The vast emptiness of space, though awe-inspiring, held a constant undercurrent of dread – a single malfunction could mean the end of her journey, and perhaps, her life.
