
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each step eastward, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it promised, fueled his weary bones and spurred him relentlessly onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers, and repairing critical systems under the strain of warp-drive travel were all in a day's work.  But the vastness of space, the sheer breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, held a pull as strong as any medieval legend, promising both unimaginable peril and untold riches to those daring enough to explore its depths.
