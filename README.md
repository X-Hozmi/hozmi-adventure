
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them on, their journey a testament to the unwavering human spirit in the face of adversity.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Warp jumps brought them across unimaginable distances, each one a gamble against unknown gravitational forces and hostile alien lifeforms. Yet, the vastness of space, while terrifying, held a profound beauty, and the promise of discovery fueled Elara's relentless pursuit of a new beginning for humankind.
