
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping at her worn cloak.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage promised in whispered legends, had been fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes in sun-baked canyons, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested her resilience.  Yet, the stories of Zerzura's shimmering spires and untold riches fueled her onward, each sunrise a fresh chance to conquer another league of unforgiving terrain.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s swirling gases.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a cluster of planets rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space kraken known as the Void Serpent, Ryla and her crew faced the immense cosmic unknown. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted darkness where the laws of physics bent and broke, but the promise of galactic exploration burned brighter than any star.
