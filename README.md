
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the glint of gold in the stories, coupled with a thirst for the unknown, spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and discoveries.  

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kryll crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political intrigue back on Earth. But the vastness of space, filled with untold wonders and dangers, captivated her more than any terrestrial ambition ever could.  The journey was the prize.
