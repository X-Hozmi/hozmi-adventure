
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean still clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way through the sun-baked Provençal countryside, then into the shadow of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in mountain passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of exotic spices and distant lands, spurred us onward, each sunrise painting a fresh canvas of adventure across the vast, uncharted landscape.

Centuries later, the stars are our canvas.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the void, navigating by the faint glow of distant nebulae.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, rumored to harbor life.  The journey is a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of the engines and the occasional burst of static from the comms system.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders unseen by human eyes before, and the potential for discovery fuel my determination.  This is not just travel; it's exploration on a cosmic scale, a pilgrimage to the very edge of the known universe.
