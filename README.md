The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Ys before the solstice – pressed heavily upon him.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and adventure. He carried with him not just a map and meager supplies, but the weight of a kingdom's hope resting on his shoulders.

Across the light-years, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy fields, cut a path through the swirling colours.  The mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly-discovered planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with possibility and unknown dangers.  With her loyal crew at her side, Eva faced the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate raids, all in pursuit of a future for humankind amongst the stars.
