
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a testament to the miles swallowed since leaving Canterbury.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, carried the distant cry of a hawk.  Ahead, the imposing silhouette of the Pyrenees Mountains promised both challenge and respite.  Bandits, hunger, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown – the whispered tales of distant lands and exotic spices – spurred me onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving beauty of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a lullaby against the backdrop of swirling nebulae.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey, measured in light-years rather than leagues, was a breathtaking dance through the cosmos, each jump a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies.  The crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and scientists, shared the same yearning for discovery, the same exhilaration in facing the infinite expanse, a far cry from the constrained horizons of our terrestrial ancestors.
