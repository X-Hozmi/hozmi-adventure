
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each howling wolf, each murmuring brook served as a reminder of the perils awaiting – bandits, disease, and the unforgiving landscape itself. Yet, the hope in her heart burned brighter than any campfire, fueling her onward through the sprawling, untamed wilderness of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns, held a beauty as breathtaking as it was terrifying.  But the thought of the colonists, their lives hanging in the balance, pushed Ryla and her crew across the galaxy, their resolve as strong as the hyperdrive powering their ship.
