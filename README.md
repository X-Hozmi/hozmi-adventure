
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map promising a legendary lost city nestled amidst treacherous mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack; every sunrise brought renewed hope, and every nightfall, gnawing fear.  This journey, fraught with peril, was her only chance to reclaim her family's stolen legacy.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Zydonian cruisers, Rexx relied on his instincts and the ship's battered hyperdrive. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, both terrified and awed him. This was more than a mission; it was a gamble, a desperate race against the encroaching darkness of a galactic empire.
