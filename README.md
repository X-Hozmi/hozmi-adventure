
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, a biting wind whipping at my cloak.  Each step was a gamble; one wrong footing could send me tumbling into the icy chasm below.  My meager supplies, a map older than myself, and the fading light were my only companions on this desperate journey to reach the rumored monastery holding the cure for my brother's illness. The whispers of bandits and mythical beasts only added to the thrill of the unknown, fueling my resolve despite the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebula before them – the Xylos Gate, a treacherous shortcut to the Andromeda galaxy.  This wasn't a quest for a cure, but for a new beginning for humanity.  The risks were immense – uncharted space, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failure. Yet, the lure of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and potentially a new home, far outweighed the peril, propelling her and her crew across the unforgiving expanse of space.
