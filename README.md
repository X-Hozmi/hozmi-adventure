
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching her estranged brother in Avignon before winter's grip tightened.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  Yet, the lure of reunion, of familial bonds stronger than any hardship, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth, but Ryla's steely resolve never faltered.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both terrifying wonders and breathtaking beauty, a tapestry woven with danger and the exhilarating promise of discovery.
