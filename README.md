
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its edges frayed from countless journeys.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unpredictable elements.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, spurred her onward.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets made the risks worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, speckled with distant suns and uncharted systems, held both wonder and terrifying uncertainty.  Navigation glitches, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were just some of the hazards of interstellar travel. But Ava, fueled by the hopes of humanity for a new home, pressed on, her eyes fixed on the distant gleam of a possible future amongst the stars.
