
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog from a distant village, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, danger, and the unknown, a constant companion on her perilous journey across a vast and unpredictable land.  Bandits, storms, and treacherous terrain were merely stepping stones on her path to salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Warp jumps across light years, encounters with alien species both friendly and hostile, and the constant threat of rogue asteroids were commonplace hazards on her journey, a thrilling yet precarious dance with the vast expanse of the cosmos.
