
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the blistered plains of Aquitaine had been brutal; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked him relentlessly.  He carried a king's ransom, a secret map promising untold riches hidden in a forgotten monastery,  his only companions the gnawing hunger in his belly and the distant, haunting cry of a lone wolf.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle against the elements and the uncertainties of the road, his adventure a constant test of courage and endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would span light-years and untold dangers.  Nebula storms threatened to rip apart her ship, unknown alien lifeforms lurked in the void, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive pressed in on her senses. But the hope of finding her lost kin, of uncovering the secrets of the vanished colony, fueled her determination, propelling her ever onward into the breathtaking and terrifying immensity of space.
