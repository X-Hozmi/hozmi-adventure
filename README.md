
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, desperate scrambles for water in parched landscapes, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the stark reality of their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing systems damaged by solar flares were all in a day’s work.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and deadly hazards, was a far cry from the medieval landscapes of old, yet the spirit of adventure – the thrill of the unknown, the unwavering pursuit of a distant goal – remained the same.
