
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the ever-present threat of the plague that had already ravaged her village.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance both physical and mental, but the hope of saving her brother fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey through uncharted space teeming with cosmic anomalies and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging solar flares, and repairing warp drive malfunctions were commonplace occurrences.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also a lonely and isolating expanse,  but the possibility of finding her missing kin – and uncovering the secrets of the lost colony – propelled her ever deeper into the unknown.
