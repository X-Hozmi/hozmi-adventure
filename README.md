
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, its shadows teeming with whispered tales of bandits and mythical beasts.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.  He carried a king's ransom – and a king's desperate plea – across hostile lands, a perilous journey fueled by duty and the burning hope of reaching his destination before winter's icy grip claimed him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to a newly discovered planet, a world teeming with promise yet shrouded in unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, but the vastness of the cosmos remained a constant, awe-inspiring, and sometimes terrifying reminder of the challenges facing humanity's expansion across the galaxy.
