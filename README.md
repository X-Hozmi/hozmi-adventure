
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry woven with emerald fields and shadowed forests – each a potential hiding place for bandits or worse.  Her worn leather satchel held the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message across the war-torn land. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of the unknown dangers that lay ahead, a constant companion on her arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Millions of stars glittered like cosmic diamonds scattered across the void, each a potential destination, a gateway to uncharted systems and alien civilizations.  Her journey to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace, was fraught with its own perils:  unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks. The vastness of space was a breathtaking spectacle, yet also a lonely and unforgiving expanse that tested the courage and resilience of every interstellar explorer.
