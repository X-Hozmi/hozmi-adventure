
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  His journey across the Holy Roman Empire, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the chivalrous tales sung in taverns.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the spirit of adventure burned brighter than the midday sun, fueled by faith and the promise of a distant, sacred shrine.  He traded stories and shared meager meals with fellow travelers, their shared hardships forging a bond stronger than steel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate Earth.  The vastness of space offered wonders beyond imagination—pulsating nebulas that painted the cosmos with vibrant hues, gravity-defying asteroid fields that demanded precise navigation, and the haunting silence between stars punctuated only by the hum of her ship’s engines. But the solitude was a burden, the weight of her responsibility pressing down as heavily as the vacuum of space.  Each new star system represented a gamble, a potential treasure trove or a deadly trap.
