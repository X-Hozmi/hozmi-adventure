
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a stark contrast to the exotic spices whispered about in the taverns of Constantinople, his destination.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the vast, unpredictable landscape of Europe and the Levant.  Each sunrise held the promise of adventure, and each nightfall brought the chilling uncertainty of survival.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Elara Reyes navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation systems.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of celestial storms, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, promising untold riches and potentially, utter annihilation.
