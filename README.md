
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of disease stalked the crowded market towns.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the sacred shrine, and the tales of its miraculous power, spurred them onward through the harsh, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unknown – alien life forms, unexplored anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any known civilization.  The vast expanse of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, testing the limits of human ingenuity and courage.
