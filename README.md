
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the distant silhouette of the Pyrenees Mountains a cruel promise of miles yet to travel.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a tattered map, guiding her on a desperate journey to find a rumored healer for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous adventure, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of uncertainty and the quiet determination to reach her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of uncharted space, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system failure.  His crew, a ragtag bunch of seasoned explorers and hardened mercenaries, relied on him to bring them home, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
