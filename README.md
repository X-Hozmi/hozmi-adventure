
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, chafed her shoulders.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the nights. Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and powerful magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of starvation and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the dangers remained:  pirates lurking in asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes spitting them into uncharted territories, and the ever-present threat of void-born creatures that stalked the inky black between stars.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey fraught with peril, but a promise of untold scientific discoveries and perhaps, the key to humanity's survival.
