
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone Shrine, had already claimed several pack animals and tested the limits of their endurance.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of the Shrine's power, the promise of untold riches and healing, fueled their weary steps towards the horizon.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a journey fraught with danger.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of Xylos and beyond, outweighed any risk. The vastness of space, however, was as lonely and unpredictable as any medieval wilderness.
