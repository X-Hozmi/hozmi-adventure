
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of my weary horse as we crested the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance like a mirage.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken us through sun-baked plains, across treacherous mountain passes, and through forests dark enough to swallow the sun.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the chilling possibility of disease, and the ever-present hunger, but the thrill of the journey, the hope of reaching the papal court, fueled our onward progress. The reward for our trials remained unseen, but the adventure itself was already etched into our souls.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' cut a lonely path through the nebula of Xylos, its engines a low hum against the vast silence of space.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet potentially teeming with life, is imminent.  Though the dangers are different – radiation storms, hostile alien species, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – the same thrill of discovery courses through me.  This is not simply a voyage; it's a leap into the unknown, a pilgrimage to the edge of human knowledge, a quest for something beyond our wildest dreams.
