
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his squire Thomas, and their worn packhorses trudge through the mud of a French byway, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the incessant drizzle.  Their quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test their resolve, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the damp air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in their arduous pilgrimage across a continent teeming with both beauty and brutality.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the bridge.  Their mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, seeking new habitable worlds for a desperately overpopulated Earth.  Warp jumps are risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of their isolation. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the promise of new life, fuels their tireless exploration across the unfathomable distances between stars.
