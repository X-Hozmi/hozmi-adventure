
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, icy rivers threatened to sweep her away, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each ache in her bones, fueled her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Zara piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the planet Kepler-186f, a jewel orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable spacetime distortions within the nebula itself.  The vastness of space, the sheer unimaginable distance from home, and the ever-present threat of catastrophic system failure made this galactic expedition a far cry from a simple supply run – a true test of courage and skill.
