
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots slapped against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed. The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and distant wolves.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled haven whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, a city said to hold the secret to eternal life.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements, but the lure of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, propelled me onward, my pack heavier with hope than with supplies.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet teeming with strange, bioluminescent flora and rumored to house the lost archives of the Ancients.  Navigation was a dance with astrophysical anomalies and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a leap of faith. The crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, were bound together by a shared hunger for discovery and a healthy respect for the perilous nature of traversing the cosmos.  The universe held countless wonders, and we were determined to claim our share.
