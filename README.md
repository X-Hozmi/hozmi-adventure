
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains, her worn leather satchel bumping against her thigh.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the palpable sense of danger.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey from Aquitaine to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate hope for a cure to her ailing brother.  The vastness of the unknown land stretched before her, a tapestry woven with beauty and peril in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent hues a mesmerizing distraction from the perilous navigation required.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a legendary energy source rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of the galaxy, peppered with uncharted systems and potential alien encounters, presented challenges far removed from Elara’s earthly struggles, yet the thrill of discovery and the ever-present risk mirrored the medieval traveler's intrepid spirit.  The universe, like the medieval world, was a place of breathtaking wonder and terrifying unknown.
