
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust that swirled around them like vengeful spirits. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria’s rumored gold and the desperate hope for salvation fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of cosmic colors.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace held its own risk – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life. But the vastness of space, and the potential for discovery, held a potent allure that dwarfed the dangers.
