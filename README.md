
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged Duke of Normandy.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown hedgerows, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Yet, the thrill of the journey, the unknown unfolding with every sunrise, spurred her onward, a lone knight errant in a tapestry of emerald fields and brooding forests.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The crimson and sapphire hues painted the viewport in breathtaking strokes, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the engines.  Her mission: to establish contact with the elusive K'tharr civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate factions – but the same adventurous spirit burned within her, a legacy carried across the vast gulf of time and space.
