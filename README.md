
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside,  her worn leather satchel holding all her worldly possessions.  The whispers of war followed her like a shadow, but her quest for the legendary healer’s herb in the distant mountains burned brighter than any fear.  Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog, each sun-drenched valley held the potential for both peril and unexpected kindness, a constant dance between hope and hardship on her arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Nird before the Kryll Hegemony could.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading Kryll patrol ships, he felt the familiar thrill of the chase, the vast emptiness of space a stark contrast to the close-knit camaraderie of his crew.  The universe held infinite wonders, and equally infinite dangers – a testament to the ever-present risk and reward of interstellar exploration.
