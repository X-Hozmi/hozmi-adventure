
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide through treacherous mountain passes and lawless territories.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, starvation, or the insidious spread of the Black Death, yet the allure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, fuels her relentless journey.  The call of adventure, a siren's song woven into the very fabric of the medieval world, drowns out her fears.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the Kepler-186f system.  Her mission: to locate a rumored precursor civilization that mastered faster-than-light travel.  Navigation relies on intricate astrogation charts and the delicate dance of hyperspace jumps, each one a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. The vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy stretches before her, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of discovery, a future where the greatest adventures lie beyond the reach of any earthly horizon.
