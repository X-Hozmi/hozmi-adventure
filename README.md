
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning mud.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the plague that ravaged their land.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a testament to the human spirit's endurance in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the relentless wear and tear of interstellar travel tested the ship's resilience and her crew's courage.  Yet, the promise of finding life amidst the vast emptiness of space, the chance to make contact with a long-lost civilization, propelled them forward into the uncharted regions of the cosmos.
