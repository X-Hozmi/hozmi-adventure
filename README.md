
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, snaked towards the unknown.  His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, rumored to possess the power to heal the King's ailing son.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both peril and promise – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching winter all lay ahead, challenging his courage and testing the limits of his endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless scans of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond any medieval knight could comprehend – temporal anomalies, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of alien aggression. Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of charting unmapped galaxies, spurred them on across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
