
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s worn boots crunched on frozen earth.  Her small band of mercenaries, faces grim beneath hooded cloaks, trudged onward towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold unimaginable riches.  Each day was a gamble – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation dogged their heels.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the thrill of the unknown, pushed them further, a relentless compass guiding them across the unforgiving landscapes of a war-torn continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant light-years from known space.  The journey itself was an odyssey, navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the scientific breakthroughs promised by the mission, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, fueled her and her crew, driving them across the uncharted vastness of the galaxy.
