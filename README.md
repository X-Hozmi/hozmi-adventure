
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral to pray for the ailing King, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous bogs threatened to swallow their horses whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, they pushed further, their resolve fueled by faith and the promise of reaching their destination, even if it meant risking everything along the way.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate a legendary lost colony, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling cosmic anomalies, Eva and her crew faced challenges far beyond anything imaginable to medieval travelers.  But the lure of discovery, the hope of unlocking interstellar secrets, spurred them onward, defying the unimaginable distances and deadly hazards of the cosmos.
