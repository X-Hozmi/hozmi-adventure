
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the fractured kingdoms had been brutal; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the road had tested him to his limits.  But the whispers of a lost city, a city of gold said to lie beyond the Whispering Woods, fueled his weary bones.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and unimaginable riches.  The road ahead was long, but the lure of adventure, of glory, burned brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the rumored Xylan artifact, a technology capable of warping space-time itself.  The journey across the known galaxies had been fraught with danger; pirate raids, rogue gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown sentient species. Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the allure of the unknown fuelled her unyielding spirit.  The cosmos held untold secrets, and Eva, fearless at the helm of her vessel, was determined to unlock them.
