
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had become a desperate race against time and bandits.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers demanding perilous crossings, and the ever-present threat of lurking thieves preying on lone travelers. Their meager supplies dwindled, and the landscape, once awe-inspiring, now felt like a hostile, unforgiving entity. Yet, the glimmer of hope fueled their weary steps, a promise of sanctuary and solace at journey's end.

In the 27th century, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the planet Xylos, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with strange, alien lifeforms were commonplace hazards.  The weight of responsibility, the loneliness of space, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions tested the crew's resilience.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to unlock unimaginable technological advancements, spurred them onward in their perilous interstellar voyage.
