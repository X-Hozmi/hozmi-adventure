
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead, the Spine of the World mountains loomed, a jagged, snow-capped barrier between him and the fabled city of Eldoria.  His quest, to recover a stolen relic, had led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the chilling embrace of the high passes. Each day was a gamble against the elements, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of human treachery, but the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of untold riches, spurred him on.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant far beyond known charted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions that haunted the outer rim, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were just a taste of the dangers she faced.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the promise of scientific breakthroughs were a worthy reward for the risks involved in interstellar travel.
