
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of northern France, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen reliquary of St. Fiacre, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky blackness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on unsuspecting interstellar travelers.  But for Eva, the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risk; the universe was her canvas, and each new star system, a stroke of vibrant possibility.
