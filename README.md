The sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of parched earth and distant woodsmoke.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Mountains, legendary for their bandit lords and unpredictable weather, a necessary passage on his quest to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Alora.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of peril, but the thought of glory spurred him onwards, a glint of steel in his determined eyes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent colours, her course plotted across lightyears to the Kepler-186f system.

While space pirates and hostile alien lifeforms posed a threat far different from medieval bandits, the spirit of adventure remained the same; a relentless pursuit of the unknown, fueled by courage and a thirst for discovery amongst the breathtaking beauty and unforgiving vastness of the cosmos.
