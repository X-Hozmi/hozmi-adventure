
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snakes across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, the unpredictable moods of the desert, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheels and every shared fire under the vast night sky, the adventure deepens.  The whispered tales around the campfire, the vibrant colours of a distant city glimpsed on the horizon, the shared struggle against hardship – these forge bonds stronger than any castle wall.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter', a nimble freighter navigating the treacherous Kepler-186f system.  Her cargo: exotic minerals mined from asteroid fields, and the ever-present thrill of the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the swirling chaos of nebulae and the potential ambush of pirate raiders.  But the reward is the vastness of space itself, the discovery of new worlds, and the camaraderie forged under the cold, indifferent gaze of distant suns.
