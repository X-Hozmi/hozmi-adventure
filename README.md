
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – negotiating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and navigating through dense, unfamiliar forests teeming with wild beasts. Their only companions were their unwavering faith and the shared hope of reaching their destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace; the real challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of exploration, remained a constant, a unifying thread between eras.
