
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary horse onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, mirroring the turmoil in his own heart.  His quest: to find the lost city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the legends that promised – and perhaps threatened – him untold power. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a renewed resolve to push further into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent, breathtaking beauty of the cosmic expanse.  Her mission: to locate a colony ship lost in the Andromeda Galaxy, a vessel carrying the last seeds of a dying civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and wrestling with malfunctioning equipment were everyday hazards. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of terror – the soul-crushing loneliness of being truly alone, light-years from anything resembling home.
