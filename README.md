
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she bumped across the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn tunic.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient forests, and the relentless sun beat down mercilessly.  Yet, with each creak of her cart wheels, Elara’s determination grew stronger, fueled by the tales of untold riches and the promise of a life beyond the drudgery of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its multi-hued gases a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of a thousand glittering stars. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the nebula decades ago.  The journey was long, the dangers unimaginable – cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Rexx, a seasoned explorer with a heart as vast as the cosmos itself, pressed on, driven by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the secrets of the lost colony.
