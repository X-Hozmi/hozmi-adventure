
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but the seed of a new life – a rare herb rumored to cure the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the very disease she sought to vanquish.  This journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was her only hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the reclusive Kryll civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raids was a daily challenge.  But the weight of galactic stability rested on her shoulders, a far cry from the simple hope carried by Elara's journey, yet equally profound in its potential impact.
