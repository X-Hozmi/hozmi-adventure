
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to her homespun tunic.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Yet, with each sunrise, a fresh wave of determination pushed her onward, the promise of the sacred shrine a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.  She carried not gold, but the weight of a broken heart and a fervent prayer.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been perilous, pushing the vessel to its limits. Now, the crew faced a different challenge: a derelict alien vessel, emitting a distress signal that hinted at a treasure beyond imagination, or a deadly trap.  Ryla, however, knew only one course: forward, into the unknown, her crew's trust and the lure of the galaxy's secrets her only compass in this vast, breathtaking emptiness.
