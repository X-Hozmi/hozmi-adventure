
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack-horse laden with meager supplies, trudged through the muddied track.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral to atone for a reckless youth, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Days blurred into a monotonous cycle of aching muscles, meager rations, and the constant threat of bandits and the harsh elements. Yet, beneath the hardship, a thrill pulsed; the unpredictable nature of the road, the fleeting glimpses of unfamiliar landscapes, and the stories shared around crackling fires with weary travelers—these were the spices of adventure, far richer than any imagined glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The vastness of space, a stark contrast to medieval treks, held a different kind of peril.  Unpredictable gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships demanded constant vigilance and quick thinking.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, the thrill of discovering uncharted planets, and the camaraderie forged amongst her crew in the face of cosmic danger fueled her daring journey—a quest mirroring the timeless human desire to explore the unknown.
