
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, a knight newly-returned from the Crusades, found himself not yearning for the quiet life of his manor, but for the untamed thrill of the road.  His destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden deep within the Sahara.  With only a worn map, a loyal squire, and a pack mule burdened with supplies, he set out, facing scorching deserts, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a memory etched in the tapestry of his adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Facing gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration. The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held countless wonders, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
