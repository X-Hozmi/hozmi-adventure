
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, stained with rain and sweat, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and deadly peril – a journey demanding courage, cunning, and a healthy dose of luck to navigate the unpredictable terrain, bandits, and the ever-present threat of famine. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or doom.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* pierced the inky black between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as they navigated the treacherous nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, a cosmic graveyard littered with derelict vessels and unpredictable gravitational currents. Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos star system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of their insignificance, yet their resolve to push the boundaries of human exploration burned brighter than any star.
