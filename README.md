
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the biting wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a dense forest, promising both adventure and peril.  Each bend held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of a monstrous creature said to haunt these woods fueled his companions' fears, yet also spurred their courage.  The quest to reach the distant monastery, rumored to hold a relic of immense power, was a dangerous gamble, but the glory and potential rewards outweighed the risks.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harboring sentient life.  The journey across the galaxy, fraught with the perils of asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, was a far cry from the muddy tracks of Kaelan's era. Yet the spirit of adventure remained the same, a burning ember driving her and her crew to push the boundaries of the known universe, despite the immense risk of encountering unknown and potentially hostile forces in the vast, uncharted reaches of space.
