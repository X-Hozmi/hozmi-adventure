
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, lumbered across the desolate plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Whispers of monstrous beasts and treacherous bandits followed them like shadows, adding spice to the already perilous journey. Every sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating shifting sands, bartering for scarce water, or fending off the inevitable skirmishes with rival caravans.  The promise of silks, spices, and untold riches fuelled their onward march, even as the relentless sun beat down, testing their courage and resilience.

A thousand years hence, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in light years, each jump a gamble between successful hyperspace transit and catastrophic warp core failure.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced not only the hazards of space – asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but also the psychological strain of prolonged isolation amidst the cold, indifferent vastness of the cosmos.  The pursuit of knowledge, and the yearning for the unknown, were their only compass.
