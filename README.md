
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she trudges across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine. Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and a worn map, is her only companion on this desperate journey to find her brother, lost amongst the warring factions.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of unknown dangers lurking in the shadowed forests and crumbling castles that dot her path.  Her spirit, however, remains unbroken, fueled by a sister's unwavering love and the whispered promise of adventure that calls her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius navigates the iridescent nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to deliver vital cryo-preserved samples across the Andromeda galaxy to a research station on the far side of the known universe.  His journey is fraught with the perils of black holes, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Yet, amidst the cosmic wonders and perilous navigation, the thrill of discovery and the boundless expanse of the galaxy ignite a fire in his soul, making this interstellar voyage a far cry from the mundane routines of his former life.
