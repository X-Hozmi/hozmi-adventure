
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, had thrust her onto this perilous journey.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the lonely nights. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay between her and her destination – a desperate race against time and the ever-present threat of the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, had been treacherous, a dice roll against gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the galaxy was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to the immensity of the universe and the fragility of human life far from home.  The success of her mission – the search for a new colony – rested on her shoulders, a burden heavier than any physical weight.
