
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bit at Elara's face as she urged her weary horse onward, the rutted track disappearing into the vast, whispering forests of Bavaria.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the Emperor, a message that could prevent a devastating war.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes threatened to break both horse and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the fire in her belly burned brighter than any fear, fueled by a duty to her people and the whispered promise of adventure beyond her wildest dreams.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of bridging the vast distances between galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals tested her skills and courage to their limits.  The cosmos held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, but Nova pressed on, driven by the thrill of discovery and the hope of bringing a lost people home.
