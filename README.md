
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Elara from the clutches of the Black Baron, a journey fraught with peril that promised treacherous passes, skirmishes with brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of the unknown, the exhilarating and terrifying uncertainty that was the life of a medieval adventurer.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts flickered across her console, displaying the treacherous asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies they'd yet to encounter.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant sparkle of suns and the hum of her ship’s engines, held a different kind of peril: the unknown expanse of the cosmos, the potential for alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failures light-years from any rescue. Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to chart new worlds, fueled her journey through the inky black.
