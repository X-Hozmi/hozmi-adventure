
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling market square I'd left behind weeks ago.  My quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets lost to time.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the uncharted reaches of the known world. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the promise of a hard-earned rest under a canvas sky.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion.  Instead of horses and carts, I navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy aboard a starship.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike anything encountered before.  While the dangers were different – hostile alien encounters, navigational hazards in unmapped space, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction – the thrill of the unknown remained.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vastness and unpredictability of the cosmos.
