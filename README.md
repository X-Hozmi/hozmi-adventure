
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the endless plains of Aquitaine stretching before her like a sun-baked sea.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and meager supplies, felt like a lead weight against her aching back.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, fueled her journey, a perilous path fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a gnawing uncertainty, but the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of the unknown, kept her relentlessly moving forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage that would test the limits of human endurance and technology.  The dangers were less tangible than Elara's – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms – but no less perilous.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held a similar siren call to the medieval adventurer's quest for the unknown.
