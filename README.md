
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, guided his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey's end.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, his resolve hardened, fueled by the love for his kin and the allure of the unknown lands stretching before him.  The wind carried the scent of distant spices and the echo of forgotten histories, urging him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across light-years of unforgiving space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her courage and skill to the limits.  But the possibility of discovering new life and forging a path through the uncharted cosmos – that potent mix of danger and discovery – was a siren's call she couldn’t resist.
