
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages, and enduring the relentless ache in their bones from days spent on horseback. Their adventure was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a sacred goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of nebulae was child's play compared to the political intrigue and corporate espionage that threatened her mission.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  But Eva, hardened by years of exploration, held steadfast, driven by the allure of discovery and the promise of rewriting the history of interstellar travel.
