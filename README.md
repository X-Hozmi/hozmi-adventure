
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy ochre curtain against the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey wasn't measured in days, but in months of navigating asteroid fields, warping through spacetime, and battling the occasional space pirate.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her crew, but the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and encountering new life, spurred them onward, a modern echo of the medieval knight's quest for a distant salvation.
