
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor comfort against the gnawing fear in her gut.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of K'tharr, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were daily companions on her perilous journey, a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a fragile hope of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out the viewport of the 'Stardust Drifter,' the swirling nebulae of Xylos a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage.  Their mission: to secure a vital mineral resource from the remote planet of Aethel, crucial to sustaining life on New Terra.  Navigation through asteroid fields, skirmishes with space pirates, and the constant threat of engine failure were the hazards of interstellar travel, a far cry from Elara's medieval struggles but equally fraught with danger. The vastness of space held both wonder and peril in equal measure.
