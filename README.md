
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving Pyrenees mountains.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery, bandits and breathtaking vistas, a testament to the harsh beauty and unpredictable dangers of medieval overland travel.  Survival meant relying on her wits, her meagre supplies, and the kindness – or indifference – of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in Earth time.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held its own terrifying uncertainties – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  Advanced technology provided a shield against some dangers, but Eva knew that human ingenuity and courage were still the most vital components in her galactic voyage, a testament to humankind's enduring desire to explore the unknown, even across the unimaginable gulf between stars.
