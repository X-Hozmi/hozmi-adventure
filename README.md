
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the far more terrifying uncertainties of an unknown land.  He carried only a worn map, a handful of dried figs, and an unwavering belief in the legend, a potent fuel against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars was child's play compared to the existential dread of interstellar travel.  The vast, unforgiving emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of galaxies, presented a different kind of peril than Thomas faced, a lonely battle against the odds that only the steeliest resolve could withstand.
