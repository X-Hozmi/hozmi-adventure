
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier on his journey to the mythical city of Eldoria. Rumours whispered of untold riches and powerful magic, a siren song that spurred him onward despite the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the looming shadow of the Black Death. Each creak of the saddle, each splash of mud, was a step closer to his destiny, or his doom.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. The journey, fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation and unpredictable wormholes, was a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of new worlds.  With a crew of hardened explorers beside her, Eva faced the vast unknown, driven by the hope of discovering a new home among the stars and the thrill of charting unmapped territories across the galaxy.
