
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the gnawing anxiety of his quest – to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of St.  Albans, a relic said to hold the key to ending the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the flickering light of his torch.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as the stars streaked past in a dizzying ballet.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her resolve, a driving force as powerful as any medieval knight's quest for glory.
