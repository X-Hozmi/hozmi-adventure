
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on her face.  Her journey across the unforgiving plains of Castile was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered promise of a legendary lost city, filled with forgotten knowledge and untold riches, spurred her onward, each hardship a testament to her unwavering resolve.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and grime, was her only guide in this vast and dangerous world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a jewel-like cluster of potentially habitable planets light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, also held terrifying unknowns – volatile asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the universe, outweighed the danger.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reminder of humanity's relentless push into the unknown.
