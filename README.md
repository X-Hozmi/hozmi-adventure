
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's mule plodded across the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a chipped map, her only companions the relentless sun and the whispering wind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward.  This was a journey not of comfort, but of sheer survival, a test of both body and spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars, painted a breathtaking backdrop to her mission:  the retrieval of the elusive Xylossian crystals, vital for faster-than-light travel.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's medieval trek, Eva faced perils of her own – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, pirate attacks in the void, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any habitable world.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely and unforgiving frontier, demanding skill, courage, and unwavering resolve.
