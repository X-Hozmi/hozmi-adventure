
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed several of their number to fever and banditry.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Yet, the promise of Eldoria's fabled healing spring, and the thrill of the unknown, kept their weary spirits aloft.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to human endurance in a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted galaxy of Andromeda.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, her challenges weren't bandits or wild animals, but warp storms, rogue asteroids, and the vast, lonely emptiness of space.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the solar system, faced the unknown with the same courage as their medieval predecessors, their technology replacing brute strength with ingenuity and precision. Yet the spirit of adventure – the irresistible pull of the unexplored – burned just as brightly in their hearts, fueling their quest for knowledge and discovery among the stars.
