
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Brigid, had taken them through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and through sun-baked deserts.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages, and constantly vigilant against the ever-present threat of violence. Their adventure was a test of endurance, faith, and the bond between man and beast.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of a dying star were just some of the hazards she faced.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a challenge far exceeding any earthly terrain, testing not only her skills as a pilot but also her courage and resilience in the face of the unknown.
