
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing the perilous route to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the whispers of Zerzura's untold riches and lost knowledge fueled his weary steps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to conquer the unforgiving landscape and reach his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula of iridescent dust, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the ship's controls. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment failure.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration drove her, a lone star charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
