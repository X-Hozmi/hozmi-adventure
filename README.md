
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, a young cartographer's apprentice, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets lost to time.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of unimaginable riches and ancient knowledge, spurred him onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a jewel teeming with alien flora and fauna as dangerous as it was beautiful.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of rival corporations, Eva relied on her wits, her crew's skill, and the cutting-edge technology of her starship to reach her destination,  a daring journey across the unimaginable vastness of space.
