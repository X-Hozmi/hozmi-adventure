His quest, to reach the legendary Sunstone rumored to lie hidden in the Saracen lands, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease have tested his resilience.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the whispered promise of the Sunstone's power, spurs him onward, each sunrise a fresh invitation to face the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol system and the distant Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging the opportunistic raids of space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of solar flares demands both skill and unwavering courage.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, charting unmapped galaxies, and forging new alliances outweighs the considerable risks, each hyperspace jump a leap into the breathtaking vastness of the cosmos.
