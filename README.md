
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies from the caravan trailing behind him.  Their journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, a whispered legend among merchants, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, the desert threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked them like a phantom. Yet, the promise of silks, spices, and untold riches spurred them onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white.  The shimmering nebula outside the viewport pulsed with vibrant colours, a cosmic canvas far beyond anything the medieval travelers could have imagined. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light years.  The risks were different – catastrophic engine failures, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to unravel the mysteries of the universe, was a force as powerful as any medieval quest for gold and glory.
