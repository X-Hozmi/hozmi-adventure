
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, scorching deserts devoid of water, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of salvation, along with the camaraderie forged in hardship, fueled their perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.

Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate and retrieve the lost colony ship *Hope*, adrift somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, Ryla and her crew faced perils unimaginable to their medieval counterparts. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, and the boundless expanse of the cosmos itself, propelled them ever forward in their daring intergalactic voyage.
