
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it carries the weight of her family's hopes, a desperate plea for sanctuary tucked amongst dried herbs and a chipped wooden rosary.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her arduous journey east, a perilous trek towards a rumored haven beyond the borders of a war-torn kingdom. Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the unwavering glint in her eyes speaks of a fierce determination that fuels her onward.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a swirling nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation systems. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach.  The vast emptiness of space, broken only by the glittering tapestry of distant stars, holds both terrifying wonder and the promise of discovery.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but Nova, guided by her scientific curiosity and an indomitable spirit, presses on, a lone explorer pushing the boundaries of human knowledge across the cosmic ocean.
