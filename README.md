
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains, her meager possessions strapped to her saddle.  Each creak of her worn leather boots echoed the gnawing uncertainty in her heart.  She was fleeing a forced marriage, seeking a rumored sanctuary across the sea, a journey fraught with peril – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease lurking in every shadowed valley.  The vast, untamed landscape was both her prison and her escape, testing her strength and resolve with every grueling mile.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the journey to the Andromeda Galaxy was far from effortless.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks kept her crew on edge.  The allure of the unexplored, the promise of new civilizations and invaluable resources, fueled their daring expedition, a quest for knowledge and fortune among the uncharted stars.
