
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the English countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him further into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate attacks, and battling the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of fear, a profound loneliness that only the unwavering camaraderie of her crew could overcome.
