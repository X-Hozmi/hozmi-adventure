
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, forging a bond between the knight and his squire stronger than any castle wall. The vast, unknown landscape held both peril and promise, a tapestry woven with the threads of survival and hope.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the ancient Proxima Centauri research outpost before the K'tharr Confederacy could claim it.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling crippling solar flares were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacefarer. The breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, however, never ceased to awe her – a stark contrast to the dangerous realities of interstellar travel, where the boundaries between exploration and survival were constantly blurred.  The galaxy was their canvas, and every jump to hyperspace a brushstroke towards their unknown destiny.
