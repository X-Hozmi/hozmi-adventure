
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless miles traversed.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and forgotten magic. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a gamble against the odds.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and aggressive K'tharr warships.  The stars themselves seemed to conspire against her, testing her navigational skills and the sturdiness of her ship against the crushing pressures of interstellar space.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fuelled her daring expedition across the cosmic ocean.
