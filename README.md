
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the wind whipping her cloak around her.  Ahead lay the sprawling, unforgiving landscape of the Duchy of Aquitaine, a tapestry of sun-baked fields and dark, foreboding forests.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable whims of nature all stood between her and her goal.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors beyond the known galaxy, seeking new habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space held both wonder and unimaginable dangers – rogue asteroids, collapsing stars, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, every new planet a breathtaking, terrifying gamble with the unknown.
