
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains of France, his squire, Thomas, struggling to keep pace.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's healing powers spurred them onward, a beacon in the oppressive darkness of their time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the far reaches of the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading hostile K'tharr raiders, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering determination.  The vastness of space held unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, a constant test of courage and ingenuity in their desperate search for a lost civilization.
