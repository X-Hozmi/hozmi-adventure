
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of parched earth and woodsmoke from distant villages.  His quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Jude – had led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-infested forests, and across rivers swollen with spring melt. Each day brought new challenges, from skirmishes with bandits to navigating the shifting sands of the desolate plains, but the promise of glory and the unwavering faith in his cause fueled his determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, dodging pirate vessels and battling solar flares, was all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva's crew, a band of seasoned explorers, faced each challenge with courage and ingenuity, bound together by their shared dream of discovery and the hope of finding a lost civilization amongst the stars.
