
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had tested her resilience beyond measure.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the whispers of Eldoria’s magic, fueled her onward, a tiny speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a blur of hyperspace jumps and navigational calculations, was a far cry from Elara’s arduous trek.  Yet, the challenges were no less daunting – unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation, and the lonely vastness of space itself.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, spurred Ryla onward, a solitary explorer charting a course into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
