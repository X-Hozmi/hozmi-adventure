Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the secrets of ancient healing.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in her pursuit of knowledge, a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than any hearth fire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrilling uncertainty of her quest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure funding and navigate the complex alliances between interstellar corporations.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful expanse of black punctuated by the glittering promise of new worlds, offered a different kind of adventure, one fueled by ambition and the unyielding human desire to explore the unknown.
