
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his resilience, and a renewed hope fueled by the shimmering mirage of Zerzura on the horizon – a promise of adventure, however perilous.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across a system of uncharted planets after a catastrophic solar flare.  Facing cosmic storms, pirate attacks from the Kryll syndicate, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in unmapped space, Elara navigated the treacherous expanse. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith propelled by the hope of finding the colonists and the thrill of discovering new worlds.
