
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she spurred her horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the wrath of a vengeful sorcerer.  Survival, she knew, depended not only on her skill with a blade but also on the kindness of strangers and the resilience of her spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable currents of spacetime, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Ryla's mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the limits of her technology and her courage, a journey far more perilous than any medieval quest, yet fueled by a similar spirit of daring and hope.
