
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of the Sunstone, and the hope it offered, fueled his relentless journey across the land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades prior.  Warp jumps tossed her ship through the fabric of spacetime, while alien anomalies and pirate raids threatened her crew.  The vast expanse of the galaxy, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the limits of her courage and her ship's resilience, but the promise of finding the lost colonists spurred her onward.
