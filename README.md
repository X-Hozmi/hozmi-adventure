
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown. Each sunrise brought new challenges – a ford to cross, a village to barter with, a hidden path to navigate – each a thrilling step closer to his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, the ship shuddered against gravitational tides, and alien landscapes flashed past the viewport – a kaleidoscope of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns.  The vast expanse of space held its own perils: rogue asteroids, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure. Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting the uncharted, pushed her and her crew ever onward across the cosmic sea.
