
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, the creak of her saddle a constant companion.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Aethelred, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threaten to swallow her whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation hangs heavy in the air.  But the whispered promise of healing, of salvation for her ailing brother, fuels her onward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to overcome the hardships of this medieval odyssey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of space remains a daunting frontier.  Cosmic storms threaten to tear her ship apart, unknown alien lifeforms lurk in the shadowed reaches, and the loneliness of interstellar travel weighs heavily on her crew.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to uncover the secrets of the universe, pushes them ever forward, each jump to hyperspace a thrilling leap into the unknown.
