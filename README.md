
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadows of the Pyrenees Mountains barely registered against the thrill of her quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the lost Gospels of Saint Jude.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, was a potential hazard, but the promise of discovery fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the nebula NGC 7000, the North American Nebula.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare element crucial to interstellar travel, hidden on a remote planet orbiting a binary star system.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of rival corporations were mere inconveniences compared to the grandeur of traversing the cosmos, the breathtaking spectacle of nebulas and distant galaxies a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities – and perils – that lay beyond humanity's reach.
