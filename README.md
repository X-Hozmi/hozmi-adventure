The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – jagged peaks clawed at the bruised sky, while hidden valleys promised both bounty and peril.  Each day brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, and bartering for supplies in isolated villages where rumour and suspicion ran thicker than ale.

The galaxy was a canvas of infinite possibilities, but every star held its own unique and dangerous story.
