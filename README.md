
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate moor, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of medieval life left behind in York.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to a potent magic.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, encounters with hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His only companions were his trusty sword, a meager supply of dried meat, and the unwavering hope that fuelled his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was a daily routine, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration.  The success of her mission rested not only on advanced technology, but on her courage and unwavering resolve in the face of the unknown.
