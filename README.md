His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey across the vast and unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe, a tapestry woven with peril and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.

The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its indifference, provided a constant backdrop to her intergalactic adventure, a thrilling race against time and a relentless pursuit of a distant, potentially life-altering prize.
