
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to recover the stolen relic of Saint Elmo, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of the Whispering Woods, where bandits and worse lurked in the gloom. Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with rival knights, bartering with suspicious villagers, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the Saint's silver chalice, a shimmering promise in his mind, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a newly discovered planet, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the ever-present threat of radiation storms, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also terrifying dangers – a constant reminder of the fragility of life far from the cradle of humanity.
