
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains, then the sun-baked plains of Castile, each step a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease. Our mule train, laden with silks and spices destined for the court of the King of Aragon, was our only sanctuary, a slow-moving island in a sea of uncertainty. The whispered tales of Moorish castles and forgotten Roman roads fueled our weary spirits as we pressed onward, driven by the allure of adventure and the promise of untold riches.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting drone.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating the asteroid fields was a tense dance with fate, each near-miss a reminder of the unforgiving vastness of space.  The crew, a motley assortment of scientists and explorers, relied on each other's expertise and courage as we faced unforeseen cosmic storms and the eerie silence of deep space.  The discovery of a new civilization, or perhaps just a breathtaking alien landscape, awaited us on the other side of the wormhole.
