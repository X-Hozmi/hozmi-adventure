
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the packhorse behind.  Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden lands to the distant city of Avignon was fraught with peril; each shadowed forest, each cresting hill, held the potential for ambush.  The clatter of hooves and the rhythmic creak of saddle leather were a constant reminder of the precariousness of their situation, their survival a testament to both skill and luck.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, *The Wanderer*,  navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The shimmering cosmic dust, breathtaking in its beauty, hid countless dangers: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Sir Gareth, Eva possessed advanced technology – hyperdrive, shields, and sophisticated sensors – but the vast emptiness of space presented a different kind of peril; loneliness and the crushing weight of unimaginable distances were as formidable opponents as any land-based foe.
