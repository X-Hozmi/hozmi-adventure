
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I journeyed across the snow-covered Alps.  Each creak of my pack mule was a reminder of the precious silks and spices I carried, a fortune that could secure my family’s future, or become the price of my life amongst bandits and unforgiving terrain.  The towering peaks were a constant threat, and the whispered tales of monstrous creatures lurking in the valleys fueled my anxieties, yet the promise of distant markets spurred me onwards.  The adventure was perilous, but the potential reward far outweighed the risks.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the cabin as we leaped across the vast gulf between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next giant leap.  The journey, a blur of starlight and calculated risks, was far removed from the hardships of medieval travel, yet the thrill remained.  The unknown stretched before us, a tapestry woven with the possibility of discovery and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.  The adventure was different, but the human spirit's thirst for the unknown remained unchanged.
