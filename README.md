
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's pardon, a forged letter of introduction, and a desperate hope nestled amongst his meager belongings. His journey from the shadowed forests of Bavaria to the sun-drenched shores of the Mediterranean promised riches beyond imagining – or a swift and brutal death at the hands of bandits, warring factions, or the ever-present plague. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: treacherous mountain passes, feuding lords, and the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead.  This was adventure, raw and unforgiving.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across uncharted star systems and through gravitational anomalies that threatened to crush her vessel.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.  This was adventure on a galactic scale, fueled by courage, technology, and an unyielding thirst for discovery.
