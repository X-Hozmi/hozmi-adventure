The rough track wound through a seemingly endless forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  He carried with him King Alaric's decree, a mission to forge an alliance with the distant Duke of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.

The journey was a gamble, a desperate race against time and the uncaring indifference of the cosmos.
