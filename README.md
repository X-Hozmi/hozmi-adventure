
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the looming threat of bandits and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a stark contrast to the quiet determination etched on her face.  This journey to Avignon, to deliver a vital message to the Pope, was a test of her endurance, her courage, and her unwavering loyalty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous voyage.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll raiders, Ryla's crew faced challenges far beyond the scope of any medieval traveler.  Yet, the promise of a unified galaxy fueled their unwavering spirit, each warp jump a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of space.
