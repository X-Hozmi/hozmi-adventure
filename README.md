
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onwards.  The biting wind whipped across the bleak, rain-lashed moor, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards promised in his destination, the fabled city of Avignon.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort from his weary mount, marked the passage of another league, another step closer to both fortune and peril, for the roads were riddled with bandits and the whispers of war echoed on the wind.  The journey promised riches, but demanded courage and resilience in equal measure.


Conversely, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos cluster aboard the 'Stardust Drifter'. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the crackling static of long-range comms. Unlike the medieval knight, Eva faced the silent dangers of hyperspace –  uncharted asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting a new frontier for humanity, spurred her onwards across the unimaginable distances of space.
