
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, fragile seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of both peril and hope.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but small obstacles in her determined quest. Her journey, a perilous thread woven through the tapestry of medieval life, would determine the fate of many.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian crystal, a source of unimaginable energy said to power interstellar travel beyond the known galaxy.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Pirate raids, malfunctioning hyperdrives, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien species were merely hazards on her chart.  This voyage, a daring leap into the unknown across the cosmic ocean, represented humanity's next giant step into the future.
