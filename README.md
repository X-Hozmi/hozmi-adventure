
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each nightfall a precarious hope for survival, yet the allure of the sacred city, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred her relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry.  Warp drives hummed, carrying her across unimaginable distances, towards the fabled Kepler-186f.  While dangers were different – asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace – the spirit of adventure remained the same. The unknown stretched before her, a galaxy of possibilities and perils, beckoning her ever onward.
