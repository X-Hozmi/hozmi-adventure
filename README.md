
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than her grandfather.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Dragon's Tooth mountains were less intimidating than the rumors of the lost city of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, fueled her desperate hope and relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as they leaped across unimaginable distances, the swirling nebulae outside a breathtaking but terrifying reminder of the vast emptiness of space. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a secret coveted by empires across the known universe.  The risks were immense - hostile alien life, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted void. But the promise of discovery burned brighter than any fear.
