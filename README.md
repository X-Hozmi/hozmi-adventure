
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Castile, a cruel mockery of the shimmering oasis promised by his guide.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll, their meager supplies dwindling faster than the dwindling hope of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his weary horse, echoed the uncertain path ahead, a path fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking panorama of celestial bodies outside.  Though the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the potential for warp-core failure – the spirit of adventure remained the same. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, mirrored the unforgiving landscapes of old, but the goal, much like Sir Reginald's, was fuelled by a powerful, unwavering hope for a better future.
