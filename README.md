
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest – to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness – was a perilous one.  Bandit-infested passes, treacherous mountain trails, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in a minstrel's song.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, and a deepening sense of the vast, unpredictable world stretching before her.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to overcome the cosmic expanse.  The vastness of space, unlike the medieval world, offered a chilling isolation punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena unseen by any earthly eye.
