
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a desperately needed shipment of medicinal herbs for a plague-stricken village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or the disease itself.  Yet, the hope in her heart, and the knowledge that her journey could save lives, fuels her onward, pushing her through the treacherous mountain passes and across the sun-baked plains.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the notoriously unstable K'tharr system.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate patrols is second nature, but the political intrigue and potential for betrayal from within his own crew are a far greater threat.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, is a lonely and unforgiving expanse, demanding courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck to survive.
