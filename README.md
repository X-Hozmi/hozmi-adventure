
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary oxen onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, and yet, with every league traversed, the thrill of discovery fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the holy city a beacon in the gathering gloom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the distant Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a gamble against the odds and the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroid fields, but the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, spurred her crew onward, a shared dream painting a brighter future among the stars.
