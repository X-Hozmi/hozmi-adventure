
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than the lure of the fabled City of Gold, rumored to lie hidden somewhere beyond the mountains.  Each creaking step of her weary beast was a gamble, a testament to her unwavering resolve in a world where survival was a daily struggle and the greatest adventure lay in simply reaching the next sunrise.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  His mission: to retrieve the ancient artifact, the Heart of Xylos, from a long-abandoned mining colony on a planet teetering on the brink of collapse.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the potential threat of alien scavengers were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of galactic exploration and the chance to unearth a relic capable of rewriting history.
