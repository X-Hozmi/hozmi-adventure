
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s small band crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Anatolian plateau stretching before them like a rumpled, ochre carpet. Their journey to Constantinople, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease, was far from over. Each day brought new challenges: navigating the winding paths through rocky canyons, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and facing the constant gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead. The allure of the Byzantine capital, however, fueled their weary steps, a beacon of riches and adventure promising to outweigh the hardships of their arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport pulsed with a thousand colours, a breathtaking vista only glimpsed by a handful of humanity. Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds amidst the cosmic dust and swirling gas giants.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life – but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of exploration in the face of the unknown, remained the same powerful force driving her onward across the vast, star-strewn canvas of space.
