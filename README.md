
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her meager supplies – dried meats, a waterskin, and a worn map – were all that stood between her and the unknown.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, spurred her onward, despite the looming threat of bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present fear of the wild.  Each creaking step of her faithful mule was a gamble, a step closer to adventure or oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational pulls and unforeseen celestial phenomena, the vast expanse of space both beautiful and terrifying.  Their mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere, a relic of a long-lost civilization, hidden amidst the star cluster.  The risks were astronomical – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – but the potential reward, unlocking the secrets of a forgotten age, outweighed the peril.
