
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zaragoza before winter's grip tightened.  Each day was a struggle against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger, but the whispered legends of Zaragoza's lost libraries fueled her relentless journey, a promise of knowledge worth more than gold.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, a planet shrouded in mystery and promising both unimaginable riches and perilous unknowns.  The journey across galaxies was a dance with gravity wells and radiation storms, a test of courage and technological prowess, but the possibility of finding a new Eden justified the risks a thousand times over.
