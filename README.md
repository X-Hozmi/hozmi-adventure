
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous rivers snaked their way across the path, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavier than the midday sun.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant test of her courage and resilience.  But the allure of Zerzura, a city said to hold the secrets of immortality, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f system, light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling the unpredictable currents of hyperspace were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of the cosmos instilled both awe and a profound sense of isolation.  Her mission, to locate a lost colony ship, was fraught with technological challenges and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life forms.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the promise of charting new territories in the uncharted reaches of space, fueled her unwavering determination.
