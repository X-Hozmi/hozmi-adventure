
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each winding path held the promise of both breathtaking vistas and unseen dangers – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The weight of her brother's life, and the vast, unforgiving landscape, pressed down on her with equal force.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of its celestial river a stark contrast to the cool blue glow of her ship's navigation console. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the occasional ominous whisper of a black hole, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys.  Yet, the weight of responsibility – the potential to save countless lives – felt no less immense.
