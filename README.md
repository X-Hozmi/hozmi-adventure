
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track through the Black Forest, offered no respite from the biting wind.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the creeping dread of the unknown, making every league a perilous gamble against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her home world.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel were all commonplace hazards.  The vast, empty gulf of space, beautiful yet terrifying, presented a different kind of challenge than the medieval forests, but the thrill of exploration and the weight of responsibility remained the same.
