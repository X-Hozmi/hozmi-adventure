
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as his weary steed picked its way across the parched Provençal landscape.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, had led him far from the familiar comforts of his manor. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague-ridden villages chilled him more than the biting wind. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every hardship overcome, the thrill of the unknown fueled his determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp drives hummed, jumping them across light-years in the blink of an eye, but the vastness of space held its own perilous charm. Rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded constant vigilance. Each jump was a gamble, but the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories in the cosmos, outweighed the risks.
