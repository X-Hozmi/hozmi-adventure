
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone monastery nestled high in the Alpenglow mountains, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous river crossing, was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of hope, fueled by her unwavering devotion, spurred her onward through sun-drenched valleys and snow-choked passes, a tiny figure against the immensity of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts were unreliable, alien threats lurked in the void between stars, and the ship’s aging hyperdrive strained under the immense distance.  But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, held fast to her course, guided by the faint, persistent signal echoing from a forgotten world—a beacon of hope in the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
