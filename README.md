
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey to the Holy Land was arduous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains presented treacherous crossings, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled his steps. He carried not just a pilgrim's staff, but the hopes and prayers of his entire village, a silent pact forged in shared hardship and unwavering faith.  The destination, Jerusalem, felt as distant as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of incandescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey wasn't plagued by bandits or disease, but by the unforgiving vastness of space – unpredictable solar flares, the constant threat of micrometeoroid impacts, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for finding new life, propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course into the unknown.
