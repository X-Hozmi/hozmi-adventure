
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meat and herbs, holds more than sustenance; it holds the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura, a whispered legend promising untold riches and a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature are constant companions on her perilous journey, testing her courage and resilience with every step.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', leaping across galaxies in pursuit of the Xylos artifact, a legendary device capable of manipulating spacetime.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels is commonplace; the vastness of space itself presents the greatest challenge.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where the promise of unimaginable power clashes with the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies and the insidious tendrils of alien empires vying for the same prize.
