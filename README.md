
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the lost chronicle of King Arthur.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the plague that stalked the land.  Every mile was a gamble, a test of endurance and will against the unforgiving terrain and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian artifact, a key to faster-than-light travel rumored to be hidden on a remote, uncharted planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, Eva relied on her wits and the ship's advanced technology, facing the cosmic unknown with courage and a steely determination.  The galaxy was vast, but the thrill of discovery fueled her journey across the inky black.
