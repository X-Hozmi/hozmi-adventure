
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions on this perilous journey across the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with a different kind of anticipation.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space. But the lure of the fabled Xylos Cluster, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, spurred her on, a beacon in the infinite darkness.  The universe was her steppe, and the stars her guide.
