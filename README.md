
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming dully beneath the overcast sky, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years across the vast expanse of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the psychological strain of prolonged isolation were all part of the routine.  But for Eva, the vastness of space held an allure far greater than any earthly kingdom; the cosmos, a boundless canvas of adventure, beckoned with its myriad mysteries and unimaginable wonders.
