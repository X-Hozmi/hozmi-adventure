
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I trudged through the snow-covered Ardennes forest.  Each step was a gamble – a misplaced foot could mean a broken bone, a twisted ankle, or worse, a deadly encounter with a wolf pack.  My meager supplies – dried meat, a waterskin half-full, and a battered map – were all that stood between me and the harsh realities of medieval travel.  The distant glint of a castle spire offered a sliver of hope, a potential refuge from the biting wind and the looming darkness.  Yet the path ahead remained treacherous, a tapestry woven with uncertainty and the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion, a low thrum that vibrated through my bones.  Instead of forests, nebulae painted the viewport in swirling colours.  Instead of wolves, the void held unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirates.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey itself was the adventure; the challenges of interstellar navigation, the alien landscapes we might discover, and the potential for first contact with another sentient species were both exhilarating and terrifying prospects.  Every jump through hyperspace was a leap into the great unknown.
