
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through a seemingly endless forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each bend in the path held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the rumors of a dragon guarding a lost city spurred him ever closer, his heart a drum against his ribs.  He carried a worn map, its parchment brittle with age, and a thirst for glory that burned brighter than any hearth fire. This journey, fraught with peril, was his destiny.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the cosmos a breathtaking canvas of vibrant colors and impossible geometries.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey stretched across light years, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of unlocking the galaxy’s greatest secrets, fueled her resolve.  Her ship, her crew, and the vast expanse of space were all that stood between her and the unknown.
