
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her cheeks.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey, spurred her onward, a determined glint in her eyes. The vastness of the land stretched before her, a canvas painted with challenges and, she hoped, eventual triumph.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the deafening silence of interstellar space.  Navigation charts pulsed with intricate constellations, each jump a gamble with the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Unlike the medieval paths of her ancestors, Eva's journey was measured not in days but in light-years, the cosmic expanse a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
