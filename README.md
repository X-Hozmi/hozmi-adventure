
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits a constant shadow.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new landscapes – sprawling forests teeming with unseen dangers, bustling medieval cities pulsing with life, and the chilling vastness of the steppe.  Our journey is a gamble, a test of endurance and resilience, fueled by hope and the whispers of distant lands brimming with untold riches and forgotten magic.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship slicing through the inky blackness, carries us on a mission to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and cosmic anomalies.  We encounter alien civilizations, both wondrous and terrifying, navigate asteroid fields glittering like celestial diamonds, and witness the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae painted across the cosmic canvas.  Our adventure is a scientific pilgrimage, a quest for knowledge and discovery limited only by the boundaries of imagination and the speed of light.
