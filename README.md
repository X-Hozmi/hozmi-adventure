
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a warning of impending war whispered by a dying hermit.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of the untamed wilderness. Each creaking wagon wheel and clop of hoof was a step closer to her destination, and a step closer to a fate uncertain but undeniably thrilling.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Navigation charts flickered on the bridge, showing the planned course through treacherous nebulae and uncharted asteroid fields.  The thrill wasn't just the breathtaking scenery of swirling cosmic dust and distant suns, but the unknown itself – the potential discovery of a new habitable planet, a new civilization, or even a new threat. The universe, a boundless ocean of stars, beckoned with endless possibilities.
