
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Rocamadour.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of whether she would reach her destination alive.  The whispering wind carried tales of mythical creatures and haunted forests, adding to the already palpable sense of adventure and mortal danger.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and rescue its presumed survivors.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  The vast expanse of the cosmos was both breathtaking and terrifying; a canvas painted with nebulae of iridescent colours, and the cold, unforgiving void between stars.  The weight of her responsibility, and the promise of discovery, pushed her onward across the unimaginable distances between planets.
