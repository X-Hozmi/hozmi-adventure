
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's caravan lumbered across the parched plains of Anatolia.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a heartbeat against the vast, silent landscape.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their arduous journey from Constantinople to the fabled Silk Road cities of the East.  The promise of untold riches and exotic spices fueled their courage, even as the sun beat down mercilessly, turning the shimmering horizon into a mirage of hope and despair.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known galaxy, faced alien threats and technological malfunctions with steely determination.  Their quest?  To discover the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel and a new era of interstellar peace. The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a lonely and dangerous frontier.
