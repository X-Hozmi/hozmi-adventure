
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving terrain.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a whispered legend amongst desert nomads, had been fraught with peril. Sandstorms threatened to bury her alive, bandits lurked in canyons, and the relentless heat sapped her strength. Yet, the lure of ancient secrets, of untold riches and possibly even magic, propelled her forward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to conquer this arduous path.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a commonplace event in the 27th century, but the Xylos Nebula remained a treacherous expanse, its unpredictable gravity wells and pirate infestations posing a constant threat. Ryla's mission: to retrieve a priceless artifact from a long-lost alien civilization, a prize worth risking the dangers of deep space.  The vibrant colours of the nebula painted a breathtaking, if deadly, backdrop to her daring expedition.
