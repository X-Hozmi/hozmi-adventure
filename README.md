
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of mythical creatures – griffins and basilisks –  kept her constantly vigilant. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the unwavering hope that fueled her onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring capacity for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a gamble with potentially galactic-scale consequences.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the occasional shudder of the ship against meteor showers, was a different kind of wilderness, demanding a different kind of courage.  Yet the thrill of exploration, the unknown stretching before her like an endless canvas of possibilities, resonated with the same potent drive that had propelled Elara across medieval Europe.
