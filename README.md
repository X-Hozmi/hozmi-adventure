
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the burning hope in her heart, fueled by the love for her sibling, propelled her across the unforgiving landscape, a tiny figure against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a silver needle piercing the cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a planet light-years from Earth.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and rogue space pirates; instead of starvation, the ever-present threat of system failure. But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, spurred her onward through the inky blackness, a solitary adventurer charting a course through the infinite expanse of the galaxy.
