
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the sea clinging to our roughspun clothes as we turned our backs on the ocean and headed inland.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way through the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence, then into the shadow of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in mountain passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of distant lands and untold riches, spurred us onward, our hearts pounding with the rhythm of our weary horses' hooves.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the silence of interstellar space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star lightyears from Earth.  The journey itself was an adventure, a blur of faster-than-light travel punctuated by the occasional navigational recalibration and the predictable anxieties of long-distance space travel.  Unlike the medieval travelers, we faced dangers far less tangible: radiation bursts, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction. But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the hope of discovering something entirely new fueled our relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
