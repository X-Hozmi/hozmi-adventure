
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Mire had taken its toll, leaving them mud-caked and provisions dwindling.  Yet, the whispered tales of the lost city of Eldoria, shimmering with gold and untold magic, fueled their relentless pursuit.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and wonder, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel and the immense rewards that awaited the bold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was a daily routine, a stark contrast to the cozy confines of her ship's bridge.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, reminded her of humanity's boundless ambition and the infinite possibilities that lay beyond the familiar constellations.
