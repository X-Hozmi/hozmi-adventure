
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's weary steed as she crested the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance.  Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto her face, mirroring the cracked earth beneath her horse's feet. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested her resilience, but the promise of sanctuary in the papal city, and the whispered tales of a lost artifact hidden within its walls, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination to reach her destination, a blend of fear and exhilaration fueling her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's controls.  Her mission: to locate a potential habitable planet beyond the known galaxy. The journey had already spanned years, light-years even, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unpredictable cosmic anomalies.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, but the potential reward – a new home for humanity – outweighed the risks a thousand times over.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both terror and untold wonder, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of the unknown.
