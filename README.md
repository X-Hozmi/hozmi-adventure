
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from the idyllic tales sung by bards.  Wolves howled in the distance, shadows played tricks on the eye, and the ever-present threat of bandits kept her hand close to the worn hilt of her dagger. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the dangers inherent in her quest to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding not with fear, but with the exhilarating thrill of interstellar travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and charting unknown star systems was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with starlight and cosmic dust, dwarfed even the most ambitious earthly explorations.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that tested not only her courage but also the limits of human ingenuity and the capabilities of her trusty spaceship.
