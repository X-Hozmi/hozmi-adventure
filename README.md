
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless sun, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape – from dense forests teeming with wild boar to sun-baked plains shimmering with heat haze. The journey tested his courage, his resilience, and his faith in the whispers that guided him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the expanding nebula decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling space pirates were just the beginning.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each planet a potential graveyard.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy offered little comfort, yet the hope of finding survivors, of understanding the colony's fate, fueled her crew's relentless pursuit across unimaginable distances.
