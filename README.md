
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, with each sunrise came the unwavering hope that spurred her onward, fueled by the bond with her sibling and the whisper of Eldoria's shimmering spires on the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission, far more ambitious than Elara's, was to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Instead of bandits, she faced rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies. Instead of starvation, the threat of system failures and the crushing weight of interstellar isolation. Yet, like Elara, she pressed on, driven by a similar hope—a future where humanity could thrive beyond the dying embers of its home world.
