
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend among her people, said to hold the cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  But the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, *The Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape of the Galactic Federation, but the discovery of Xylos – a planet teeming with a life-giving mineral – was worth the hassle.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of a thriving future for her people spurred her onward, a beacon guiding her through the vast, uncaring expanse of space.
