
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous, rutted track winding through the Bavarian forests.  Her mule, burdened with meager supplies, stumbled over unseen roots.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the chilling unknown of the vast, uncharted lands beyond the Black Forest – a journey undertaken to reach her estranged brother, rumored to have joined a mercenary company in the far east. The thrill of the unknown, a heady mix of fear and excitement, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Rax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, bucking against the unpredictable currents.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate mining planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous undertaking fraught with the dangers of space pirates, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure light years from any friendly spaceport. The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colors and deadly voids, presented a challenge as exhilarating as it was terrifying.
