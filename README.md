
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a road, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest, promising both adventure and peril.  Each bend concealed the possibility of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – rival knights vying for the same rumored treasure hidden deep within the haunted Blackwood valley.  His small band, a motley crew of seasoned warriors and nervous novices, pressed on, spurred by the promise of glory and the thrill of the unknown.  The weight of their packs and the chill of the approaching autumn did little to dampen their spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth, was fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the allure of discovering a new home, a fresh start for humanity amongst the stars, outweighed any fear.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of magic, an infinite possibility, just as thrilling as the wildest medieval quest.
