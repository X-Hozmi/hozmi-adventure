
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail glinting under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne, bandits a constant threat, and the whispers of war echoing from distant lands.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for peril, and for glory.  He carried with him not only his sword and shield, but the hope of finding a legendary lost city, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, across the inky blackness between galaxies. The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vista of swirling nebulae and distant, shimmering stars.  Her mission: to chart unexplored regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump into hyperspace held the promise of discovery, of unimaginable alien landscapes, and of the unknown dangers lurking in the vastness of space.
