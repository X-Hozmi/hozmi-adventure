
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering pines, the scent of pine needles and damp earth heavy in the air.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or the threat of bandit, beast, or worse. The journey, a tapestry woven with peril and hope, stretched endlessly before him.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, plotting a course through uncharted space to the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a rumored source of Xylos crystals, capable of powering faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held endless possibilities, but also the constant threat of asteroid fields, spatial anomalies, and unknown alien encounters.  The galaxy itself was her battlefield and her playground.
