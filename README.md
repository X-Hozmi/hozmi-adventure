
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort against the looming fear of bandits and the unknown.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and deliver a vital message to its reclusive king, had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of mythical creatures still echoed. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, every sunset a hard-earned rest beneath a canopy of stars.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Navigation charts were constantly updated, and communication with Earth was a faint whisper across the cosmic gulf. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of discovery or a deadly trap. The vast unknown stretched before her, a tapestry woven with starlight, mystery, and the thrill of the ultimate frontier.
