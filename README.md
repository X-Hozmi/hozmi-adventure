
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara's caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wagon wheels a constant counterpoint to the nervous bleating of her sheep.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the quiet relief of a hard-won campsite, the shared stories and warmth of the campfire their only comfort against the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the vessel's hyperdrive to its limits, but the potential rewards – a rare element vital to sustaining life on her drought-stricken home planet – outweighed the danger.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding rogue space pirates were commonplace hazards, but the true adventure lay in the unknown, in the breathtaking beauty of unexplored star systems and the tantalizing promise of discovery hidden amongst the distant constellations.
