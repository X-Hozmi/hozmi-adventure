
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies and a heart full of reckless hope, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the treacherous Black Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and mortal danger.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of the plague stalked his every step, yet the lure of the unknown propelled him forward, a single candle flickering against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet within the Andromeda galaxy, a desperate gamble for humanity's survival.  Faster-than-light travel strained the ship's systems, the void a constant reminder of the immense distances and unforgiving dangers.  Cosmic storms, pirate raiders, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar space were ever-present threats, but the hope of finding a new home burned brighter than any star, pushing her and her crew towards the uncharted edges of existence.
