
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  Yet, the unwavering glint of hope in her eyes burned brighter than the midday sun, fueling her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanite to the distant colony of Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with life but desperately short on resources. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate cruisers, and battling the unpredictable warp currents were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the immense distances and incredible risks involved in galactic trade.
