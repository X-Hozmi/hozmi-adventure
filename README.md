
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought the chilling beauty of a vast, unknown landscape, a tapestry woven with peril and the allure of the unknown.  He carried with him not only a map etched onto parchment brittle with age, but also the unwavering hope of a discovery that would change his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amongst the swirling cosmic dust.  The ship, a marvel of futuristic engineering, battled gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields, while Eva navigated by the faint starlight and the cryptic readings of her advanced sensors.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced not only the physical dangers of interstellar travel, but also the psychological strain of isolation and the ever-present uncertainty of the vast, uncharted cosmos.
