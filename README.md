
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the constant threat of famine gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing village, spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed testament to her unwavering hope.

But the allure of discovering a new habitable world, a potential new home for a dying Aethel, fueled her crew's courage, their determination as bright as the distant stars they charted.
