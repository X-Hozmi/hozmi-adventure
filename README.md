
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains crimson.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a king's desperate plea – a scroll detailing a lost, mythical herb said to cure the Black Death ravaging his kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Yet, the hope in her heart, as fierce as the desert wind, spurred her onward, her journey a tapestry woven with peril and the unwavering pursuit of a cure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with life, but also guarded by fiercely territorial Xylan warriors.  Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps, dodging pirates and bureaucratic red tape, was all part of a day's work for Ryla. The vast, unknowable cosmos held both wonder and danger, a thrilling cocktail she'd happily sip, fuelled by the ever-present hum of the warp drive and the promise of untold riches – or perhaps, a heroic sacrifice.
