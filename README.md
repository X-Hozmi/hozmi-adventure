
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, her worn map clutched in a calloused hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, propelled her onward.  The whispers promised untold riches and ancient secrets, a reward worth risking life and limb to attain.  The journey was a tapestry woven with breathtaking beauty and gnawing fear, a true test of endurance and courage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kerrigan steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a stark contrast to the cold vacuum of space, masked the dangers lurking within – rogue asteroids, pirate vessels, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding unparalleled skill and bravery.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held the promise of new worlds and untold knowledge, a celestial odyssey only the boldest dared to undertake.
