
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the dangers of brigands, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a swollen river to ford, a hostile lord to appease, a whispered tale of mythical beasts guarding a forgotten path.  Yet, with every hardship, a fierce determination burned within him, fueled by faith and the promise of adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with the familiar thrill of the unknown.  Interstellar travel held its own unique brand of peril: volatile wormholes, pirate raids in the void, and the chilling loneliness of deep space.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and uncharted territories – worlds teeming with alien life and breathtaking landscapes – outweighed any risk.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the infinite possibilities of the cosmos.
