The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless journey.  Whispers of a lost city, brimming with ancient magic and untold riches, spurred him and his small band of companions across the treacherous landscape.

But the potential scientific breakthroughs far outweighed the risks for Eva and her crew, who dared to push the boundaries of human exploration across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
