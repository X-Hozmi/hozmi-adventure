The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the whispering pines, snaked towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.

The vast, unknown cosmos offered unparalleled adventure, yet the loneliness of deep space and the constant vigilance required for survival were a heavy price to pay for the glory of galactic exploration.
