
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh indifference of nature itself.  He carried with him only a meager supply of food, his faith, and a map older than his grandfather. This journey was a gamble against the odds, a desperate dance with fate across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The vast emptiness of space, however, was far more terrifying than any terrestrial threat; isolation and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile alien lifeforms, formed the true peril of her intergalactic expedition.
