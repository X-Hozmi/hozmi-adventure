
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties destined for a monastery far beyond the Sultan's reach.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the allure of distant lands and the whispered promise of a bountiful harvest spurred her onward. Each arduous mile was a step closer to her goal, a testament to human resilience against the untamed wilderness of medieval Europe and the Near East.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming microbes to a newly discovered planet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the eerie beauty of celestial phenomena, held a different kind of peril.  Warp storms threatened to tear her ship apart, alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at her crew. Yet, the hope of creating a new home for humanity amongst the stars fueled their unwavering journey across the galactic expanse.
