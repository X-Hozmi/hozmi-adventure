
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn boots pounded the rutted track.  His retinue, a motley collection of knights and squires, trailed behind, their faces grim under the relentless sun.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Every creak of their wagons, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the creeping shadow of despair itself.  Their journey was a desperate gamble against time and the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space offered its own unique dangers, from rogue gravitational wells to hostile alien species, but the promise of untold discovery fueled their relentless journey across the galaxy.
