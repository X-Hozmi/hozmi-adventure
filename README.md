
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary steed across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Ys, a shimmering beacon of hope in the grim landscape, spur him onward, a lone knight against a vast and hostile world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's boundless ambition.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the cosmic expanse isn't just a journey through space; it's a voyage through time, the ship hurtling through nebulae and asteroid fields, facing the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  Elara and her crew are pioneers, venturing into the unknown, their courage a flickering candle against the immense, uncaring darkness of the galaxy.
