
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of the distant sun, the thrill of the unknown, kept him pressing on, his heart filled with a desperate, burning hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the relentless decay of interstellar travel tested her crew to their limits.  Yet, the promise of rediscovery, of finding lost kin, propelled them forward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving darkness of space.
