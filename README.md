
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid delivered to a distant sultan.  Bandits, scorching heat, and treacherous mountain passes are constant threats, but the unwavering gaze of the setting sun and the promise of salvation fuel her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each pounding hoofbeat, is a step closer to her destination, a gamble on fate and human kindness in a world teeming with both.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky expanse of space offers a different kind of peril - cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, propels her forward.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a testament to human ingenuity and the unyielding desire to explore the unknown.
