
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with days of bone-jarring ruts, nights spent huddled around crackling fires under a vast, indifferent sky, and the constant threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – fording swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present fear of disease or starvation.  Yet, with every league conquered, the spirit of adventure burned brighter, fueled by a fervent faith and the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, the cosmos a breathtaking spectacle of vibrant colours and celestial wonders. Their mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable worlds for a humanity spread thin across the known arms of the Milky Way.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – but the thrill of discovery, the push towards the unknown, remained the same driving force that had propelled adventurers for millennia.
