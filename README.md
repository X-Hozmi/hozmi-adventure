
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Every rustle of leaves, every shadow cast by the ancient trees, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unseen horrors lurking in the heart of the wilderness.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, but fueled by hope.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth, the destination of her perilous expedition.  While the dangers were different – asteroid fields, hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of system failure – the thrill of discovery, the uncharted territories, and the relentless push against the unknown mirrored the spirit of those medieval adventurers.  The galaxy was her forest, and the stars her guiding lights.
