
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than her grandfather, its parchment brittle with age.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic, a prize worth the dangers of brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise was a gamble, each sunset a prayer for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the nebulae outside swirling into a kaleidoscope of cosmic fire. His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, was a battered but reliable vessel, having traversed countless light-years and skirted more than one black hole.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylos crystals to the Kepler-186f colony, a journey fraught with peril from pirate raids and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself. The galaxy held vast fortunes, but the price of reaching them remained eternally high.
