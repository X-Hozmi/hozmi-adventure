
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and horse sweat clinging to her homespun tunic.  Her journey from the windswept highlands to the bustling port city of Marseilles was fraught with peril: brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, a new vista unfolded – rolling hills giving way to sun-drenched vineyards, the promise of trade and adventure fueling her weary limbs. The whispers of a legendary lost city fueled her relentless westward push, a lure stronger than any hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with the dangers of unknown celestial phenomena and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, each jump a gamble. But the vastness of the cosmos, the potential for discovery at every jump point, outweighed the risks. The promise of new worlds, new civilizations, and unimaginable wonders spurred her on, a legacy far grander than any medieval quest.
