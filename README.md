
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Provence, a worn map clutched in her hand.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria is fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders fuel her onward.  The clang of her armour, the rhythmic thud of her horse's hooves, mark her passage through a world both beautiful and brutal.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust*.  The cosmos stretches before him, a breathtaking tapestry of vibrant colours and distant galaxies.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, flung across the vastness of space centuries ago.  Faster-than-light travel brings its own set of dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system malfunctions.  But Rexx, hardened by years of exploration, presses on, driven by the hope of finding the lost colonists and unraveling the mystery of their disappearance.
