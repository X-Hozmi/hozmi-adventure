
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth fought with the stench of unwashed bodies in the crowded caravan.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Yet, the promise of the fabled Sunstone, hidden within its shadowed depths, spurred her on.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a test of her courage and resourcefulness in this harsh, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown beckoned.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring drone against the vast, silent expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding rogue gravitational pulls was a daily challenge, but the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new life, fueled her crew.  The cosmos held infinite mysteries, and Eva, at the helm of her ship, was ready to uncover them, one star system at a time.
