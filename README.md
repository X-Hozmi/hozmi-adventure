
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, a cacophony of seagulls and shouting merchants a stark contrast to the quiet, dusty road ahead.  Our caravan, a motley collection of  oxen, packhorses, and weary travelers, creaked its way across the sun-baked Provençal countryside.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the promise of reaching the fabled Silk Road, with its treasures and exotic spices, spurred us onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship boasting engines capable of warping spacetime, cut through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess life forms far beyond our current understanding.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks but in years spent under the watchful eye of the AI navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, battling cosmic radiation, and facing the ever-present risk of encountering unforeseen celestial phenomena. But the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life makes every risk worth taking, an adventure beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers.
