
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her loyal steed, Zephyr, traverse the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fuels their trek across the varied landscapes, from the rolling hills of France to the rugged Spanish mountains – a testament to human endurance and the unwavering pursuit of a distant, sacred goal.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  This is not a pilgrimage, but a desperate search for a habitable planet amidst the dying embers of the old galactic empire.  Warp jumps carry her across unimaginable distances, each one a gamble against unforeseen celestial events.  Alien landscapes, breathtaking and terrifying in equal measure, flash past her viewport – vibrant jungle planets choked with poisonous flora, desolate ice worlds concealing hidden dangers, and asteroid fields that threaten to shatter her vessel.  The vastness of space, both wondrous and perilous, is her constant companion.
