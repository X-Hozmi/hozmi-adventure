
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of pack animals and weary travellers, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, each sunset the chilling possibility of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a city whispered to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fuels our relentless journey, pushing us onward despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present fear. The very air crackles with anticipation, a mixture of dread and thrilling uncertainty.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Starseeker* cuts through the inky blackness of intergalactic space, its engines humming a low, hypnotic song.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space holds its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the promise of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, of charting a course through the unmapped expanse of the galaxy, outweighs all risk. The hum of the engines is the soundtrack to a future unwritten.
