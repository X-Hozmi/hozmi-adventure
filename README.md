
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Ys, a pilgrimage fueled by whispers of ancient magic and unimaginable riches, a journey fraught with bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose driving her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s vibrant hues.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a perilous dance through asteroid fields, navigating treacherous gravitational pulls and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  Ryla’s crew, a ragtag bunch bound by a shared thirst for discovery, faced down cosmic storms and repaired vital systems under the cold gaze of distant stars.  The quest for Xylos was a gamble, but the potential rewards – a universe unbound – made the risk worthwhile.
