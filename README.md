
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Ys, a mythical haven whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, a place said to hold unimaginable riches and power.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences in her quest for glory and escape from a life of quiet desperation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of space.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she plotted a course to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the vast expanse between worlds held dangers far greater than any medieval bandit: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets lurked in the darkness.  Yet, the possibility of forging a new era of galactic unity fueled her courage and propelled her forward, defying the unimaginable distances between worlds.
