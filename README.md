
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous highlands had been brutal; bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested his mettle.  But the promise of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to lie hidden in the forgotten ruins of Eldoria, fueled his relentless pursuit. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of surviving another day in a land both beautiful and unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust*.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vast distances between galaxies still demanded careful planning and unwavering courage.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and alien life forms.  The cosmos, while magnificent, was a perilous ocean, and the crew of the *Stardust* were but a tiny vessel venturing into its uncharted depths.
