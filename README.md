
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the Spine of the World mountains loomed, a jagged, unforgiving barrier between me and my destination.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this pilgrimage across the known world, a journey fueled by a desperate search for a rumored lost city said to hold the cure for my sister's illness.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset a stark reminder of the perilous path still ahead.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  Unlike the medieval treks of my ancestors, this journey was measured not in weeks or months, but in light-years, traversing nebulae and avoiding asteroid fields with the precision of a celestial surgeon.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, the potential for hostile alien encounters – but the thrill of discovery, the yearning to push the boundaries of the known, remained a potent, timeless force.
