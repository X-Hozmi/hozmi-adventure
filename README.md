
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her weathered face.  Ahead, the treacherous Serpent's Pass wound its way through jagged peaks, a legendary route rumored to hold both untold riches and certain death.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine – not just from the cold mountain air, but from the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, a planet teeming with unknown possibilities and dangers.  Hyperdrive hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through the ship, a counterpoint to the silence of the void.  The journey was fraught with perils – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the promise of a new world spurred Jax and her crew onward, across the light-years, towards the unknown.
