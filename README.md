The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, promised both peril and untold riches.  Whispers of a lost Templar monastery, overflowing with gold and ancient secrets, fueled his relentless journey.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, threatened ambush from bandits, wild beasts, or perhaps something far more sinister dwelling in the heart of the woods.  His only companions were his trusty sword, a dwindling supply of hardtack, and the unwavering hope of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, was a trial of both skill and endurance.  Yet, the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories in the vast expanse of the cosmos, spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer traversing a universe of endless possibilities.
