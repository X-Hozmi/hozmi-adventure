
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun baking the cracked earth of the Rhône valley. Her quest: to reach Avignon, a rumored haven for alchemists holding the secret to a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumour along the way, fueled her desperate journey, a tapestry woven with fear, hope, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests. The road was long, the challenges innumerable, but the potential reward… priceless.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals to the distant Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the peril of rogue asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. The galaxy held wonders beyond imagining, but the unforgiving void between the stars demanded respect, and a single mistake could mean the difference between a successful delivery and oblivion.
