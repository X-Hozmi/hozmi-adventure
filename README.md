
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth’s chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest – to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Carpathian Mountains, said to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland – felt as vast and unforgiving as the landscape itself.  Every creak of saddle leather, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the creeping despair of his own mortality.  He pressed on, driven by a desperate hope that defied the grim reality surrounding him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent gases a breathtaking yet treacherous backdrop to her journey.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only clue.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child’s play compared to the political maneuvering and interstellar piracy she had to contend with. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a constant, gnawing loneliness, punctuated only by the hum of the ship’s engines and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
