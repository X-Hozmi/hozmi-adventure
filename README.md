
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map promising riches in the far East, felt like a lead weight on his back.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  He dreamt not of gold, but of simply reaching his destination, a distant city whispered about in taverns, a place of wonder and opportunity beyond the limitations of his village.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been smoother than expected, but the thrill of navigating uncharted space, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the promise of discovering a new habitable world kept her heart pounding.  Ahead lay the unknown – alien civilizations, potentially hostile environments, and the sheer breathtaking beauty of a cosmos brimming with untold mysteries.  The risks were immense, but the potential rewards, for humanity and herself, were equally boundless.
