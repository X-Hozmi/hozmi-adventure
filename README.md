
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn leather boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, wild beasts, and treacherous terrain all lay between him and his goal.  The journey tested his courage, his faith, and the very limits of his endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's systems.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped celestial bodies, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Each jump to lightspeed was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos, but the promise of new worlds and unprecedented scientific discoveries spurred her onwards.
