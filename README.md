
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Kaelan, his armor heavy with dust and the weight of a thousand anxieties, spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elara, a journey that had already taken him across treacherous mountain passes, through bandit-infested forests, and across sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous rivers, warring factions, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the unwavering hope of success fueled his relentless pursuit across the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for Elara and her crew.  The vastness of the cosmos presented a breathtaking, terrifying beauty, each jump a gamble, each star a potential destination – or grave.
