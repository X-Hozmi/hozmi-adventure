
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Elara's small caravan trudged onward.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each strained breath of her weary mule, was a testament to their perilous journey across the ravaged countryside.  Their goal: the mythical Sunstone city whispered to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The lure of untold riches and ancient secrets, however, spurred them onward, their hearts pounding with a mix of fear and exhilarating hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve the fabled Kryll crystals from the remote planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be guarded by sentient storms and ancient, powerful technology.   With his ragtag crew of seasoned spacefarers, Razor navigated asteroid fields, evaded pirate patrols, and battled cosmic anomalies – the perils of interstellar travel a far cry from Elara's earthly struggles, but equally perilous in their own right.  The cosmos held its own bounty, but demanded a steep price for its treasures.
