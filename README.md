
Sir Reginald, his surcoat dusty and stained, urged his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down on the parched earth as he traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, his quest for the lost city of Eldoria a burning ember in his heart.

The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a testament to the boundless possibilities and the inherent dangers of interstellar exploration.
