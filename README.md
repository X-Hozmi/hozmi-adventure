
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the dusty plains of France.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a whispered rumour of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests, the breathtaking sight of a snow-capped mountain range piercing the azure sky, the comforting warmth of a crackling fire in a humble village inn.  Every mile is a gamble, a test of endurance against the elements and the unpredictable nature of medieval life; the reward, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Constantinople, a jewel shimmering at the edge of the known world.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged from starlight and ambition, cuts through the inky black, hurtling between nebulae painted across the cosmos like divine brushstrokes.  We traverse wormholes that fold space and time, encountering alien landscapes that defy imagination – crimson deserts on Kepler-186f, sentient crystal forests on Xylos. The thrill isn't just in the journey, but the sheer audacity of it, the relentless pushing of boundaries across unimaginable distances, the constant possibility of discovery, both wondrous and terrifying, in a universe teeming with the unknown.
