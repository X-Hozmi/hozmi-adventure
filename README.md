
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by traveling merchants.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the lure of the legendary city, and the whispered tales of its untold riches and ancient knowledge, fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a desperate hope for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebulae of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp jumps were risky, pirate raids a constant concern, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at his crew. But the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the mystery of Kepler's disappearance, propelled them forward, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of the cosmos.
