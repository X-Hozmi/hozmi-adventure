
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Days bled into weeks of muddy tracks, meager rations, and the constant threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought the daunting prospect of another day's slog, yet the unwavering faith fueling their journey, and the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, kept their spirits afloat.  The thrill of the unknown, the vastness of the land unfolding before them, made the hardship worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring tapestry of stars and swirling gas clouds, was nothing compared to the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery, the chance to unravel ancient galactic mysteries, fueled her unwavering courage in the face of cosmic uncertainty.
