
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Eldoria’s healing waters spur him onward, a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness and disease.  His journey is a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a desperate dream.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the void between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms is commonplace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, amplifies the loneliness of her journey, but the possibility of finding survivors – of uncovering the secrets behind Xylos's disappearance – fuels her determination.  The galaxy is their battlefield, and the fate of a lost civilization rests on her courage and skill.
