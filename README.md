
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of pine and damp earth fills her nostrils, a welcome contrast to the stench of fear that clings to her memory – fear of bandits, of starvation, of the unknown lands that lie beyond the next ridge.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the thrill, a constant reminder that survival depends on her wits and her courage in this unforgiving, beautiful world.  She travels not for riches, but for a whispered legend, a hidden valley said to hold a cure for her ailing brother.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course for the unmapped galaxy of Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a lullaby against the cosmic silence, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the occasional alarm.  His crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and mercenaries, are a family forged in the fires of shared risk and impossible odds.  Their quest?  Not gold or glory, but the whispers of an ancient civilization, a lost technology said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretches before them, a boundless ocean of stars and untold wonders.
