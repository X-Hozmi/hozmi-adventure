
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather jerkin chafed, but the thrill of the unknown—a whispered rumour of a lost city shimmering with gold—outweighed any discomfort.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger or discovery. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of the plague were constant companions on this perilous journey across the heart of Europe, but the promise of adventure burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, the swirling nebulae a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, masking the vastness of space and the potential dangers lurking in the unexplored sectors.  Pirate raids were a constant threat, as were unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present risk of equipment failure millions of light-years from home. But the allure of the unknown, the chance to push the boundaries of human exploration, propelled them onward, towards the edge of the galaxy and beyond.
