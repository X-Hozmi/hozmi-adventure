
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara's small band pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them like dark wings.  Their journey from York to Jerusalem was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow their meager supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the Holy City, the whispered tales of exotic spices and unimaginable wealth, fueled their weary steps, a beacon against the bleak landscape of their arduous pilgrimage.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos casting an eerie light upon the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy. Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and pirate raids a constant threat, but the promise of untold technological advancements and the hope of reuniting with long-lost kin spurred them onward, a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
