
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies and a map older than her grandfather.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse. Yet, the promise of the fabled Silk Road, with its exotic spices and whispered tales of unimaginable wealth, spurred her onward. The dangers were real, the path arduous, but the allure of the unknown fueled her weary steps towards a horizon painted with both peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, her breath catching in her throat as the kaleidoscopic colors of Xylos's rings shimmered before them.  This wasn't a journey across dusty plains, but a voyage across light-years, a leap into the uncharted expanse between galaxies. While pirates still roamed the cosmos, their threat paled in comparison to the mysteries hidden within the swirling gas clouds, the unmapped planets promising both breathtaking wonders and terrifying unknowns.  The adventure was a different scale, but the human thirst for discovery remained timeless.
