
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed onward.  My destination: Constantinople, a fabled city shimmering on the horizon of my dreams, a destination reached only by braving treacherous mountain passes, dodging thieving bandits, and bartering for meager rations in forgotten villages. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape to conquer; from sun-drenched valleys to snow-covered peaks, the journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for exploration.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts a silent path through the nebula, vibrant colours painting the viewport.  The destinations are not villages or cities, but planets teeming with alien life, or desolate moons orbiting gas giants.  The challenge isn't bandits but gravitational anomalies and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  Each jump to warp speed is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by the boundless human curiosity that pushed our ancestors across continents and now propels us across galaxies.
