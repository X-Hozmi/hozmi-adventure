
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest, promising both peril and reward.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the wolves and bandits that stalked these shadowed woods.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the key to ending a devastating plague – was a dangerous gamble, yet the hope of salvation fueled his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry of shimmering nebulas, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present hum of the hyperdrive.  Navigating the treacherous cosmic currents was a test of skill and courage, a far cry from the dangers of a medieval forest.  Yet, like Reginald before her, Eva was driven by a powerful hope, the possibility of a new beginning for humanity among the stars.
