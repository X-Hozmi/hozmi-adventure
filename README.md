
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s weary steed as he crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him. His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic, had taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over sun-baked plains where the very air shimmered with heat. Each day brought new challenges:  negotiating with suspicious villagers, navigating by the stars alone, and constantly fending off the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  The journey itself was as much an adventure as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant, uncharted galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dreams, yet the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, while navigating treacherous asteroid fields demanded absolute precision and unwavering nerve.  Communication with Earth was spotty, and the loneliness of deep space pressed in on her, a heavy weight only countered by the thrill of exploration and the promise of discovering something truly extraordinary beyond the known cosmos.
