
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous.  He carried with him a king's ransom in silks and spices, a desperate gamble to reach the distant port of Genoa before winter's grip truly tightened. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the perils lurking in his path – a path he hoped would lead to fortune, or perhaps, only a grave.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a sleek vessel capable of warping space-time, pulsed with energy as it jumped between star systems.  The mission: to locate the fabled Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  But the vast emptiness held its own dangers: rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space all threatened her journey, a pilgrimage across the cosmic ocean fuelled by ambition and the hope of discovery.
