
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a chipped map, a few dried rations, and the silver locket containing her brother's portrait.  This journey to the distant monastery, rumored to hold the cure for his wasting sickness, was a perilous undertaking, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson gas swirling around his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  But the cosmos held dangers far exceeding any medieval bandit – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of the Kryll, a parasitic species that could consume entire starships.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the galaxy, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.
