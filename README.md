
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and whispers of the Black Death followed her like a chilling breath.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience as she sought to reach the fabled city of Constantinople, carrying a vital message that could save her people.  The miles stretched before her, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of terraforming algae to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars, Eva relied on her wits and advanced technology to overcome the challenges of interstellar travel. The vast, inky blackness of space held both wonder and danger, a stark contrast to the familiar comforts of Earth, but the promise of a new beginning spurred her onward, across the unimaginable distances that separated worlds.
