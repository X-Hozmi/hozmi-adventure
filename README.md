
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was proving longer and more perilous than anticipated. Bandit raids were commonplace, and the whispers of a monstrous beast haunting the Black Mire added a chilling note to each campfire story.  Yet, the promise of untold riches and the glory awaiting a knight who successfully delivered the King's message spurred him on, each sunrise a fresh challenge and each sunset a testament to his endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast distances and unpredictable cosmic phenomena presented a constant threat, from rogue asteroids to the unpredictable gravitational forces of black holes.  But the chance to discover a new home for humanity, and the thrill of charting the unknown, fueled Ryla’s unwavering determination, making each jump to hyperspace a breathtaking leap into the future.
