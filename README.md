
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Ahead, the Pyrenees Mountains loom, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored hidden monastery holding the lost scrolls of Saint Illumina.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature are constant companions on this perilous journey, but the thrill of the unknown fuels her onward, a fire brighter than any hearth.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make this interstellar voyage a constant test of skill and courage. Yet, the allure of discovering a new world, a new civilization, overrides every fear, driving her across the galaxy in a quest for the extraordinary.
