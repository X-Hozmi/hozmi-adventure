
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary oxen, slogs across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each sunrise brings the promise of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown fuels our journey – the whispered legends of a lost city, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, drive us onward despite the hardships.  Every rustle in the brush, every distant hawk's cry, sends shivers of both fear and exhilarating anticipation down our spines.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out the anxieties of interstellar travel.  We're hurtling towards Kepler-186f, a planet bathed in the red glow of its star, a world teeming with possibilities both wondrous and terrifying.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, share a common bond: the insatiable thirst for discovery.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant nebulae, is a breathtaking backdrop to our perilous quest to chart new worlds and unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.
