
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of sickness.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new landscape to navigate. Yet, the allure of the legendary shrine, the whisper of adventure in the wind, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, breathtaking backdrop of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the ship's controls.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted planets.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – the thrill of discovery, the sheer scale of the unknown, mirrored the spirit of those medieval adventurers who had braved the earth's untamed wilds.  The cosmos was their new frontier.
