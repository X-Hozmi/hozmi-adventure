
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promised a legendary lost city rumored to hold unimaginable riches.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of adventure fueling her quest, pushed her onward, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failures in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets, of charting a course through the unmapped cosmos, drove her and her crew forward, tiny specks of humanity braving the infinite darkness.
