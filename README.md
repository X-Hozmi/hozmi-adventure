
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zaragoza before winter's grip tightened. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of mythical beasts echoed through the windswept passes, but the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel and distant hawk cry was a chapter in her unfolding adventure, a testament to the courage it took to navigate a world both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from the bustling spaceports of Neo-Terra.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue subspace currents, and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raids were all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar explorer. The vastness of space, peppered with the glittering jewels of distant suns, held a different kind of peril, but the lure of discovery – of new life, new worlds – burned brighter than any star.
