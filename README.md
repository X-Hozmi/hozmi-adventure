
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions. Each sunrise brought new challenges, yet the unwavering spirit of the faithful propelled her onward, a testament to the human will to overcome obstacles in a time when travel was a gamble with fate itself.


Millennia later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as she charted a course through unmapped territories, seeking a fabled planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Asteroids whizzed past, a symphony of danger in the vast, inky expanse.  The thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, was a siren's call – a stark contrast to the perils of asteroid fields and potentially hostile alien civilizations, yet a temptation Jax embraced without hesitation.
