
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled behind them, a brown cloud chasing the small caravan as they journeyed towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils they faced, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of uncertainty to their quest for forgotten glory and untold riches.  The call of adventure, however, burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The jump gates were temperamental, wormholes unpredictable, and the vast emptiness of space held unseen dangers that could rip her ship apart.  But the promise of discovering a new civilization, a people lost to time, spurred her on. The cosmos, a breathtaking and terrifying expanse, held its secrets close, and Elara was determined to unveil them.
