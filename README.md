
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising the legendary Sunstone, said to hold untold power.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, but the allure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, spurred her onward, through bandit-ridden forests and across treacherous mountain passes, toward a destiny shrouded in mystery.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the erratic jumps of rival corporations also chasing the prize.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held a different kind of peril than medieval bandits – the unknown, the potential for catastrophic failure, and the ever-present threat of celestial anomalies. But the lure of discovery, the promise of pushing human boundaries, fueled her unwavering resolve.
