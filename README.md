
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his resolve, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his grit, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship and the intoxicating allure of the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage fraught with gravitational anomalies and unknown alien entities.  The ship, a marvel of futuristic engineering, hummed with energy as Eva navigated asteroid fields and navigated temporal distortions, her crew a diverse band of scientists and explorers bound by a shared thirst for discovery, facing the breathtaking vastness of space with courage and a healthy dose of apprehension.
