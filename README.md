
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Carcassonne, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit lords lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the land, a greater threat than any armed foe.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and perilous asteroid fields.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars and nebulas, held both breathtaking wonder and the chilling possibility of encountering the unknown, the uncharted, and the potentially hostile.  The adventure lay not just in reaching her destination, but in surviving the journey.
