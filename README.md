
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate race against time.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed them like a shroud.  Each creak of their saddle, each splash of mud on their worn leather boots, marked another step closer to their uncertain fate, a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  The vastness of the land itself, both a source of beauty and peril, dwarfed their small party in its endless expanse.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away.  Faster-than-light travel masked the true distances, but the perilous journey was far from smooth.  Asteroids, rogue gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept her crew on edge, a constant battle against the unforgiving vastness of space, where the only certainty was the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.
