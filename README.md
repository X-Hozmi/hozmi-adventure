
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  Each creak of the saddle leather was a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of hooves, a steady beat against the vast, unknown landscape.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine whispered to hold miraculous healing powers, was a dangerous gamble against bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Every sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, and every sunset the quiet terror of the encroaching night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting constant against the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of space.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – the thrill of exploration, the uncharted territories, and the unwavering pursuit of the unknown echoed the adventures of her medieval forebears.  The only difference was the scale.
