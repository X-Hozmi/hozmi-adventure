
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean still clinging to our clothes as we traded the familiar for the unknown.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way across the harsh, sun-baked landscape of Provence.  Each sunrise revealed new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every league traversed, the thrill of discovery intensified, fueled by whispered tales of exotic spices in the East and the legendary city of Samarkand.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The crimson dust of Mars still coats the boots of the intrepid crew of the 'Starseeker', as we prepare for the jump to Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of space remains humbling.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the potential for celestial anomalies or unforeseen mechanical failures. But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds teeming with uncharted wonders, makes the risk worthwhile. The galaxy awaits.
