
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of bread, and a well-worn map – were my only companions on this perilous journey to the distant city of Prague, seeking a rumored cure for my ailing brother. Each creak of the branches, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, a potent reminder of the unpredictable dangers that awaited at every turn.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion, a low thrum against the backdrop of the star-dusted void.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet light-years from Earth, promising untold riches in the form of a rare mineral called Xylanium.  The crew, a diverse group of explorers from across the galaxy, faced dangers far removed from bandits and mythical beasts; asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction tested our skills and resolve. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed our ship, a tiny speck on a canvas of infinite possibility and unimaginable peril.
