
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward. The chilling wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aquitaine, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind. His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy embrace of the Black Forest, where whispers of brigands and worse things haunted the twilight.  Each sunrise brought new peril, each sunset a desperate scramble for shelter from the elements and the ever-present threat of violence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing crippling warp-core malfunctions were all in a day's work.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas of celestial wonders, but also held dangers far more terrifying than any earthly bandit.  The loneliness of interstellar travel, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies made this journey a far different kind of adventure, yet equally fraught with peril and exhilaration.
