
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scroll of King Arthur.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, and the whispered promise of glory, spurred him relentlessly towards his unknown destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's burgeoning spacefaring civilization.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders and the constant hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of peril.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the potential encounter with unknown alien lifeforms were hazards far removed from the medieval knight's struggles, yet equally demanding of courage and resourcefulness.
