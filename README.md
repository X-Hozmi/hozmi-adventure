
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming under the relentless sun, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely a track through the overgrown forest of Arden, was treacherous. Bandits lurked in the shadows, whispered rumours of monstrous beasts in the swamp ahead, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, pushed him ever forward, a solitary figure against the vast, untamed wilderness of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset, a hard-earned victory.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden gravitational anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers was commonplace.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, was both exhilarating and deeply isolating.  The fate of an entire civilization rested on her shoulders, a weight she carried with grim determination across the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
