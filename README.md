
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in stolen relics, a map promising untold riches tucked into his boot.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the trials he faced on his perilous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula shimmering with cosmic dust and the ghosts of exploded suns.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Facing perilous asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the constant threat of engine failure light years from civilization,  Elara and her crew pressed onward, driven by the promise of discovery and the insatiable human hunger for the unknown vastness of space.
