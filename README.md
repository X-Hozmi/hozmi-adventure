
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried bread and a worn map, promising riches and perhaps, salvation, in the distant city of Avignon.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unpredictable whims of fate and the harsh reality of medieval travel. The thrill of the unknown, however, fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory void-squid was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the political minefield of competing galactic empires, each vying for control of Kepler-186f's resources.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless dangers, but the promise of discovery and the chance to rewrite the history of spacefaring civilizations kept Rexa and her crew pushing forward, their journey a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of the unknown.
