
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered legends of Ys, and the desperate hope for salvation, fueled their weary legs and spurred them across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from their home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Facing down cosmic storms, navigating asteroid fields, and outmaneuvering pirate raiders were all part of a typical day's work. But the allure of the unknown, and the potential to save countless lives, pushed them onward through the infinite darkness of space,  a journey as perilous and exhilarating as any medieval knight's quest.
