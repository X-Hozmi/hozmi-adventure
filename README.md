
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland. The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of his resolve. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the grim reality of a journey far from over.  His only companions were his loyal squire and the unwavering hope that the whispers of Zerzura held truth.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the vastness of space held its own terrors: rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the infinite expanse, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f’s disappearance.
