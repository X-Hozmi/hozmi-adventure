
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each arduous step, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the holy city a beacon in the encroaching darkness.  She carried with her not just a worn map and a meager supply of food, but a heart brimming with hope and the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  Vast, swirling colours filled the viewport, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders far removed from the mundane realities of Earth.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable hazards of space – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, possibly hostile, alien civilizations. Yet the allure of discovery, the promise of finding new worlds and charting uncharted territories, propelled her forward, a lone voyager in the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
