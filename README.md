
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent winding through the unforgiving Rhône valley, creaked under the weight of supplies and hope.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown – a whispered legend of a hidden monastery, the threat of bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the breathtaking beauty of untamed landscapes.  Our destination, the mythical city of  Aethelred, lay beyond the treacherous Alps, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold riches and the fulfillment of a desperate quest.  Every mile was a battle against fatigue, hunger, and the constant shadow of uncertainty.

Centuries later, the Althea, our starship, sliced through the inky black between galaxies.  The hyperspace jump was a jarring, disorienting experience, but the breathtaking panorama that greeted us upon emergence – a nebula painted in swirling colours of emerald and amethyst, dwarfing even the largest terrestrial storms – was worth it.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Cygnus X-1 region, mapping uncatalogued planets and searching for habitable worlds. The risks were monumental - uncharted gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the vast emptiness of space, yet the allure of discovery fueled our every action.
