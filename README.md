The journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest had been brutal; bandits had tested their mettle, storms had battered their resolve, and the gnawing hunger had threatened to break them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the vast, inky canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was perilous, fraught with asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The loneliness of deep space pressed in, a heavy blanket against the thrill of discovery.  But the possibility of finding life, of expanding humanity’s reach across the galaxy, was a siren song she couldn't resist.
