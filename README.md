Her worn map, more faded than useful, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or disaster. This journey to the distant monastery, seeking a cure for her ailing brother, was a perilous gamble, a test of her resilience and faith against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant colours of dying stars painted the cockpit, a stark contrast to the cold efficiency of her controls.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien languages, Ryla faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travellers.  The galaxy was a vast and unforgiving frontier, but the promise of a groundbreaking discovery fueled her unwavering determination.
