
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a perilous route to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving elements.  The promise of untold riches and adventure, however, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, pushing the boundaries of known space, as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of black holes.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to the human spirit's relentless pursuit of exploration, even across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
