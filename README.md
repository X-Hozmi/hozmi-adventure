
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a jostling mass of pack animals and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, pushes us onward, our determination fueled by rumors and a thirst for the unknown.  The path is fraught with peril, but the potential reward makes every hardship worthwhile.


A thousand years hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the silent expanse.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Andromeda Galaxy, evading the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, is a daily gamble. The quest for the lost colony of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, demands courage and skill beyond measure. But the discovery of a new civilization, a new technology – that is the ultimate reward for a spacefarer in the far future.
