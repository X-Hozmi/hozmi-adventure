
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a poor comfort against the gnawing fear in her heart.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a legend whispered in hushed tones around crackling fires.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged King – demanded she brave its murky depths, encountering bandits, monstrous beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation, all for a sliver of hope in a world teetering on the brink of chaos.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll, a ruthless mercenary fleet, pushed her crew to their limits.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by a desperate hope that the treasures – and the answers – of Xylos were worth the unimaginable risks they faced.
