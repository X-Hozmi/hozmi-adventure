
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies and a heart heavier still with the weight of her quest.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, lure her onward, past snarling wolves and suspicious villagers, her only companions the biting wind and the setting sun painting the jagged peaks in fiery hues. Each creak of her saddle, each stumble of her weary horse, is a testament to the unforgiving nature of her journey, a journey that could lead to unimaginable riches or a swift and brutal end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport are a breathtaking, terrifying spectacle as she charts a course to Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold scientific discoveries and the potential for first contact.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the subtle shifts in gravity, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields are the constants of her interstellar voyage, a journey demanding precision, courage, and a healthy dose of luck against the vast, unpredictable canvas of space.
