
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky, a daunting barrier on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient secrets fueled my resolve, pushing me further into the unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  My gaze fell upon the swirling nebula outside our viewport, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of colour and cosmic dust.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region teeming with uncatalogued planets and potentially hostile alien lifeforms. The risks were immense, the distances unimaginable, but the potential rewards – the discovery of new resources, new worlds – eclipsed the fear.  The vastness of space, once a terrifying void, had become my playground, a testament to humanity's relentless thirst for exploration.
