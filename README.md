
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a battle against the biting wind.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky. My quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging my village.  Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the undead haunted these desolate paths.  Survival was a daily struggle, but the hope of salvation fueled my weary bones.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet promising untold riches in rare minerals and the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos glittered outside the viewport, a tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, a breathtaking spectacle that did little to mask the constant threat of pirate raids and unpredictable wormhole disturbances.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the lure of Xylos's treasures, and the advancement of humankind, kept us hurtling onwards.
