
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s battered warhorse stumbled onward, the relentless sun beating down on their journey across the unforgiving steppe.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in the shadows of crumbling ruins, treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, pushed him onward, a beacon in the vast, indifferent landscape.  His loyal squire, Thomas, lagged behind, his face etched with weariness, but the glint of adventure still burned in both their eyes.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been rough, but the promise of uncharted planets and alien civilizations far outweighed the risk.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned explorers, monitored the ship's systems, their faces illuminated by the swirling cosmic dust outside.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas of infinite possibilities – and potential dangers –  awaiting their exploration.
