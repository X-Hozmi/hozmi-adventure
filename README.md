
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant kingdom.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked in the shadows.  The journey was arduous, a test of both endurance and spirit, but the thought of her people fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: the Kepler-186f system, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with fluctuating wormhole currents was commonplace, yet the breathtaking cosmic vistas constantly reminded her of the vastness and wonder of the universe.  The challenges were different, the dangers perhaps more subtle, but the spirit of adventure – the thrill of pushing boundaries and exploring the unknown – burned just as fiercely within her as it did in Elara, her medieval counterpart.
