
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a few coins, and a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward, a solitary adventurer against the backdrop of a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course plotted for the uncharted galaxy of Andromeda.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, silent expanse of space.  His crew, a ragtag band of explorers and mercenaries, awaited the discovery of new worlds, the potential for unimaginable riches, and the ever-present danger of hostile alien lifeforms and malfunctioning warp cores.  The universe was their playground, a limitless expanse of adventure, risk, and untold possibilities.
