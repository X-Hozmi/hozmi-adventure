
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre landscape in hues of blood orange and fading gold.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both rider and beast, and the relentless desert sun tested the limits of human endurance.  Yet, the glint of the unknown, the promise of discovery, fuelled her onward, a stubborn ember against the vast, indifferent expanse.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the far-flung K'tharr system.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony was commonplace; the real challenge was the psychic storms that wracked the interstellar currents.  Every jump was a gamble, every hyperspace transit a dance with oblivion, but the allure of the K'tharr's legendary artifact – a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – outweighed the risks. The vastness of space was terrifying, but the chance to reshape galactic history was too intoxicating to resist.
