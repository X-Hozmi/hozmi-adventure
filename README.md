
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the scent of pine and impending rain heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, a testament to countless journeys, guided her through treacherous mountain passes and across whispering plains.  Each village offered a new tale, a different dialect, a glimpse into the diverse tapestry of a world barely charted.  Danger lurked in the shadows – bandit raids, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the lure of the unknown, the promise of distant lands and untold riches, fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory spacefaring creatures of the Cygnus Arm was a constant challenge, each jump a gamble.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, were bound together by shared ambition and the intoxicating allure of the cosmos. The vastness of space offered unparalleled wonders, but also the stark reality of the unforgiving void and the ever-present risk of getting hopelessly, irrevocably lost.
