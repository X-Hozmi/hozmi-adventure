
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Aquitaine in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Whispering Mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of Ys, and the whispered promises of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled his weary body and unwavering spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was taxing, warping space and time around them, but the potential discovery of surviving colonists—and the secrets they might hold—outweighed the risks.  The vastness of the cosmos offered breathtaking beauty, but also terrifying unknowns; the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and hostile alien lifeforms adding to the complexity of interstellar travel.
