
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor clanking, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had stretched for months.  They'd skirted bandit-infested forests, forded treacherous rivers swollen with spring rains, and endured the scornful stares of suspicious villagers. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a crumbling bridge, a sudden storm, or the ever-present threat of illness – but Gareth pressed on, driven by faith and a yearning for the unknown that lay beyond the next horizon.  The tapestry of the medieval world, vibrant and dangerous, unfurled before him with every league traveled.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the distant colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic courier.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and unimaginable distances, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for disaster, but the reward – the chance to contribute to the survival of humanity's far-flung settlements – fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination safely.
