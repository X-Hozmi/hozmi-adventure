
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary beasts, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each night brings the chilling howl of wolves, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the flickering campfire.  We’re not just traversing miles; we're braving bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and enduring the ever-present threat of starvation and disease – all for a whispered promise of untold riches and a city lost to time.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a lullaby against the backdrop of a star-strewn void.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-like planet light-years from our solar system.  The journey is measured not in days or weeks, but in subjective time stretched thin across the expanse of space.  The thrill is not just the exploration of the unknown, but the mastery of technology that allows for such audacious voyages.  The dangers are less tangible – rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but no less perilous for their abstract nature.
