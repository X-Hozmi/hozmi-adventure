
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  Dust swirled around their small caravan, a precarious procession of pack animals laden with silks and spices, heading east towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits were a constant threat, the terrain unforgiving, and the rumours of monstrous beasts lurking in the untamed forests fueled the fear that gnawed at the edges of their courage.  Yet, the promise of untold riches, of exotic lands and breathtaking wonders, spurred them ever onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet of Aethel.  The journey was fraught with peril - asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who roamed the black expanse between stars. But the lure of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of Aethel's ancient civilization, and the potential to revolutionize interstellar travel, outweighed any risk.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held a promise as alluring as any medieval legend.
