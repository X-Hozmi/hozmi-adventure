
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery of St. Jude, had already tested their endurance.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless rhythm of hoofbeats on hard earth, the gnawing hunger in their bellies, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts lurking in the shadows of ancient forests. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, a testament to the raw, unforgiving beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, but also harboring unknown dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic scavengers that plagued interstellar trade routes was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vast expanse of space, both magnificent and terrifying, held the ultimate reward and the ultimate risk, a stark contrast to the grounded challenges of the medieval era yet equally filled with thrilling uncertainty.
