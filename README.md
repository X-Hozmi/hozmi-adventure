
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the rutted track, her gaze fixed on the distant, snow-capped peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  This journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery nestled within their treacherous crags, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, the rivers are swollen with spring melt, and the whispers of mythical beasts echo through the lonely valleys.  But the promise of healing for her ailing brother fuels her onward, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of determination to conquer the unforgiving landscape.

A thousand years hence, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Wanderer', its sleek hull slicing through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the swirling nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields is a daily challenge,  the hum of the warp drive a constant lullaby against the vast, silent expanse.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilisation swallowed by the cosmic currents.  The odds are stacked against her, the journey a test of both skill and courage, but the hope of rediscovering a lost people burns brighter than any distant sun.
