
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Pyrenees mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed passes, and the rocky trails tested both horse and rider to their limits.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – a ford to cross, a village to barter with, the ever-present threat of wild animals. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, pushed her onward, fuelled by a thirst for adventure and the hope of unimaginable riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational pulls and unpredictable asteroid fields; a single miscalculation could mean the difference between reaching the Kepler-186f colony and becoming another speck of dust in the vast cosmic expanse.  But the thrill of charting unmapped sectors, the potential discovery of new life forms, and the unwavering camaraderie of her crew surpassed the inherent dangers. The universe was a vast and unforgiving ocean, yet Eva, like Elara before her, was driven by an insatiable need to explore its boundless depths.
