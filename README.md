
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rode, the relentless sun beating down on his mail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, scorching deserts where mirages danced mockingly, and unforgiving forests teeming with wild beasts.  His meager supplies dwindled, his companions fell ill, but the whispered tales of Zerzura's healing waters spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering unknown space anomalies was routine; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the whispers of a predatory alien species said to stalk the nebula's edges. The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling nebulas and distant galaxies, both mesmerized and terrified her, yet the hope of finding survivors fueled her journey.
