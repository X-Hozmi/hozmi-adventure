
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the relentless sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glimmer of hope, the whispered tales of Zerzura's healing waters, pushed her onward, forging her into a woman of iron will.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate signal their only clue.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were child's play compared to the psychic storms that threatened to tear her ship apart. But Ryla, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, held firm, driven by the faint hope of finding survivors and bringing them home.  The vastness of space offered little comfort, but the possibility of rescue fueled her relentless journey.
