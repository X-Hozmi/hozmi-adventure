
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the roads were treacherous, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to every village they passed.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – a ford to cross, a hostile lord to appease, a dwindling supply of rations to stretch.  Yet, with every hardship, their resolve hardened, fueled by faith and the unwavering hope of reaching their destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Raiders, a fearsome spacefaring species, tested her skills and the limits of her ship.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space presented its own unique dangers, from cosmic radiation to engine failures, but the lure of discovery, and the potential to unlock interstellar travel, propelled her forward.
