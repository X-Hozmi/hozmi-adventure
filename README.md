
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to swallow whole caravans without a trace.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – felt more perilous with each creak of the wagon wheels, the rustling of unseen things in the overgrown hedges a constant reminder of the unknown dangers lurking beyond the familiar.  The promise of gold barely outweighed the fear gripping her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of colours and cosmic dust.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for colonisation. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was also profoundly isolating.  The hum of the ship’s engines was her only companion amidst the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of a universe brimming with possibilities, but also with unseen threats—asteroids, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of warp storms.
