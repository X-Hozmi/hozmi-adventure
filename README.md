
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death chilled her more than the autumn air. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat, a constant reminder of the vulnerability of a lone traveler in a time of upheaval.  Yet, the vastness of the land, the sheer determination in her heart, fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away.  The journey wasn't just about distance; navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps presented constant challenges.  The vast expanse of the galaxy, breathtaking in its beauty, was also a terrifying wilderness, a testament to the boundless risks and immense rewards of interstellar travel.
