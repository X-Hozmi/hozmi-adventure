
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on their dust-caked armor and worn cloaks.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Mountains, rumored to harbor both untold riches and monstrous beasts.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent shivers down their spines, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness.  Their quest: a lost city, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Survival, let alone success, was far from guaranteed.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were their highway.  Captain Eva Rostova, her seasoned face etched with the lines of a thousand jumps, gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery at the edge of the known galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory cruisers of the Kryll Empire, they pushed their ship to its limits, relying on instinct, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.  The riches of Xylos were less tangible – knowledge, perhaps, or the discovery of a new, powerful energy source – but the risk, just as in the medieval age, was undeniably real.
