
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Midlands had been brutal; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, propelled him forward.  Each creak of his saddle, each gasp of his horse, was a beat in the drum of his grand adventure, a testament to the courage and perseverance required to traverse a world both beautiful and unforgiving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potential but desperately lacking in breathable atmosphere.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a breathtaking leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  While the dangers were less tangible than bandits and disease, the cosmic unknown held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life. But Eva, a seasoned explorer, welcomed the challenge, for the boundless expanse of space offered an adventure unlike any other.
