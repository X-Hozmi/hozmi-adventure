
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onwards.  The midday sun beat down on the parched landscape of the Rhône valley, the scent of rosemary and thyme doing little to mask the ever-present stench of unwashed bodies and dying livestock.  Her quest: to reach Avignon and plead with the Pope for her village, ravaged by plague and famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each stumble of the mule, was a reminder of the immense distance and the perilous journey still ahead, filled with the constant threat of bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been successful, but the challenges were far from over.  Navigating the alien ecosystem, establishing contact with any potential sentient life, and securing the vital resources needed to sustain her crew on their long journey back to Earth were just the beginning.  The vast emptiness of space, while beautiful, held its own terrors – unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, entities.
