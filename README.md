
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones across the taverns of Constantinople, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience, but the lure of the lost oasis and the secrets it held fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate raids across intergalactic space, Ryla's journey demanded precision and courage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held wonders and dangers in equal measure, a stark contrast to the earthy challenges faced by her medieval ancestor.
