Her journey across the breadth of France was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swollen, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in her quest to reach her estranged brother in the far north, a desperate gamble for reunion against the odds of a brutal and unforgiving landscape.

Across the vast, inky blackness of space, the emerald jewel of a planet beckoned, a promise of untold riches and scientific discoveries.  But the galaxy held dangers far beyond bandits and disease.  Pirate fleets patrolled the star lanes, rogue asteroids posed constant threats, and the unknown horrors of alien lifeforms lurked in the unexplored corners of space, making each hyperspace jump a roll of the cosmic dice.
