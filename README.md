
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical Isle of Avalon, rumored to hold a healing balm for his plague-stricken village.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, dense forests teeming with wolves, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the swirling nebula of Xylos, its hyperdrive humming a lullaby of interstellar travel. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden, catastrophic solar flare.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true peril lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Yet, the promise of finding survivors, of reuniting families scattered across the vastness of the galaxy, spurred her onward, a beacon in the endless black.
