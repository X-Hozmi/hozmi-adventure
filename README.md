
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of pack animals and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  The air hangs heavy with the scent of dust and sweat, a stark contrast to the tales whispered around crackling campfires at night – tales of mythical beasts guarding hidden valleys, and treacherous mountain passes where the wind howls like a banshee.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge: navigating treacherous rivers, bartering with suspicious villagers, and constantly watching for bandits who lurk in the shadows of ancient ruins.  Our destination, the fabled city of Zerzura, remains a shimmering mirage on the horizon, a testament to the enduring allure of the unknown.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we jump between star systems, the swirling nebulae a breathtaking, ever-changing backdrop.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a galaxy far, far away.  Each jump carries a risk - unpredictable gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding life beyond our own, fuels our journey, pushing us onward through the inky blackness towards the unknown wonders of the cosmos.
