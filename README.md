
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all hazards on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aerthos.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in his quest for fortune and glory.  The trail stretched before him, a ribbon of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth and teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The galaxy was their arena, and the vast emptiness between stars both a challenge and a canvas for their daring exploits.
