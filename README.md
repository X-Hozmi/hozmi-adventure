
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagons, each strained breath of our horses, spoke of the arduous journey ahead.  We sought the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches,  a perilous quest fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. The whispered tales of Eldoria fueled our determination, despite the looming shadows of uncertainty.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The crimson nebula of Xylos burned behind us as our starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to chart unexplored systems and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast distances, the unpredictable wormhole jumps, and the potential encounters with unknown alien lifeforms presented challenges far exceeding any medieval journey, yet the promise of a new dawn for humanity spurred us onward, across unimaginable gulfs of space.
