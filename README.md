
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke a weak counterpoint to the ever-present threat of bandits.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and tear-repaired edges, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine – a thrilling mix of fear and anticipation fueled by the vast, unknown wilderness ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the 'Stardust Wanderer,' the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy a breathtaking spectacle outside her viewport. Her journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was far removed from Elara's, but the thrill of the unknown remained constant.  The vast expanse of space, speckled with distant stars and the ever-present hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of danger – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the threat of pirates, and the sheer loneliness of traversing unimaginable distances.
