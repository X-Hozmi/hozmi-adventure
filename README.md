
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the blighted lands, spurred her on. Each creak of saddle leather, each gasp for breath in the thin mountain air, fueled her desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, possibly hostile, life.  The jump to hyperspace had been harrowing, the navigation through asteroid fields a constant test of skill, but the potential scientific breakthroughs outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her as she charted a course toward the unknown, a pioneer in the relentless human quest to conquer the cosmos.
