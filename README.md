
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains in hues of blood orange.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a battle against sunstroke, bandits, and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  Rumours of monstrous beasts and treacherous terrain filled the nights around crackling campfires, whispered amongst weary travellers bound by a shared purpose – to reach Jerusalem before winter's grip tightened its icy claws.  The rough track offered little comfort, yet each sunrise promised a new vista, a new challenge, and a step closer to her ultimate goal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the sentient planet Kepler-186f before the K'tharr Empire could claim it.  The jump to hyperspace was a violent lurch, a sensory overload of light and sound before the serene, endless black of deep space enveloped them.  Across light years, she navigated asteroid fields, dodged pirate raids, and outsmarted bureaucratic delays on the way to this vital mission. The reward: potentially saving billions of lives, if she could just reach her destination on time.
