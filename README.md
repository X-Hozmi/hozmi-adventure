
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and questionable herbs, jostled against her back.  This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the whispers of plague haunted every village. Yet, with each crest of a hill revealing a breathtaking panorama, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring need for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon steered his starship *Seraph* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with shimmering stars and silent cosmic dust, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  His mission, a search for new resources and habitable worlds, was a gamble, a leap into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.  The risks were immense – asteroid fields, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of engine failure – but the promise of discovery fueled his unwavering determination.
