
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel contained not gold, but seeds – precious seeds for a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the whisper of hope, the promise of a better future, spurred her onward through treacherous passes and across unforgiving rivers. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, flung across galaxies by a catastrophic warp-jump malfunction generations ago.  The journey was a tapestry of unimaginable distances, perilous asteroid fields, and encounters with alien species both benevolent and hostile.  But the lure of rediscovering a lost heritage, a piece of humanity’s forgotten past, drove him across the vast emptiness, each hyperspace jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
