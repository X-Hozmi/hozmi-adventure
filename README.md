
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – a fear born not of bandits, but of the unknown lands beyond the King's borders.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mixture of trepidation and fierce determination, the landscape itself a living tapestry of danger and breathtaking beauty.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet potentially harbouring life.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking panorama of celestial bodies outside her viewport. While the dangers were less tangible – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions – the sense of isolation and the vastness of the cosmos pressed upon her just as heavily as the wilderness had upon Thomas.  The thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovery, outweighed any fear.
