
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping at her worn cloak.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Woods, legendary home to bandits and worse.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the King in the far north, was a perilous undertaking, fraught with the dangers of wild beasts, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of human malice. Each day brought a new challenge – navigating swollen rivers, bartering for supplies in suspicious villages, and always, the gnawing uncertainty of her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps presented constant threats.  But Jax, hardened by years traversing the galaxy, faced each challenge with steely resolve, her focus unwavering on the success of her mission, and the knowledge that countless lives depended on her safe return.
