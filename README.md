
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, inched across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, the gnawing anxiety of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of disease. Yet, with each dusty mile, the allure of Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones of exotic spices and unimaginable wealth, propelled us onward.  The rough-hewn map, more a hopeful suggestion than a precise guide, was our only companion against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of exploration and powered by a technology barely understood, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint whispers of quasars and the ghostly shimmer of nebulae, our crew charted unmapped territories, encountering alien landscapes and civilizations beyond our wildest imagining.  The risk of encountering hostile species, encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies, or the catastrophic failure of the hyperdrive, were constant companions, yet the boundless wonder of the cosmos far outweighed the peril.
