
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her worn map, a testament to countless tears and sweat-stained creases, guided her ever onward, towards the legendary city of Eldoria and the rumored cure for her brother's illness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the hope of finding salvation fueled her onward, each day a perilous gamble against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Nova' Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his course charted towards the unmapped galaxy of Andromeda.  The thrill of discovery, the promise of alien civilizations and untold wonders, outweighed the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes.  His crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known planets, shared his thirst for the unknown, their faces lit by the ethereal glow of distant suns as they ventured into the vast, unexplored expanse of the cosmos.
