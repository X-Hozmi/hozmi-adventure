
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  This journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic, has been fraught with peril. Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation have tested her resilience. Yet, the glint of the setting sun on the distant horizon fuels her hope, promising a reward beyond the hardships endured.  Each step is a gamble, a testament to the unwavering human spirit that dares to face the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the dangers remain: rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who prowl the interstellar lanes. This voyage to the Kepler-186f system, a potential new colony, is not merely a journey through space; it's a leap of faith into the future of humanity, a testament to our relentless curiosity and our unwavering quest to explore the vast, unforgiving, and endlessly wondrous universe.
