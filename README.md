
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Ys's rumored gold towers, seen only in fleeting dreams, fuels his relentless journey across the blistered earth, a testament to the unwavering bonds of familial love.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, her course charted for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the shimmering tapestry of distant nebulae, is a far cry from the medieval knight's struggles.  Yet, the spirit of adventure remains the same – a thirst for the unknown, a willingness to confront unimaginable odds.  Warp drives hum, alien landscapes beckon, and the potential for discovery, both breathtaking and terrifying, fills every moment of Eva's interstellar voyage.
