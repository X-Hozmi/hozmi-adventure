
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease.  But the glint of the distant mountains, promising a path towards hope, fueled her weary steps forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable anomalies of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  But the breathtaking panorama of a million stars, each a potential destination, fuelled her determination to reach her destination, bringing life to a dying world.
