
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s chainmail as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in fiery hues.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Brittany, was fraught with peril.  Bandit warlords lurked in the shadowed forests, and the very air seemed thick with the threat of disease and famine. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him; this journey was a constant, heart-pounding gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of light against the unimaginable vastness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, scattered across a dozen uncharted planets.  The hyperspace jump was a jarring, disorienting experience, but the thrill of traversing light-years in moments far outweighed the discomfort.  Each planet presented a unique and potentially lethal challenge – toxic atmospheres, alien predators, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning technology – a far cry from the dangers faced by medieval travelers, yet equally perilous in their own right.
