
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, pressed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant rumble of thunder. His quest – to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland – pushed him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and past the suspicious glares of bandits lurking in shadowed forests. Each sunrise brought new challenges, a constant test of endurance and courage in a world teeming with both beauty and brutal danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a tapestry woven with the hum of warp drives and the crackle of subspace comms, was punctuated by asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the vast expanse of space held a different kind of allure, a thrilling uncertainty that fueled her ambition to explore the uncharted territories of the galaxy, seeking new life and new civilizations.
