
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course charted by a centuries-old map hinting at a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became commonplace in his perilous journey.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, each star a potential destination, each jump through hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of reality.  The treasure at the end of his voyage?  Not gold, but the knowledge of a civilization long thought extinct, and the secrets they held.
