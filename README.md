
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the lonely nights.  Yet, the lure of the East, of silks and spices, of tales spun in bustling bazaars, spurred her onward, a lone woman carving her own path across a continent brimming with both wonder and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped through hyperspace, leaving the familiar spiral of the Milky Way behind.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, rumored to contain planets teeming with exotic lifeforms and untold resources.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of K'tharr pirates, Ryla and her crew faced challenges far beyond those of any medieval traveler.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with nebulae and the glittering dust of a million suns, held the promise of discovery, but also the terrifying unknown – a frontier where the line between adventure and oblivion blurred.
