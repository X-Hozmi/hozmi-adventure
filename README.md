
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, each sunrise promising a new challenge, a new vista, a new step closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Corvus steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were routine, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the potential encounters with hostile alien species kept the adrenaline flowing.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the camaraderie of his crew fuelled his spirit, making every galactic voyage an exhilarating gamble against the odds.
