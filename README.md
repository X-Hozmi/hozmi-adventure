
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had become a desperate scramble for survival.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the relentless heat threatened to break them before they reached their destination.  Each creak of their worn saddles, each labored breath, was a testament to the perils and uncertainties inherent in medieval travel; a gamble against the elements, the lawless, and the unpredictable whims of fortune.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the galaxy-spanning hyperspace network from a remote, uncharted planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic K'tharr pirates, Elara faced dangers far beyond those of any medieval knight.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery in the vast expanse of the cosmos, fueled her resolve, making the risk a worthwhile price to pay for the advancement of her civilization.
