
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Yet, with each sunrise, the knight's resolve strengthened, fueled by the promise of spiritual cleansing and the thrill of the unknown that lay ahead, across mountains and through valleys, towards the distant spires of the cathedral.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*. The vastness of space held a different kind of danger; the unpredictable jumps through hyperspace, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the allure of new worlds, teeming with alien life and untold riches, spurred her onwards.  Each jump was a leap of faith, a gamble on the unknown, a testament to human ambition stretching beyond the confines of a single planet, reaching for the boundless horizons of the galaxy.
