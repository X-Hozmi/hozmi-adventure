
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship and unexpected kindness.  She'd traded stories with grizzled mercenaries, bartered for bread in bustling market towns, and navigated treacherous mountain passes where wolves howled under a star-studded sky.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a new memory etched into the adventure unfolding before her.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Sparks' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the emerald jewel of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to recover a lost artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was treacherous, fraught with asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of space-time.  She relied on her crew's diverse skills – a xenolinguist to decipher ancient alien warnings, a seasoned engineer to repair warp-drive malfunctions, and a grizzled navigator to chart a course through unmapped regions of space. The vast emptiness of space held the same alluring danger and promise of discovery as any medieval road.
