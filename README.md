
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just supplies; it holds the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands of the south to escape the encroaching famine.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant howl of a wolf, is a reminder of the perilous adventure she's undertaken, a testament to the courage needed to navigate a medieval world where survival is a daily challenge.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, a planet promising life but fraught with unknown dangers.  His crew, a motley bunch united by the thirst for discovery, face not wild animals or famished peasants, but the unpredictable nature of space itself – asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life. Their galactic journey represents humanity's boldest leap, a testament to our unyielding desire to explore the vastness of the universe.
