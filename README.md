
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a battle against the biting wind.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky.  My quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation were my constant companions, but the whispers of Eldoria's healing magic, and the desperate hope in the eyes of my dying countrymen, fueled my relentless journey eastward.  Each sunrise was a victory, each sunset a prayer.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport painted a canvas of cosmic beauty, a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the ship's interior. My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on a planet beyond known charts.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unknown alien lifeforms were commonplace hazards; the vastness of space itself a relentless and unforgiving opponent.  But the thought of finding my ancestors, the echo of their forgotten history, kept me focused on the endless expanse before us.
