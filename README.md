
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age,  showing the treacherous route to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on his quest for the legendary Sunstone, a journey fueled by whispered tales and a desperate hope for fortune.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each sunrise over barren hills, marked another step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The mission, a search for habitable worlds, was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, propelled her and her crew ever onwards.
