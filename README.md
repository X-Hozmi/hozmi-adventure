
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, a tapestry of sun-baked earth and parched fields. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague that ravages his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends, spur him onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous journey across the Andromeda galaxy, a search for a new habitable world for humanity's dwindling population.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and encounters with alien lifeforms are commonplace hazards.  The vast distances, the loneliness of interstellar space, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction test her resolve, but the promise of a new beginning, a future beyond Earth's dying sun, fuels her relentless pursuit of a distant hope.
