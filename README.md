
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting reminder of the unforgiving landscape. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and personal notations, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness, felt both impossibly distant and desperately crucial.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Vast, swirling colors painted the viewport as her ship jumped between star systems, the familiar hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  Her mission, to deliver vital data across the Andromeda galaxy, was far less romantic than the legends of old, yet held a similar urgency. The fate of countless worlds rested on her shoulders, the weight of responsibility a heavier burden than any mountain pass or bandit ambush.
