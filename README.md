
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, fueling the fierce determination burning within her to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  The adventure was perilous, but the reward potentially life-saving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to a struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of system failures were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic freighter captain. The vast expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a testament to the unpredictable nature of interplanetary travel and the courage required to explore the galaxy’s farthest reaches.
