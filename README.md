
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  Her journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and desperation, was a constant test of endurance, a race against time and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the horizon, making the already arduous path seem even more endless.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues painted a breathtaking canvas across the viewport, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Though the dangers were different – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly in Nova's heart as it had in Elara's, a testament to the enduring human desire to explore the uncharted territories of the cosmos, or simply, to reach a distant goal.
