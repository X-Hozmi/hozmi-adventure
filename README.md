
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the unforgiving desert threatened to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brought the chilling awareness of her vulnerability, but the allure of the unknown pushed her relentlessly forward, spurred on by whispers of magic and the hope of a life beyond the hardship of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the sterile metal of his cockpit.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of genetically-engineered crops to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Comet, a seasoned veteran of countless interstellar voyages, felt a familiar thrill of exhilaration; the frontier beckoned, and the rewards, both tangible and intangible, were worth the calculated risks.
