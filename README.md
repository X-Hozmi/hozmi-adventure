
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He’d left the familiar comfort of his village months ago, spurred by whispers of a lost city shimmering with gold beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the lure of the unknown fueled his weary limbs, a potent elixir stronger than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere, a colossal structure capable of harnessing the energy of a star, hidden somewhere within the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks and breathtaking vistas, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.  But for Eva, the thrill of exploration, the tantalizing possibility of discovering something no human had ever seen, outweighed any peril.
