
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He'd left the familiar comfort of his village weeks ago, a single-minded determination burning brighter than the midday sun. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  Each sunrise brought the challenge of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the whispered tales of Zerzura fueled his spirit, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the land.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes steered her starship *Stardust* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation systems.  Her mission: to locate and secure the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  The journey was fraught with peril; uncharted space, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failures made each hyperspace jump a gamble. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of connecting with a lost piece of humanity, propelled Elara and her crew across the unimaginable distances between the stars.
