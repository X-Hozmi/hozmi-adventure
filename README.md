
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – seeds of a new life, a new harvest for the ravaged village she'd left behind.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of the Black Death followed her like a phantom, but the promise of a bountiful future spurred her onward. Each day was a gamble against starvation, disease, and the unpredictable nature of the medieval world, a thrilling, terrifying adventure forged in necessity and hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Eva relied on her wits, the ship's aging technology, and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vastness of space held dangers far beyond those Elara had faced, yet the lure of discovery and the potential for a better future for all humankind fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances between stars.
