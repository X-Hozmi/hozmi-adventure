
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any Saracen.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a desperate search for meager shelter, but the unwavering faith in his quest pushed him ever closer to Jerusalem.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the challenges were no less daunting.  Warp storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, pirate fleets lurked in the shadows of uncharted systems, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies tested the limits of her crew's endurance.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, fueled her journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
