
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds a tattered map, promising a legendary lost city rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, fuels a mixture of fear and excitement.  Bandits, disease, and the sheer brutality of the wilderness are constant threats, but the allure of adventure, the whispered tales of the city's magic, spurs her onward, across treacherous mountain passes and through shadowed forests, towards an unknown destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust', leaping across the vast gulf between galaxies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet teeming with possibilities – or perils.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar comfort as she navigates through asteroid fields and nebulae,  facing the ever-present threat of space pirates and the unknown dangers of alien ecosystems. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach into the cosmos, far outweighs the risk.  The galaxy awaits, a breathtaking tapestry of wonders and dangers ready to be explored.
