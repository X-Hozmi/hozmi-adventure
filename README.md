
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Each creak of our packhorses, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Our quest – to deliver a sacred relic to a distant abbey – demanded unwavering resolve, pushing us through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked plains, a journey measured not in miles, but in the gnawing hunger, the chilling nights, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, our sleek starship, cut a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its navigation systems charting a course across uncharted galaxies.  The thrill wasn't just the breathtaking cosmic vistas, but the calculated risks:  navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate fleets, and the constant hum of anticipation for what new wonders, or terrors, each jump through hyperspace would reveal.  The universe, our canvas; the journey, a lifetime's adventure.
