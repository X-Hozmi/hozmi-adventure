
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead, the treacherous Spine of the World mountains loomed, their jagged peaks promising hardship and peril.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the mountain spirits, said to claim those who dared trespass.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula, its engines a low hum against the cosmic silence.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, promising a new energy source crucial to humanity's survival.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the patrols of the Kryll Empire were just the beginning.  The true adventure lay in the unknown – the alien landscapes, the potential for discovery, and the ever-present threat of the uncharted depths of space.
