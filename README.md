
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to their resilience.  Eldoria remained a shimmering mirage, but the spirit of adventure, fueled by hope and a desperate need, spurred them ever onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate cruisers were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, however, was the true adversary – the crushing loneliness, the constant threat of equipment failure, and the sheer unknowable scale of the cosmos weighed heavily on the crew.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to uncover a lost civilization, and the unwavering belief in their mission fueled their interstellar voyage.
