
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the scorching desert tested her endurance at every turn.  Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, but each sunset amplified the looming threat of starvation and exhaustion.  The whispers of Zerzura, of its rumored healing waters and untold riches, fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, its iridescent hues a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-drive failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers was a daily struggle, but the hope of finding the colonists, of reuniting them with their families, kept her engines humming and her spirit strong.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the immense risk, and the potentially immeasurable reward.
