
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – seeds meant to revive the ravaged fields of her village.  Her journey is fraught with peril: bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers run swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's determination burns brighter, fueled by the hope of a bountiful harvest and the whispered legends of a mystical valley said to hold the key to restoring their land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that will take years, even decades.  The vastness of space holds its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, navigates the cosmos with unwavering skill, guided by the faint signal emanating from the colony's last distress beacon and the unwavering belief that she will bring them home.
