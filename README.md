
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy lanes of Oxford, a  scholar's satchel slung across my shoulder, filled not with texts but with dried meats and maps hastily drawn on parchment.  The King's highway beckoned, a ribbon of dust and peril winding through the heart of England and beyond.  Each sunrise brought new challenges –  bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every league traversed, a sense of exhilaration grew, fueled by the whispered tales of distant lands and the promise of untold adventures.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My ship, the *Starseeker*, leaps across the void between galaxies, a pinprick of light against an unimaginable canvas of nebulae and dying suns.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The risks are different now – cosmic radiation, navigational hazards in uncharted space, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, both friendly and hostile.  But the thirst for discovery, the human drive to explore the unknown, burns just as brightly as it did in those medieval days.
