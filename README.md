
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the grey sky, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each flash of lightning on the horizon, heightened the danger and mystery of his journey.  He traveled through dense forests, treacherous mountain passes, and across rivers swollen with spring melt, constantly battling the elements and the occasional band of highwaymen.  His hope, as fragile as a newborn babe, was his only compass.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown lifeforms and guarded by formidable alien sentinels.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet each jump through hyperspace carried its own risk –  navigational errors could lead to the crushing gravity of a black hole, or a collision with an uncharted asteroid field.  The vast emptiness of space held both exhilarating freedom and terrifying isolation, a stark contrast to the perilous journeys of her medieval predecessors.
