
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a snaking line of weary oxen and even wearier men, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Rumors of bandits, scorching deserts, and monstrous beasts plague our journey, but the lure of Zerzura's fabled riches and untold wonders keeps us pushing onward, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel. We navigate by the stars, our only guides through the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship sleek as a predator, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant nebulae, inspires awe and a chilling sense of isolation.  We face dangers far removed from bandits – solar flares, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of alien environments. But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to plant the seeds of our civilization amidst the wonders of another world, fuels our intrepid journey across the cosmic sea.
