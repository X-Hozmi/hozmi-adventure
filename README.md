
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Elara's small caravan trudged onward, the creak of wagon wheels a constant companion to the rhythmic thud of hooves.  Their journey, a perilous pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, had already claimed a mule and two men to the harsh realities of the desert. Yet, the whispers of hidden oases and the promise of untold riches spurred them on, each sunrise a gamble against starvation, bandits, and the unforgiving elements.  Every rocky outcrop held a potential ambush, every dune a mirage teasing survival itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, rumored to hold a lost colony.  The thrill of discovery warred with the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel, the vast, inky blackness punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the comforting hum of the ship's engines.  Each jump through hyperspace was a dice roll against cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed upon lone explorers, their shadowed vessels lurking in the blackest corners of space.
