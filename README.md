
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with rain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes, the thrill of the unknown, and the camaraderie of fellow travellers who shared their meager rations and stories of their own perilous quests. The simple act of traversing the land, of witnessing the vastness of the world, was its own reward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony light-years from Earth.  The journey, a blur of hyperspace jumps and painstaking navigation through asteroid fields, was a constant test of skill and courage. The vast emptiness of space, while beautiful, was also terrifyingly lonely, the silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of comms.  But the knowledge that she was pushing the boundaries of human exploration, bringing hope to a new world, fueled her relentless pursuit across the galaxy.
