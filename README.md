
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Brigid, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across unforgiving plains, and into the shadowy heart of a bandit-infested forest.  Each sunrise brought new challenges:  dodging patrols of unfriendly lords, bartering for supplies in ramshackle villages, and navigating by the cryptic guidance of a tattered map.  The weight of his mission, and the miles traveled, pressed down on him as heavily as his chainmail.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission, far more ambitious than any medieval knight's, was to locate a lost colony on the edge of known space.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views – swirling gas giants, asteroid fields glittering like scattered diamonds, and the ethereal beauty of distant galaxies – but also presented perilous encounters with space pirates, rogue gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions light years from any friendly port. The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, a far cry from the camaraderie found in medieval taverns.
