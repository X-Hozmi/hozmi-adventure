
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and thyme battling the ever-present stench of sweat and dried mud.  Her journey to the fabled city of Damascus was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the relentless heat threatened to break her spirit as much as her meager supplies.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching a welcoming village, but each sunset found her further from home, her resolve tested by the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her cockpit.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Eva faced challenges far removed from the medieval adventurer's struggles, yet the inherent human drive for discovery remained the same – a relentless pursuit of the unknown, a gamble against the odds for a glimpse of something magnificent.
