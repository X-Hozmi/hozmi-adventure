
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald’s warhorse as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and impending rain clinging to the air.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurs him onward, a lone knight against the vast, indifferent tapestry of the medieval world.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive as it leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way. Captain Eva Rostova, a grizzled veteran of a thousand star-faring expeditions, stares out at the swirling nebulae, each a testament to the infinite wonders and terrifying unknowns of the cosmos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, its fate shrouded in mystery. The challenges are not of bandits or blizzards, but of treacherous wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of fuel depletion light-years from civilization. Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of finding those lost souls, makes the risks worthwhile.
