
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and drying herbs a poor substitute for the sea she yearned for.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to be amongst the mercenary companies warring in the far east.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary mile, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease – a high price for the whispered promise of reunion.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, masking the thrill of charting unexplored nebulae and encountering alien civilizations.  Their mission: to locate a legendary artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – but the potential reward of unlocking interstellar travel for all of humanity spurred them onward.
