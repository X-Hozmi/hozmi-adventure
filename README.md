
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that pricked my nostrils as we skirted the edge of the Black Forest.  Rumors of brigands and worse haunted every shadowed glen, but the promise of the merchant city of Cologne, and the silks it held, spurred us onward, a small band of travelers united by a common thirst for fortune and a healthy dose of recklessness.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting drone against the infinite black.  Across the viewport, the swirling nebula of the Cygnus X-1 system painted a breathtaking panorama, a stark reminder of the insignificance of our tiny vessel against the vastness of the cosmos.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors beyond the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The risks were unimaginable, the distances incomprehensible, but the potential rewards – a future for humanity – made the journey a necessary gamble.
