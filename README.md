
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, the scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar spices clinging to the air.  Ahead lay the long, perilous road to Constantinople, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new landscape – rolling hills giving way to dark forests, then vast, sun-baked plains – each a chapter in a story etched in sweat, blisters, and the unwavering hope of reaching my destination.  The whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten kingdoms only fueled my adventurous spirit.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Instead of dirt roads, I navigated asteroid fields; instead of bandits, I faced the unpredictable whims of alien life forms.  The swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy were a sight beyond imagining, their colours shifting and coalescing like a cosmic painter's dream.  Each jump to a new star system held the thrill of discovery, the promise of new worlds, new challenges, and the stark reality of the vast, uncharted expanse of space. The adventure was grander, the stakes infinitely higher.
