
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, the last vestiges of civilization before the vast, untamed forests of Bohemia.  Ahead lay a journey fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the whispered tales of the lost city of Eldoria, a place brimming with ancient magic and untold riches, fueled my relentless westward trek.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes and the potential for both breathtaking discovery and terrifying encounters.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Cygnus Arm, dodging space pirates and contending with unpredictable wormholes, was a far cry from the dangers of medieval travel, but the thrill remained.  The cosmos, an ocean of stars and swirling nebulae, held both unimaginable beauty and existential threats, making every jump to hyperspace a gamble, and every new planet a thrilling unknown.
