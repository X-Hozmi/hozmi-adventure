A lone figure, cloaked in leather and steel, rode a sturdy destrier, their eyes scanning the horizon for signs of danger. The medieval era was a time of rugged adventure, where travel across land was a perilous journey fraught with banditry, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of war.

The journey across galaxies could take generations, but the thrill of exploring the unknown, the possibility of discovering new civilizations and unraveling the secrets of the universe, was a powerful allure.
