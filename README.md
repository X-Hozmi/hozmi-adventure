
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I trudged across the snow-covered Alps. My quest: to reach the fabled city of Seraphina, whispered to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged my village.  Each mountain pass was a gamble, each valley a potential ambush by bandits or worse – the howling wolves that stalked the shadowed forests.  The journey tested my strength, my resolve, and pushed me to the very edge of endurance, but the hope of salvation fueled my weary steps.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, studded with glittering nebulae and menacing asteroid fields, held a different kind of terror than the wolves of the Alps.  Navigating treacherous wormholes and evading the predatory K’tharr warships demanded a different kind of bravery, one born of technology and calculated risk, but the allure of discovery – of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge – propelled me forward just as surely as hope had done in the medieval world.
