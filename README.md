
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains of Castilla a fiery red.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the relentless sun threatened dehydration.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for both wonder and hardship, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel across the vast, unforgiving land.  Her destination felt a lifetime away, yet each step brought her closer to the sanctuary she sought.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, inky blackness peppered with distant suns.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates – the sense of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained a constant companion. The universe, a boundless ocean of stars, held untold riches and unimaginable terrors, all awaiting exploration by those brave enough to reach for them.
