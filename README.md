
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salt spray stinging our faces as we set sail for the mythical city of Samarkand.  Months bled into one another, marked by the rhythmic creak of the ship, the endless expanse of the sea, and the occasional fearsome storm that threatened to swallow us whole.  We braved treacherous mountain passes, bartered with suspicious merchants in dusty marketplaces, and slept under the vast, star-dusted sky, always pushing eastward, towards the silks, spices, and legends of the Orient.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new encounter, a new story etched onto the tapestry of our adventure.

A thousand years hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  My crew and I, aboard the 'Stardust Drifter,' navigate the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, charting unexplored systems and seeking out habitable worlds. Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the universe still holds its mysteries: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  Our mission is exploration, charting new frontiers in the vast emptiness, a journey as perilous and exhilarating as any undertaken by medieval knights, only with vastly different landscapes and considerably more advanced technology.
