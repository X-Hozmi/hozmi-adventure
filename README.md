
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets – a prize worth risking bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to overtake him and his small band of companions.  Each creak of saddle leather and clang of their meager armor echoed the perilous adventure unfolding before them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and maintaining the ship's fragile life support system were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying dangers, a constant reminder of the immense gamble they were taking in their quest for a new home amongst the stars.
