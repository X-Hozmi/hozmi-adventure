
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  This journey, to find the mythical city of Ys, is fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and the treacherous mountain passes are guarded by whispers of mythical beasts.  Yet, the allure of the lost city, the promise of untold riches and knowledge, fuels her onward, each creak of her saddle a drumbeat to a destiny unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the rumored Dyson sphere orbiting Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts are useless in the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, and the dangers are cosmic in scale: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on lone travelers.  But the lure of unlocking galactic travel is a siren song that even the vastness of space cannot silence.
