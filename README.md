
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind whipping at her cloak.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort against the looming peaks and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the unforgiving wilderness and the perilous journey ahead to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  Her quest, a desperate search for a lost cure, fueled her onward, pushing her past exhaustion and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes that spat them out across uncharted territories.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, worked tirelessly, their faces illuminated by the flickering console lights. The mission: to locate a mythical nebula rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space held both incredible wonder and unimaginable peril, a constant test of courage and skill.
