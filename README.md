
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his small retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking deep with each step.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and nights spent huddled around meager fires under a sky ablaze with stars.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, but also the gnawing fear that Zerzura was but a myth, a cruel mirage in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes demanded unwavering skill and nerve.  The crew, a band of seasoned explorers, faced isolation, mechanical failures, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the hope of finding their lost brethren, propelled them forward, across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
