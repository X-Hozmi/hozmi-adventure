
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched landscape, their mounts weary and thin.  The quest for the mythical Sunstone had led them far from the familiar comfort of their kingdom, into the untamed wilds where bandits lurked in crumbling castles and whispers of sorcery hung heavy on the wind.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the Sunstone, and the glory it promised, burned brighter in their hearts.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by sentient flora.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the opportunistic pirates who plagued the intergalactic trade routes required every ounce of her skill and courage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the challenges faced on medieval roads, yet the thrill of discovery – the unknown landscapes, the potential for both unimaginable riches and catastrophic failure – was a constant companion, as ancient as the human spirit itself.
