
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort amidst the looming uncertainty of his journey. He carried a king's pardon, a forged letter of safe passage, and a heart brimming with both fear and desperate hope.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter,' her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport pulsed with impossible colors, a breathtaking backdrop to the immense void of space. Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of unknown celestial phenomena, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  The weight of her crew's lives, and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries, rested on her shoulders.
