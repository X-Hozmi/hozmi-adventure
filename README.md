
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as her weary horse picks its way across the parched Breton countryside.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear hangs heavy in the air – whispers of the Black Death precede her.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to her estranged brother, a knight rumored to be fighting with the English.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat in this unforgiving land, a landscape as treacherous as the political landscape she traverses.  Her journey is a gamble with fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate a lost colony ship, swallowed by the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  The vastness of the cosmos presses in on him, a breathtaking and terrifying canvas of celestial wonders and hidden dangers.  Navigation charts are useless against the unpredictable distortions of space, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders makes every jump a high-stakes gamble.  The rewards are untold riches, lost technologies, and the chance to etch his name into the annals of galactic exploration, but the price of failure could be the loss of his crew, and his life.
