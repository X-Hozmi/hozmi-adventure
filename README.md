
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, rocky path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried rations; it contained the secrets of a lost monastery, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure and peril. Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements were constant companions on this perilous journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  Her destination, a whispered legend, promised glory or ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet orbiting a binary star system light years from the Sol system.  The journey wasn't just about space; it was about navigating political intrigue and alien hostility.  Faster-than-light travel masked a constant threat from pirates, rival corporations, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  The galaxy was a vast and dangerous frontier, but the potential rewards—for Rexx and humanity—were equally immense.
