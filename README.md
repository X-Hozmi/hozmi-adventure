
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, a quest for both fortune and knowledge, had already taken him through sun-baked deserts and treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the unnerving silence of vast, uncharted plains.  Yet, the allure of the East, with its whispered tales of unimaginable riches and ancient wisdom, spurred him onward, each hardship only strengthening his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were routine challenges; the true peril lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  With each jump, the ship risked being lost in the chaotic currents of the cosmos, a fate worse than any terrestrial peril. But the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of the galaxy – was a siren call Eva couldn't ignore.
