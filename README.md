
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a perilous route across the splintered kingdoms of Francia.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit patrols, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were but a few of the trials he faced in his desperate journey, his courage fueled by familial love and the whispered promise of ancient wonders.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away, battling a relentless sandstorm and beset by dwindling resources.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll raiders, Elara relied on her wits and the cutting-edge technology of her starship to overcome the vast distances and perilous unknowns of interstellar travel.  The fate of a whole colony rested on her shoulders, a burden matched only by the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos surrounding her.
