
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The map, stained and torn, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains, a fabled city of gold lost to time.  His journey had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of that promised gold, the whisper of legend, kept him moving, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, seeking habitable planets for the burgeoning interstellar colony.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien worlds, fueled her insatiable thirst for discovery.
