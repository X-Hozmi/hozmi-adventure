
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey across the vast, untamed plains of Aquitaine was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowy forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the lonely nights.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, her courage, and the strength of the ancient map clutched tightly in her calloused hand, a guide to a rumored lost city of unimaginable wealth and power.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships preying on vulnerable transports.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding new life and resources, fueled her unwavering resolve.  The cosmos was a relentless, unforgiving mistress, but Eva, like countless explorers before her, was prepared to risk everything for the chance to chart the unknown.
