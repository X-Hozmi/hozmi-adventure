
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood he'd smelled only hours before, a reminder of the bandits they'd evaded.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, felt more desperate with each passing mile, the vastness of the unknown countryside stretching before him like a daunting ocean. Each sunrise revealed a new challenge - treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of highwaymen.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust a stark contrast to the sterile white of her control panel.  Her mission: to retrieve the Xylossian artifact, vital to the intergalactic peace treaty.  The jump to the next system was a risky one, the Xylossian storms legendary for their destructive power, but the stakes were too high to turn back.  Across the light-years, billions of lives hung in the balance, each star a potential hazard, each planet a gamble, on this voyage to the far reaches of the cosmos.
