
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a frantic scrawl promising riches and glory, burned a hole in his saddlebag.  Ahead lay the treacherous Blackwood Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a stark reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay between him and the fabled city of Eldoria. He pressed on, driven by ambition and the faint hope of survival.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The jump through hyperspace had been harrowing, the ship bucking and groaning under the strain.  Now, as the emerald planet materialized before them, the weight of responsibility pressed down – the lives of her crew, the fate of a new civilization rested on her shoulders. This was but one leg of a far longer journey, a galactic odyssey to chart the unknown and secure humanity's future among the stars.
