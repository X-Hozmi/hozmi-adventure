
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every league traversed, the tales whispered around crackling campfires grow more alluring, fueling our determination to reach the legendary city and claim our piece of its riches, or perhaps, simply to survive another day.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaps across the void between galaxies, charting a course through nebulae painted across the cosmos.  The thrill isn't in avoiding bandits, but navigating asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  The riches aren't gold or silks, but the knowledge gleaned from alien worlds, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored planets, and the camaraderie forged under the shared wonder of the infinite universe.
