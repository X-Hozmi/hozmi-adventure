
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were my constant companions, but the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, pushed me onward, each step a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving elements. The map, a tattered scroll acquired from a grizzled old cartographer, was my only guide, its cryptic markings as elusive as the city itself.

Centuries hence, the sleek crimson hull of the *Starseeker* sliced through the iridescent nebula, its destination Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging rogue plasma bursts was child's play for Captain Eva Rostova, her veteran crew a silent testament to countless interstellar voyages.  The mission was to explore, to discover, to plant a flag on a new world—a legacy for a species whose insatiable curiosity pushed them beyond the confines of their dying sun.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered both terrifying beauty and thrilling uncertainty, a frontier every bit as challenging, and ultimately more rewarding, than any medieval quest.
