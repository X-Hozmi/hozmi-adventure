
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing hunger that stalked him relentlessly.  But the lure of the unknown, the possibility of finding more than just survival, fueled his onward journey, a solitary speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unexplored planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth.  But the thought of finding the lost colonists, of bearing witness to the wonders (or horrors) of uncharted space, spurred her onward.  The vastness of the cosmos offered unparalleled adventure, a constant dance between technological prowess and the unpredictable mysteries of the universe.
