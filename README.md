
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous rivers needed fording, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory, but the lure of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, fueled her onward.  She carried with her not just a worn map and a meager supply of dried meat, but the unwavering hope of finding something more than survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous currents of the cosmic sea was a vastly different kind of adventure, demanding precise calculations and unwavering nerve.  The thrill wasn't just in the unknown landscapes of distant planets, but in the sheer audacity of traversing the impossible distances between star systems, facing unpredictable nebulae and the constant threat of system malfunctions.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking grandeur and terrifying uncertainty of the cosmos.
