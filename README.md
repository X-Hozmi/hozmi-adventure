
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the setting sun.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, sent shivers down their spines –  bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The lure of Eldoria, however, fueled their weary bodies and emboldened their hearts.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey*, a silver needle piercing the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate habitable planets for humanity’s expanding colonies.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a mystery waiting to be unveiled,  a breathtaking yet terrifying adventure across the vast and wondrous cosmos.
