
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests a hill, the spires of a distant city shimmering in the afternoon sun.  Her journey from the western coast has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing threat of starvation. But the promise of finding her lost brother, rumored to be apprenticed to a renowned blacksmith in this far-flung city, fuels her onward.  Each aching muscle, each scraped knee, is a testament to the adventure she’s embracing, a tapestry woven with grit, determination, and the unwavering hope of reunion.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years. The vast emptiness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  the hum of the ship's engines a constant companion against the silent, star-dusted void.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the thought of the colonists relying on her cargo pushes Eva onward, making her own small mark on the grand, galactic tapestry of exploration.
