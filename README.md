His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the key to ending a devastating plague.

Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.

Yet, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos and the weight of her responsibility to countless colonists spurred her forward, transforming the perilous journey into a testament to human ambition and resilience.
