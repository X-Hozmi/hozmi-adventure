
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest – to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother – had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the bustling, often hostile, heartlands of foreign kingdoms.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous rivers, bartering for food and shelter, and constantly dodging the suspicious gaze of those who saw a lone woman traveler as an easy target.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey charting new habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space presented its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction.  But unlike Elara, Eva had the backing of a powerful federation and advanced technology. Still, the loneliness of interstellar travel, the weight of responsibility, and the awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos, all served as constant companions in her grand, perilous adventure.
