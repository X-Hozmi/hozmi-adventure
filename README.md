
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to be embroiled in the Hundred Years' War. Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog, each passing knight, represented both a potential threat and a glimmer of information in her desperate quest across a war-torn continent.  The road was long, fraught with danger, but the thought of her brother spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylossian freighter dwarfed by the swirling cosmic canvas.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from their home in the Andromeda galaxy. The journey was fraught with its own perils – asteroid fields, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure. Yet, the allure of discovering a new world, of charting the unknown reaches of the universe, fuelled the crew's determination as they plunged deeper into the star-strewn void.
