
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resilience.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and evading the suspicious gazes of those who saw them as outsiders.  Their adventure was not one of glory, but of grit and determination, a slow, arduous crawl across a vast and unforgiving land.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Eva and her crew faced the perils of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields the size of small planets, and the unpredictable whims of wormholes. Their adventure was a race against time, a testament to human ingenuity and courage, propelled not by horses and hope but by ion drives and unwavering ambition, across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
