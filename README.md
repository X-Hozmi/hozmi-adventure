
Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a forest primeval, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and pine.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and arcane secrets. Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but minor inconveniences in his dogged pursuit of glory and fortune, a journey fuelled by ambition and a thirst for the unknown.

Faster-than-light travel brought its own dangers – spatial anomalies, temporal distortions, and the sheer loneliness of traversing the vast emptiness between worlds.  Yet, Elara pressed on, driven by a duty to her people and a profound fascination with the cosmos.
