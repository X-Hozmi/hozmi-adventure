
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain a test of endurance, and the whispering rumours of mythical creatures kept her on edge. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of discovery, spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of new landscapes and untold adventures.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a path through the nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the gravitational pull of distant suns was child's play compared to the political minefield of the Galactic Federation.  Her mission: to secure a rare energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  The journey promised not only untold riches but the potential discovery of sentient life, a gamble that, despite its inherent dangers, fueled her adventurous spirit and ignited a thirst for the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
