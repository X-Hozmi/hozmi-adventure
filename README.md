
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chausses as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both danger and discovery as she navigated treacherous passes and untamed wilderness, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the grasping tendrils of sentient nebulae, she relied on her crew's expertise and her own unwavering instinct. The vast, unexplored cosmos offered breathtaking beauty and unimaginable peril in equal measure, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of Earth, but the lure of the unknown propelled her forward, fueled by the hope of a groundbreaking discovery.
