
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's shimmering spires and healing waters spurred her onward, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the legendary planet of Aethel, said to possess a life-sustaining mineral vital to the survival of her people.  Hyperdrive jumps punctuated the vast emptiness, each one a gamble against unforeseen celestial phenomena and pirate attacks.  But the promise of Aethel, a world bathed in emerald light, fueled her determination across the unimaginable distances of interstellar space.
