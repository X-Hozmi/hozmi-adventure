
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  This journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing shrine nestled in the Dragon's Tooth mountains, is fraught with peril.  Bandit raids are commonplace, the unforgiving terrain tests her strength daily, and whispers of mythical creatures haunting the shadowed valleys keep her constantly vigilant.  Yet, the unwavering hope of healing her ailing brother fuels her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unpredictable alien lifeforms and treacherous gravitational anomalies.  Faster-than-light travel is routine, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of space pirates make each jump a gamble.  The rewards, however, are immense – the data core holds the key to unlocking a new era of interstellar travel, a future reliant on her courage and skill.
