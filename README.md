
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his courage, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria spurred him on, each sunrise a renewed testament to his unwavering hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a cosmic anomaly decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Yet, the potential discovery of a lost civilization, a chance to rewrite history, fueled their determination, making every jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
