
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a perilous commission to deliver a vital message across the war-torn countryside. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, rival knights, or the ever-present threat of disease.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a constant gamble against the elements and the malevolence of man.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system was risky, the wormhole unstable, but the promise of the legendary Xylos crystals, potent energy sources capable of powering entire galaxies, was too tempting to resist.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely expanse punctuated by the hum of the engines and the occasional crackle of static from distant comms.  The true adventure lay not just in reaching Kepler-186f, but in surviving the treacherous political landscape awaiting them on the other side.
