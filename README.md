
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as our caravan lumbered across the parched plains, the midday sun beating down on our meager supplies.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a testament to our journey's hardship, a constant reminder of the bandits lurking in the shadows and the unpredictable whims of nature.  We sought the legendary city of Zerzura, a whispered myth promising untold riches and a king's ransom in spices.  Every sunset brought the gnawing fear of the night, every sunrise the renewed hope of reaching our elusive goal.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive was a far cry from the groan of wagon wheels.  Our starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a swathe through the inky blackness, the nebulae outside swirling like cosmic paint strokes.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a secret coveted by empires across a thousand galaxies. The risks were different now –  uncharted wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the thrill of the unknown, the insatiable human hunger for discovery, burned just as brightly.
