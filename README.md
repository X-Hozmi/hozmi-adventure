In the medieval era, an adventure across land was a formidable undertaking, fraught with peril and demanding immense courage. Travelers, be they merchants seeking new markets, pilgrims journeying to sacred sites, or knights on quests, faced untamed wilderness, treacherous mountain passes, and dense, bandit-infested forests. Weeks could stretch into months, each day bringing the threat of encountering wild beasts, outlaws, or succumbing to disease and the elements, with little more than a horse, a map (if any), and one's wits as companions on journeys that often started with no guarantee of return.

Yet, beyond the dangers lay the irresistible pull of the unknown. Every horizon promised a new discovery: a bustling foreign city with exotic wares, a remote monastery clinging to a cliff face, or a kingdom with customs entirely alien. The sheer act of perseverance, of crossing vast, untamed lands, forged a deep sense of resilience and gave birth to legendary tales. To undertake such a journey was to truly live, to witness a world far grander and more diverse than one's village, and to return forever changed by the epic journey.
