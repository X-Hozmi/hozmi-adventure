
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking step was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements.  The map, a faded parchment clutched in her calloused hand, was her only guide through the unforgiving wilderness, a lifeline in a world where survival was a daily battle.  She pushed on, fueled by a sibling's love and the faint whisper of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for hyperspace jumps.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic messages left behind by the colonists, messages that hinted at a far greater danger than any hostile force. The vast expanse of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of annihilation.
