
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the cryptic map promising untold riches in a forgotten monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees mountains.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the trials she faced on this perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and its unseen dangers. The allure of adventure, however, far outweighed the fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and dealing with malfunctioning hyperdrives were all part of a typical interstellar voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held endless possibilities and equally endless risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown, but for Eva, the quest for discovery was a siren's call too powerful to resist.
