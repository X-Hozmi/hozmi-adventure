
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the allure of the legendary City of Gold, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred her onward.  The journey was perilous, a tapestry woven with scorching heat, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the promise of untold riches, and perhaps even glory, kept her spirit alight.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the warring factions of the Galactic Federation. The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the chasm of mistrust between worlds;  Ryla's mission, a desperate search for a new home, was a gamble against the odds, a voyage fueled by the hope of survival and a future free from the dying embers of Earth.
