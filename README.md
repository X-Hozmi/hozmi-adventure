
The creaking of the wagon wheels was a constant companion, a rhythmic counterpoint to the wind whistling across the vast, empty plains.  Days bled into weeks as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions journeyed eastward, their destination a legendary city whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold said to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation in the barren landscapes. But the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and glory, spurred them onward, their courage tested with every mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the ancient, cryptic maps of the long-vanished Xylan civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, far removed from the simpler dangers of Kaelan's era.  Yet, the yearning for discovery remained the same.  The vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy, teeming with strange new worlds and potentially hostile alien races, held a similar allure, a siren song of adventure beckoning her forward into the unknown.
