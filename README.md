
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, barely legible after months of travel, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day is a battle against hunger, bandits, and the unforgiving landscape, yet the glimmer of hope fuels her onward.  She relies on the kindness of strangers, the sharp eye of her loyal hound, and her own unwavering determination to reach her destination before it's too late.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with perilous asteroid fields and unknown alien encounters.  Advanced technology aids her, but the vastness of space and the unpredictable nature of the cosmos still present a formidable challenge. The weight of responsibility for her crew and the hope of finding survivors rests heavily on her shoulders, propelling her across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
