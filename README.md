
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, whispered tales of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The journey was arduous, testing her strength and resolve, but the unwavering fire in her heart burned brighter than the setting sun.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmare of intergalactic customs.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the Xylos system, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril from hostile alien species and malfunctioning warp drives.  The vastness of space held both wonder and danger, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
