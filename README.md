
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a constant companion on this perilous journey across the French countryside.  His quest: to find the lost monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the obstacles standing between him and his goal, each day a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less fraught with danger.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirates – both human and alien – kept her crew on edge.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of the galaxy.
