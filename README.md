
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseilles, the salty tang of the Mediterranean still clinging to our clothes as we traded the sea for the uncertain trails inland.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked its way across the sun-baked Provençal plains, then into the shadow of the Alps.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in mountain passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, with each milestone, the thrill of discovery burned brighter than any fear. The whispered legends of faraway lands fuelled our resolve, pushing us onward despite the hardship.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The shimmering nebula of the Andromeda Galaxy spread before us as our starship, the *Starseeker*, hurtled through the void.  Our mission: to chart unmapped sectors, to study alien worlds bathed in the light of distant suns.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril – rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, extraterrestrial life.  Yet, propelled by human curiosity and the burning desire to explore the ultimate frontier, we pressed on, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking unknown.
