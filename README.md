
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs fills the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray of the coast she left behind.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril: bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispers of plague follow her like a vengeful spirit.  Each sunrise brings the promise of a new hardship, yet also the thrilling uncertainty of what lies ahead – a chance encounter, a hidden valley, or perhaps, a life-altering discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaps across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and encountering unknown celestial phenomena is commonplace;  the true adventure lies not just in the vast distances, but in the human drama unfolding amidst the stars – the bonds forged under pressure, the sacrifices made, and the ever-present uncertainty of whether they will ever return to their home galaxy.
