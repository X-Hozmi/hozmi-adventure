The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through a treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks threatening to claw at the sky.  He’d journeyed for weeks, his quest a desperate search for the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing Queen.

The ultimate prize, the survival of a forgotten people, fueled her unwavering resolve.
