
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, their future hinging on reaching the fabled silk markets of the East.  Bandits lurked in shadowy forests, and the relentless sun threatened dehydration, but the allure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, each rocky mile a testament to her courage and resilience.  She dreamt of spices and silks, a far cry from the meager existence she knew.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ryle navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal dangers.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of celestial wonders, but the journey was fraught with asteroid fields and unpredictable space anomalies.  The stakes were high; the fate of the Galactic Federation rested on his shoulders, a burden he carried with the steely resolve of a seasoned spacefarer.
