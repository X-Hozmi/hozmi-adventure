
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and the weight of her secret mission.  Bandit whispers haunted the wind, and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains promised more hardship than respite.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the scrub, heightened the thrill of her journey, a clandestine pilgrimage to deliver a vital message that could sway the fate of kingdoms. The unpredictable nature of the terrain and the constant threat of violence made every step an adventure, a gamble with fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a feat considered suicidal by most. The ship bucked and shuddered against the unpredictable gravitational forces, the starlight outside a dizzying kaleidoscope of colors.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval quest, yet the same thrill of discovery, the same exhilarating risk, echoed in Eva's heart – the intrepid spirit of exploration transcending time itself.
