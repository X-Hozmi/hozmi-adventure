
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the worn amulet her grandmother had given her.  Rumors of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient knowledge, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger.  Each creaking cart wheel, each distant hawk cry, hinted at the adventure – and the peril – that lay ahead in the untamed heart of France.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids across multiple galaxies was commonplace, but the lure of unlocking the universe’s secrets far outweighed the risks. The vast, glittering cosmos, both beautiful and deadly, offered an adventure far beyond the wildest medieval dreams.
