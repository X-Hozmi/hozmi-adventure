
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping in the wind, spurred his mare onward.  The map, crudely drawn on parchment, promised riches beyond imagining – a lost city nestled amongst the treacherous peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown pushed him further, each sunrise a new gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of ancient magic that clung to the wind.  The journey was a test of endurance, a dance with fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glow of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a different kind of wilderness.  The dangers were less tangible – radiation bursts, asteroid fields, the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life – but no less perilous.  Eva’s journey, a quest for a new home for humanity, represented a breathtaking leap into the unknown, a testament to human ambition and resilience.
