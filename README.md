
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm clinging to the air.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for bandit ambushes or unforeseen hardship.  But the promise of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of her imagination, fueled her onward, a testament to the unwavering courage of medieval travelers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of asteroid fields, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp core instability.  Navigating by the constellations of a distant galaxy, she felt a kinship with those medieval adventurers, driven by a purpose larger than themselves, facing dangers both known and unknown in the pursuit of a greater good.
