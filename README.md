
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing a lost monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and gnawing hunger were constant companions, yet the thrill of the unknown, the whispers of legend, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new step closer to the heart of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Aethel, a world known for its unpredictable gravitational fields and hostile, sentient flora.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with celestial wonders and dangers, was a constant reminder of the scale of his undertaking.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, leaving him suspended between the thrill of discovery and the ever-present shadow of the unknown.
