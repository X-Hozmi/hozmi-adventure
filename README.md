
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before them. Their journey to the Sultan's court had been arduous, fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous river crossings, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and evading the watchful eyes of rival lords. Yet, the allure of the Sultan's legendary lost city, whispered about in hushed tones throughout the land, fueled their relentless advance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across the unmapped expanse between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The jump had been harrowing, the ship buffeted by gravitational tides that threatened to tear it apart.  Ahead lay the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap. But the void was unforgiving, and the whispers of pirate fleets and rogue AI entities loomed larger than any earthly threat.  Survival, let alone success, demanded unwavering courage and a touch of reckless daring.
