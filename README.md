
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat and a chipped map, her only companions the echoing silence of the mountains and the persistent gnawing fear of bandits. This journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was a gamble, a desperate attempt to find a cure for her ailing brother, a quest that tested her courage and resilience with every treacherous pass and hidden valley.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vastness of space held a different kind of terror – the silent, black expanse punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the occasional rogue asteroid field.  Her mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of terraforming algae to Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of colonization.  The journey was perilous, the risks unimaginable, but the promise of a new life for a dying world fueled her unwavering determination.
