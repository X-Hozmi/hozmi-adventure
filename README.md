
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold both unimaginable wealth and perilous magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges that lay between her and her quest to find a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Through asteroid fields teeming with pirates and navigating treacherous wormholes that threatened to tear his vessel apart, Rexx pressed onward, fueled by the hope of finding a civilization lost to time and the thrill of charting the unmapped expanse of the galaxy. The vastness of space held both the promise of discovery and the chilling reality of utter annihilation.
