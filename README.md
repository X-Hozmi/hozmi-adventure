
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to be haunted by bog beasts and worse.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, demanded he brave the unknown, dodging bandits, navigating treacherous terrain, and relying on the kindness – or fear – of strangers in isolated villages.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the chilling uncertainty of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict research station orbiting Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the ever-present threat of solar flares was all in a day's work.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover secrets lost to time and distance, fueled her journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy, a modern-day knight errant in a cosmos filled with wonder and peril.
