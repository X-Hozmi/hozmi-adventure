
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He’d traded his meager harvest for a place on this caravan heading east, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold silks finer than moonlight and spices that could cure any ailment.  Bandits, disease, and the endless, unforgiving landscape were constant threats, yet the lure of the unknown, of riches and stories to be told, burned brighter than any fear. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new chance to etch his name onto the map of the world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and perilous alien life.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the thrill of exploration remained the same.  Each jump through the hyperspace gate was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown dangers lurking between galaxies, but the promise of discovery and the advancement of humankind fuelled her journey across the vast cosmic ocean.
