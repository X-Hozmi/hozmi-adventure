
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a half-eaten loaf.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of the plague still clung to the wind. Her journey to the fabled monastery of Saint-Gilles was fraught with peril, but the promise of healing for her ailing brother spurred her onward, a determined glint in her eye amidst the vast, unforgiving landscape.  She had faced down angry dogs, outsmarted greedy merchants, and even slept under a sky ablaze with the Northern Lights.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from Earth.  The treacherous jump through hyperspace had tested her crew's nerves, and the alien flora of Kepler-186f presented its own unique challenges – sentient, carnivorous vines and crystalline storms being just two. But Eva, a veteran explorer with a steely gaze and a heart full of daring, knew that the galaxy's greatest treasures were always guarded by the most formidable obstacles.
