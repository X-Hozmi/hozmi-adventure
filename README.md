
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in smuggled spices, the promise of a new life in the far-off city of Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of exotic lands and untold riches, spurred her onward, a tiny figure silhouetted against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the swirling colours of distant galaxies, presented a different kind of danger – unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of the universe, propelled her forward, a lone explorer charting a course into the unknown.
