The dusty track, barely a path through the unforgiving highlands, stretched before him, promising both peril and untold riches.  Whispers of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fuelled his journey, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in his belly.
