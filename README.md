
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the open plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, guides her mule westward.  Ahead lies the treacherous Whisperwind Pass, rumored to be haunted by bandits and worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fuels a mixture of fear and fierce determination, a perfect cocktail for a medieval adventure. The journey is fraught with danger, but the promise of discovery keeps her pushing onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne pilots the starship *Stardust* across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion as she navigates treacherous asteroid fields and charts unmapped nebulae.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  With a crew of diverse specialists and a ship brimming with advanced technology, Nova faces challenges far beyond any medieval knight, yet the spirit of adventure burns just as brightly, fueled by the vast unknown that awaits them amongst the stars.
