
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, propelled her onward.  The whispered promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge fueled her weary body and sparked a fire in her adventurous soul, a burning desire to overcome the seemingly endless expanse of land separating her from her goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and contending with unpredictable warp storms was commonplace, but the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new life forms and charting unmapped territories across the galaxy, superseded any fear.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, filled her with awe, a profound sense of insignificance juxtaposed against the immense scale of the universe and the boundless possibilities it held.
