
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of whether legend or delusion fuels his desperate journey.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages offers fleeting comfort, a reminder of the life he risks everything to save.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the inky blackness towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Nebulae swirl around her vessel like cosmic brushstrokes, while the hum of the hyperdrive fills the bridge with a low thrum.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating; each jump to hyperspace a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The survival of humanity rests on her shoulders, a burden as heavy as the stars themselves.
