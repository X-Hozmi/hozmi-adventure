
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, her pack laden with herbs and the weight of her family's hopes.  Each creaking step of her mount was a gamble against the crumbling paths, the lurking bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The promised riches of the Silk Road felt a lifetime away, a shimmering mirage in the harsh, sun-baked landscape. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the challenge of overcoming each obstacle, fuelled her onward.  This journey, fraught with peril, was her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes, Ryla and her crew searched for the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vastness of space, a humbling, beautiful terror, was their constant companion.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each alien encounter a potential alliance or deadly threat.  But the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, burned brighter than any fear.
