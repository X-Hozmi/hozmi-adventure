
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Her worn leather satchel holds a tattered map, her only guide to the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, holds the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harsh realities of a world without easy passage.  She presses on, driven by hope and fueled by the meagre rations in her bag, a true adventurer in a time of hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space is both breathtaking and terrifying; asteroid fields pose constant threats, and the unknown lurks within uncharted sectors.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer, pushes forward, driven by the quest for new life, new knowledge, and the thrill of discovery in a universe brimming with endless possibilities.  The cosmos are her playground, a boundless expanse of adventure waiting to be charted.
