His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold the lost scroll of King Arthur.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrill of the unknown. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were minor inconveniences in the face of such a glorious objective.  The journey was the reward, a tapestry woven from hardship and breathtaking beauty.


A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of space pirates was child's play compared to the scientific discoveries awaiting her crew. The vast expanse of space, a canvas of unimaginable colours and celestial wonders, both terrified and inspired them.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble with time and distance, but the potential rewards – uncovering new life, expanding human knowledge – were infinitely greater than the risks.
