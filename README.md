
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of Eldoria and the hope for his sister's recovery spurred him onward, his spirit as rugged and resilient as the landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unknown celestial bodies was commonplace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own brand of danger, from rogue energy storms to the potential threat of alien encounters. But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed on, driven by the faint hope of finding survivors and the enduring human spirit of exploration.
