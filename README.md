
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows that danced with the whispers of bandits rumored to lurk in the nearby Black Forest. Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom—a priceless illuminated manuscript destined for the Abbey of Saint Jude—and with it, the weight of a perilous journey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay ahead: treacherous mountain passes, marauding brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The road to salvation, it seemed, was paved with fear and grit.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the asteroid field, his starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of the Andromeda galaxy.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap, had been harrowing.  Now, his crew faced the daunting task of landing on a planet with an unknown atmosphere and potentially hostile lifeforms.  The thrill of exploration warred with the chilling reality of their isolation, light years away from any rescue.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of untold wonders—and potentially, the end of their journey.
