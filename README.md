
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, drives him onward, spurred by tales of brave knights and glorious deeds.  He knows the road ahead is long and perilous, but the legendary city beckons.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  Advanced technology cushions the hardships, but the vastness of space holds its own terrors – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Eva and her crew face cosmic storms and navigate asteroid fields, their courage fueled by the hope of finding survivors and forging new alliances amongst the stars. The galaxy is their canvas, and exploration, their destiny.
