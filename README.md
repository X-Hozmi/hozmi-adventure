
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a scrabbling collection of pack animals and weary travellers, crested the pass. Below, a vast, sun-drenched valley opened, promising both bounty and peril.  Each sunrise brought the whispered threat of bandits, the gnawing anxiety of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown that lay beyond the next mountain range.  Yet, with every league conquered, the allure of distant lands and the whispered legends of forgotten cities spurred us onward, driven by the insatiable human thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cut through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated by the shimmering trails of nebulae, her crew a motley blend of xeno-biologists and seasoned spacers.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Arm of Xylos, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense - rogue asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of warp core failure – but the potential rewards, the unlocking of unimaginable technologies and new worlds, were far too tempting to resist.
