
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for banditry, or worse – the dreaded Black Death.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of San Juan de la Peña, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother, pushed her onward despite the gnawing fear and the endless, unforgiving landscape. The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the enduring human spirit in a time of both peril and profound faith.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily routine, punctuated by the breathtaking spectacle of alien landscapes visible through the viewport.  The weight of the universe pressed upon her, a counterpoint to the thrill of charting the unknown.  Each jump into hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, terrifying, and ultimately alluring expanse of the cosmos.
