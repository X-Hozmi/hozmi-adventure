
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she spurred her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of Francia a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Abbey of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart, fueled by sibling love, propelled her ever closer to her uncertain destination, a testament to the unwavering human spirit against the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across light-years of unpredictable space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of her own fragility. Yet, the promise of scientific breakthrough, the potential to cure a galaxy-wide famine, spurred her onward, a modern-day odyssey propelled not by horseflesh, but the relentless power of humankind's insatiable curiosity.
