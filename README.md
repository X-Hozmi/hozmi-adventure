
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne stretching before her.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map promising a lost monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, felt a weight as immense as the journey itself.  Each creak of her saddle, each cautious step of her weary horse, echoed the perilous uncertainty that clung to her like the clinging dust. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this desperate quest across the war-torn land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black of interstellar space.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey, spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the unpredictable whims of alien space-faring creatures, was far from simple.  Yet, the potential rewards – unlocking unimaginable possibilities for humanity’s expansion across the galaxy – fuelled her and her crew, driving them forward through the immense, beautiful, and terrifying unknown.
