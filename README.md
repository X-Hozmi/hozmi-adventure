
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the unwavering hope of Eldoria spurred them across rivers swollen with spring melt and through sun-baked deserts, their resolve tested with every mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the planet Kepler-186f, light years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unseen planets, Eva relied on her instincts and cutting-edge technology to chart a course through the uncharted cosmos.  The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of peril than the medieval wilds, but the loneliness and the constant hum of the ship's engines were as isolating and demanding as any medieval journey, pushing her to the very edge of human endurance.
