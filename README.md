
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of disease clinging to the crowded towns they'd passed.  His quest – to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Avignon – was a perilous journey across a fractured kingdom, beset by bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the quiet relief of a hard-won night’s rest under a sky thick with stars.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, the vast emptiness of space a stark and beautiful backdrop to her mission.  Though the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vast unknown beckoned, promising both peril and the thrill of discovery.
