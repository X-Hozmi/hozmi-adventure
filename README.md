
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unknown terrors whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires.  His journey was a gamble with life itself, a testament to the courage needed to face the unpredictable hazards of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a daily challenge.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own set of dangers;  radiation storms, engine malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of undiscovered alien lifeforms.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach across the cosmos, spurred her onward, a testament to the indomitable human spirit's quest to explore the uncharted.
