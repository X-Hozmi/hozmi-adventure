
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones by travelling merchants – a city said to hold unimaginable riches and arcane knowledge.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles in her path, a tapestry of danger woven into the very fabric of her medieval quest.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the faint hope of reaching her ultimate destination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine for her and her crew.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, said to harbor a planet teeming with a life-giving element crucial to the survival of their dwindling homeworld.  Faster-than-light travel brought them closer, but the vast distances and unpredictable cosmic anomalies presented their own set of perilous challenges, a far cry from the dangers of a medieval road, but no less thrilling in their cosmic scale.
