
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a hidden oasis promising respite, the looming shadow of a mountain pass harboring bandits, or the distant glimmer of a city rich with untold stories and dangers.  The nights are filled with the crackling fire, whispered tales of mythical beasts and forgotten empires, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, a constant companion on this arduous journey across a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble freighter navigating the treacherous asteroid fields between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the void.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faces cosmic radiation, rogue gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. But the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fuels our journey across the infinite canvas of space.
