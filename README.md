
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties collected on her perilous journey from the Eastern markets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of the Black Death stalked her every step. Yet, the lure of undiscovered plant life, the thrill of charting her own course across unknown lands, fueled her onward, a tiny, determined figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive a constant, reassuring thrum against the cosmic silence.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos cluster, a region teeming with uncharted planets, bizarre alien lifeforms, and potentially, the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were far different than Elara's – hostile alien species, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of engine failure – but the spirit of adventure, the yearning to push beyond the known, burned just as brightly within her.
