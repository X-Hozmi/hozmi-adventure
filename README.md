
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to reach the fabled city of Porthaven for aid against the encroaching famine. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this unforgiving land, testing her courage and resilience with every step closer to her uncertain destiny.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the perils awaiting her on this perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking, yet familiar, sight.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was perilous, relying on ancient star charts and cutting-edge sensor technology.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional whisper of static from distant civilizations, held both wonder and danger, a constant reminder of the unimaginable distances and unpredictable cosmic events that could derail her quest.
