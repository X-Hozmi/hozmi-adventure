
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of a lost civilization.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils he faced. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends fueling his journey, spurred him relentlessly across the vast, uncharted landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes were daily occurrences. The loneliness of interstellar space was a constant companion, yet the hope of reuniting with long-lost kin, and the promise of discovering new worlds, provided the fuel for her intrepid voyage across the cosmic ocean.
