He’d left the familiar comfort of his castle weeks ago, drawn by whispers of a lost city hidden amidst treacherous mountains and haunted forests.  Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, navigating dense woodlands where mythical beasts were said to lurk.

The galaxy held countless wonders and terrors, from uncharted planets teeming with strange life to derelict starships drifting through the void.  But the potential reward – unlocking a source of unimaginable energy – made the risks worthwhile.
