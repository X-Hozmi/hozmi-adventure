
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan, his chainmail gleaming faintly under the grey sky, spurred his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the far-flung shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed their every step. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating flooded river crossings, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of trouble.  The allure of the sacred shrine, however, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  Navigation was a complex dance of gravitational forces and astrogation calculations, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of the fragile nature of their vessel.  While dangers of pirates and hostile alien lifeforms were less immediate, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present risk of equipment malfunction posed their own unique brand of terror.  The universe was a vast and beautiful ocean of unknowns, and Eva's bravery was the only compass guiding her through the darkness.
