
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled merchant hub said to hold untold riches, but also rumored to be guarded by fierce brigands and enchanted forests. This journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was her only hope of securing her family's future.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, while breathtakingly beautiful, held dangers far exceeding any earthly threat – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien civilizations.
