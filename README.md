
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the relentless sun, but her heart burned with the thrill of the journey.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold secrets older than kingdoms.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at unseen dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast canvas of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as galaxies blurred into streaks of color, a stark contrast to the slower pace of Elara's journey. While dangers were different – asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Jaxx, like Elara before him, was driven by the insatiable human hunger to explore the unknown, to push the boundaries of what was possible.
