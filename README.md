
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her horse picks its way through the rocky pass.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier between her and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of lost treasures and ancient magic fuel her journey, a dangerous gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for excitement, peril, and the unknown.  The open road is a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a true medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms is a constant challenge.  Faster-than-light travel brings its own set of unique dangers, from temporal anomalies to the strain of prolonged hyperspace jumps. Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, establishing contact with alien civilizations, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration propels her forward, a journey that epitomizes the thrilling adventures of the interstellar age.
