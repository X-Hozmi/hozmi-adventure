
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses' hooves kicking up clouds of ochre.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier on their journey to the Sultan's court.  Whispers of bandits and treacherous mountain passes filled their nights, a constant reminder of the perils of medieval travel, where a wrong turn could mean starvation, capture, or worse. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, but the lure of the Sultan's promised riches, and the glory awaiting a knight who dared to cross this harsh land, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, the vast emptiness of space both exhilarating and terrifying. The advanced technology of her ship provided a stark contrast to the rudimentary maps and limited supplies of Sir Kaelan, but the inherent risks remained: unforeseen solar flares, equipment malfunctions, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and hostile alien life.  The quest for discovery, however, fueled her journey across the galactic expanse.
