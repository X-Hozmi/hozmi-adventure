
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the fractured lands of Albion had been brutal; bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested him to his limits.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, hidden within the ruins of a forgotten kingdom, spurred him onward. Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his weary horse, echoed the perilous beauty of his quest.  The path ahead remained shrouded in mist, a fitting metaphor for the uncertainty and the glorious danger that lay in wait.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy had been flawless, but the hyperspace currents still left her stomach churning.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The dangers were not bandits or bogs, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light-years from any rescue.  But for Elara, the vast, unknown expanse of space held a far greater allure than any earthly kingdom ever could.
