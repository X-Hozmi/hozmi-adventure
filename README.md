
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague follow close behind.  But the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon, pushes her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, is a potential threat, but also a promise of the untold riches and secrets that await her.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust*.  The hyperspace jump left him disoriented, but the coordinates are locked onto the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  Though his sensors detect no immediate threats, the vast unknown whispers of unforeseen dangers and the thrill of discovery. The cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, stretches before him, a canvas of unimaginable distances and untold wonders.
