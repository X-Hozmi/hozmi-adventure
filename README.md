
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of a powerful magic.  Each day brought its own peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown spurred them forward, their hearts filled with both terror and a heady sense of adventure. The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a search for legend.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer', her ship a speck against the breathtaking panorama of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole, a shortcut through the vast expanse of space.  The risks were unimaginable – unforeseen gravitational anomalies, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space. But Eva, and her crew of hardened explorers, faced the cosmos with a steely determination, driven by the insatiable human hunger to explore the furthest reaches of existence.
