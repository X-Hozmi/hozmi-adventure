
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery, transforming the mundane journey into a perilous adventure filled with the unpredictable beauty and harsh realities of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the Andromeda galaxy, leaving the swirling nebulae of Xylos behind.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the unmapped regions, braving the treacherous gravitational anomalies and potential encounters with unknown alien civilizations. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held a constant undercurrent of danger. Every jump was a gamble, every new planet a potential treasure or a deadly trap in this grand, interstellar odyssey.
