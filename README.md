
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack-mules laden with meager supplies, trudged through the muddied rut of a forgotten Roman road.  Their quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with peril and unwavering determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a humanity teetering on the brink of resource depletion.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own set of dangers – unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  Yet, the vast, uncharted cosmos beckoned, promising untold wonders and the potential for a new beginning for her species.
