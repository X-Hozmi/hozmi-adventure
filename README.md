
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had already claimed a mule and half their supplies.  Each creak of their worn packhorses, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the glint of hope in their eyes, fueled by whispers of miraculous healing and ancient secrets, spurred them on through treacherous mountain passes and desolate valleys, their adventure a tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering determination.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope flickering faintly across light-years of interstellar space.  Navigation charts were unreliable, the void treacherous, and the constant threat of cosmic radiation a persistent shadow. Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to reunite with lost kin, propelled her through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, her adventure a cosmic odyssey against the vast, unforgiving beauty of the galaxy.
