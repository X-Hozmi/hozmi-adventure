
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creaking step was a gamble – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unforgiving terrain threatened to swallow them whole.  Yet, the promise of healing spurred her onward, a beacon in the deepening twilight, transforming a perilous journey into a pilgrimage of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal flickering faintly from light years away.  The risks were astronomical – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the potential discovery of a new civilization, a new hope for humanity's expansion, outweighed the dangers, fueling Comet's unwavering determination.
