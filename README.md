
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights crested the hill, the sun beating down on their battered armor.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-bleached fields and the ominous shadows of ancient forests.  Their quest: to reach the rumored hidden monastery of Saint Fiacre, said to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Every league was a gamble, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease, but the potential reward outweighed the peril a thousandfold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas clouds a breathtaking yet terrifying backdrop to their intergalactic voyage.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Equipped with cutting-edge technology, Eva and her crew navigated asteroid fields, evaded space pirates, and repaired critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation.  The journey itself, a relentless test of skill and endurance, was almost as perilous as the unknown awaiting them on the planet below.
