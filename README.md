
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, and the desperate hope for his sister's life, fuel his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, searching for a new habitable planet for a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering uncharted alien systems, Eva and her crew face unimaginable challenges.  The vastness of space, the potential for hostile encounters, and the constant threat of ship failure test their courage and resilience.  But the promise of a new dawn for humanity drives them onward, a beacon in the endless black.
