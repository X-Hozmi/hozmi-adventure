
The year is 1347.  Dust coats my throat as I trudge across the parched plains, the relentless sun beating down on my worn leather jerkin. My meager supplies dwindle with each passing day, the distant mountains a cruel mirage in the shimmering heat.  Bandits, disease, and starvation are constant threats, but the promise of the legendary City of Zerzura, a fabled oasis brimming with untold riches, fuels my weary steps. Each sunrise brings a new test of endurance, a gamble with fate across this unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby as we jump between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside my viewport are breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of cosmic wonder beyond human comprehension.  We are cartographers, charting unknown systems, braving the treacherous currents of hyperspace and the unpredictable nature of alien encounters. The risks are immense – pirate raids, hostile planetary environments, and the ever-present threat of encountering something truly beyond our understanding. Yet the allure of discovery, the thrill of mapping the uncharted territories of the cosmos, outweighs the fear.
