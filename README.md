
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming dully under the grey sky, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim reminder of the miles still stretching before him, a testament to the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political intrigue that threatened to derail her mission.  The vastness of space, however, was equally thrilling and terrifying, a constant reminder of the human capacity for both exploration and destruction.
