
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista of jagged peaks and hidden valleys, a landscape both breathtaking and terrifying. My destination: the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation were my constant foes, but the allure of the unknown propelled me onward, fueled by hope and the stories of brave knights before me.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was the soundtrack to my journey across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Stars blazed past like celestial fireflies as we navigated the treacherous currents of spacetime, a far cry from the muddy tracks of my medieval ancestor. My mission: to establish contact with the Xylos, a sentient species rumored to possess technology beyond human comprehension. The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional nebula or rogue asteroid field, held a different kind of terror – the cold, indifferent indifference of the cosmos.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of forging a new chapter in human history, was a powerful incentive, a thirst for knowledge as potent as the thirst for gold in those medieval times.
