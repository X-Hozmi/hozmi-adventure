
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and meager coins; it held the hope of finding her brother, lost somewhere in the sprawling, treacherous landscape of the Iberian Peninsula. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where a wrong turn could lead to banditry, starvation, or worse.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Advanced technology cushioned the harsh realities of interstellar travel, but the vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the faint hum of the ship's engines, fostered a unique kind of isolation.  The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed the risk; each new star system held the promise of alien landscapes, unknown civilizations, and the potential for a profound shift in humanity's understanding of the universe.
