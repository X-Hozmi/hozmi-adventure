
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood clinging to his sword.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril across treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, as he forged ahead, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula the color of amethyst.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  With a crew of seasoned explorers at her side, Eva pushed the boundaries of known space, driven by the insatiable human desire to explore the unknown, a modern-day odyssey amongst the stars.
