
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  The journey is fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, lawless villages, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but Elara’s determination burns brighter than any fear.  The whispered tales of Samarkand's wonders fuel her onward, a beacon in the vast, unknown expanse.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Nird, a world teeming with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and sentient, crystalline lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of space remains an untamed wilderness.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, each alien encounter a potential threat.  The reward, however, promises to fuel humanity's expansion across the galaxy, justifying the risks inherent in this audacious journey across the cosmos.
