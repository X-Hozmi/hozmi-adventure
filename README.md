
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains, stinging Elias's face as he urged his weary horse onward.  The parchment map, brittle with age, promised untold riches in the faraway Sultanate of Rum, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the endless expanse of the steppe offered little respite from the elements.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance – thirst, hunger, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, fueling his relentless drive towards a destiny he hoped would be worth the sacrifice.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel were all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar explorer.  The breathtaking cosmic vistas – nebulae painted across the black canvas of space, distant galaxies spiraling into infinity – were a constant reminder of the vast, uncharted territories waiting to be discovered, a thrilling counterpoint to the ever-present technical challenges and the loneliness of deep space.
