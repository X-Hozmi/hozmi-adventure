
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor had been relentless: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and rivers swollen with spring rains.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, but the glint of gold rumored to be hidden in the ruins of old Eldoria spurred him onward.  He dreamed not of comfort, but of glory and the riches that would secure his family's future.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, the gravitational stresses nearly buckling the hull.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and mercenaries, were tense but exhilarated, anticipating the wonders – and the dangers – of a newly discovered planet.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful expanse, held both unimaginable riches and the potential for catastrophic failure.  Their adventure was a cosmic gamble, one with potentially interstellar rewards.
