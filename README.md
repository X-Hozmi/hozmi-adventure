
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by witches and worse.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the King, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in every shadowed glen, and the very landscape seemed to conspire against his journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the Xylos system, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, rogue planets, and potentially hostile alien life.  While the technology was advanced, the vastness of the cosmos and the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel presented challenges as formidable as any medieval knight faced, testing both her skill and courage to their limits.
