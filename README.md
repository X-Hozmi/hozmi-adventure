
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her cloak pulled tight, urged her weary horse onward.  The King's decree, a quest for a mythical herb said to cure the Black Death, had led her far from her village.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of the disease itself.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to prove her worth, and the hope of saving lives fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos shimmering on the viewport.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned Kepler-186f colony, a perilous journey across uncharted galaxies.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, gravitational anomalies unpredictable, and the whispers of space pirates a constant threat.  But Jax, hardened by years of interstellar travel, felt the familiar adrenaline surge, the pull of the unknown a potent allure against the cold, calculating expanse of the cosmos.
