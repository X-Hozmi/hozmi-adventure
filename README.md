
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every aching muscle and sun-baked blister, a thrill pulsed through her veins. This arduous trek, filled with hardship and uncertainty, was her adventure, a testament to her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance steered her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy rumored to exist on a remote, uncharted planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien star charts were all in a day's work for Ryla. The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and dying stars, and the thrill of discovery fueled her insatiable desire for exploration, a legacy of adventurers past, now among the stars.
