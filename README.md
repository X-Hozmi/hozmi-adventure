
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a perilous cargo earned through months of bartering and dodging bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forests, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of this age.  Reaching Avignon, delivering her goods, meant survival; failing meant facing the wrath of a powerful merchant and the unforgiving wilderness. The journey was fraught with hardship but the potential reward – a new life – fueled her onward.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising new colony world light-years from the bustling galactic hub.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer, but the unknown dangers of uncharted systems were always a lingering threat.  The thrill of discovery, the potential for fortune, and the camaraderie of his crew were the stars that guided him across the vast emptiness, a far cry from the dirt roads and bandits of Elara's time, yet equally perilous in their own right.
