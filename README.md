
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the looming threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the perils facing a lone woman on such a journey. Yet, the promise of finding her long-lost brother in the distant city of Prague fueled her onward, pushing her past exhaustion and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across this treacherous expanse, between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, was a delicate dance of precision and daring.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of celestial bodies born and dying in fiery splendor.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, a desperate gamble against the vast emptiness of space, yet driven by the hope of finding survivors and bringing them home.
