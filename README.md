
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the Pope in Avignon, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in the shadows, starvation gnawing at his belly, and the ever-present fear of disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the challenge of the journey itself, spurred him on.  He was a knight errant, and his path was paved with adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the distant Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true adventure lay in discovering new worlds.  Each jump through hyperspace promised the encounter of new alien species, breathtaking landscapes, and the potential uncovering of ancient technologies lost to time.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of humanity's smallness and boundless potential for exploration.
