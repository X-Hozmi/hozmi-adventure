
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant shimmer in the Provençal sun.  Her journey from York had been arduous; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested her resolve. But the whispered promise of a hidden monastery, holding the key to her family's lost legacy, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating dense forests, bartering with wary villagers, and sleeping under a sky dusted with a million stars – but the allure of the unknown fueled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the Xylos nebula.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harboring life. The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the silent hum of the ship a constant reminder of her isolation.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and facing the unknown dangers of a potentially hostile alien environment were all in a day's work for Eva.  The thrill of exploration, the pursuit of knowledge, and the camaraderie of her crew kept her focused on reaching her destination, a tiny speck of light years away.
