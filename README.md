
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s worn boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in her nostrils.  Her pack, burdened with meager supplies and a well-worn map, felt heavier with each step towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and rumors of monstrous creatures whispered on the wind, yet the lure of Eldoria’s rumored healing waters and forgotten magic spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Every sunrise brought a fresh challenge, every sunset a deepening sense of wonder and dread.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart a steady rhythm against the hum of the hyperdrive.  Galaxies blurred past the viewport in a dizzying spectacle of colour and light.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the known universe, a journey fraught with the perils of cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the vastness of space held a different kind of allure, a thrilling, terrifying freedom that eclipsed even the danger, making the quest for the lost colony a gamble worth taking.
