
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as he guides his weary steed across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered about in taverns and sung by wandering minstrels, fuels his relentless journey.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation test his resolve. Each sunrise brings new challenges, but the lure of adventure, the whispered promises of untold riches and ancient secrets, drives him onward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and encounters with alien civilizations.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids instead of bandits, hostile alien fleets instead of marauding knights – the thrill of the unknown, the push to expand human knowledge and reach for the stars, mirrors the spirit of medieval adventurers, their courage tested not by sword and shield, but by the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
