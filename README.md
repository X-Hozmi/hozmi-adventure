
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of Solomon's lost mines.  Each sunrise brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of untold riches, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled his weary steps. The journey was arduous, a tapestry woven with hardship and the fleeting beauty of a sunset over a vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true challenge lay in the uncharted territories between galaxies, where cosmic anomalies warped spacetime and threatened to unravel the very fabric of her ship.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking in its scale, held a silent terror, a stark reminder of humanity's insignificance against the backdrop of the infinite cosmos.
