
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the parched landscape, their horses' hooves sinking into the cracked earth.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the chilling uncertainty of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a desperate gamble fueled by tales of unimaginable riches and a king's desperate plea for aid.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, making the path ahead seem as elusive as the city's rumored treasures.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth, was fraught with peril.  Cosmic radiation bombarded the ship's hull, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids demanded constant vigilance.  But the potential rewards – a new home for humanity, the discovery of alien life – outweighed the risks.  The vast, inky blackness of space held both terrifying and breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the familiar, comforting dangers of medieval travel.
