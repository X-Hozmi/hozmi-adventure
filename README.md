
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glimmer of hope, fueled by legends and ancient maps, spurred them onward through sun-drenched valleys and moonlit forests, their journey a testament to human resilience and the unwavering pursuit of a desperate hope.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', her ship a tiny speck against the backdrop of the Andromeda Galaxy. Their mission, far more ambitious than any medieval quest, was to establish contact with a newly discovered sentient species on the planet Xylos.  Navigating nebulae, evading asteroid fields, and facing the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of peril – the loneliness of infinite distance and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
