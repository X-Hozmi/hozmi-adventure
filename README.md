
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of ending the encroaching famine.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the desperate hope of a legendary treasure and the survival of their people.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Their mission, far more ambitious than any medieval quest, was to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human colony.  Navigating treacherous nebulae, avoiding pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and facing the ever-present threat of system failures, Elara and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration, driven by the unwavering hope of finding a new home among the cosmos.
