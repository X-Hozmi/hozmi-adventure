
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as his small band of mercenaries trudged across the sun-baked plains.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of lost empires, fueled their weary steps, pushing them ever onward towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the colonized galaxy, were on a mission to chart a newly discovered wormhole, potentially leading to uncharted territories.  The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the spirit of adventure remained the same, a burning ember of curiosity and courage propelling them towards the vast, unexplored expanse of the cosmos.
