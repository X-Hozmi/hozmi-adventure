
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, each day bringing the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforeseen wrath of nature.  Yet, the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels our relentless journey, pushing us onward despite the hardships.  Every sunrise brings a new challenge, every sunset a new story etched into the harsh landscape of our adventure.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' leaps across the void between galaxies, a tiny speck against the unimaginable grandeur of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust.  Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk against the unknown dangers of hyperspace. We navigate asteroid fields, evade the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and search for the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution. The thrill of discovery, however, outweighs the peril, each new planet a breathtaking canvas of alien landscapes and untold wonders waiting to be explored.
