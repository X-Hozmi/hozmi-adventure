
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a lost king's salvation.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resolve, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the mysteries that lay ahead.  Their journey was a tapestry woven from hardship and hope, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval adventurers.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanium crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage fraught with unpredictable spacetime anomalies and the lurking threat of pirate vessels.  The vast distances and alien landscapes were as daunting as any medieval wilderness, but  Eva's advanced technology and unwavering courage – the legacy of generations of interstellar explorers –  provided a slim chance of survival and success amidst the cosmic unknown.
