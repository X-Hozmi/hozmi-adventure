
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience, pushing him closer to his desperate hope.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting her ship in a terrifying, beautiful light.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet orbiting a distant binary star system.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for the seasoned explorer.  The vast emptiness of space held both incredible wonder and terrifying unknowns, a stark contrast to the familiar dangers of Earth, but the thrill of discovery propelled her forward.
