
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the snow-dusted peaks of the Alps.  My quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging my village.  Each treacherous pass, each icy river crossing, was a gamble with death, but the hope of salvation spurred me onward.  Fellow travelers – a grizzled mercenary, a cloaked scholar, and a silent woman with piercing eyes – provided fleeting camaraderie against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive was my constant companion, not the wind's howl.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as the 'Starseeker' jumped between galaxies, our destination a newly discovered planet teeming with life, or so the sensor readings suggested.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known Federation, nervously anticipated what we might find – new allies? Deadly predators?  The vastness of space instilled a different kind of fear than the harshness of the medieval world, a fear of the unknown, of the infinite possibilities that lay beyond our ship's viewport.
