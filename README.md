
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled in the heart of the Carpathian Mountains, said to hold the cure for her brother's ailment. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and the hope of a life-saving miracle. The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a constant test of her resilience and faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated efficiency of her ship's systems.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a perilous voyage across light-years of treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted systems.  The vastness of the cosmos offered both awe-inspiring wonders and the ever-present danger of encountering unforeseen anomalies or hostile alien lifeforms.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
