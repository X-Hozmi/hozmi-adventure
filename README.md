
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward.  The midday sun beat down on the parched earth, the only sound the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk cry overhead.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and battling the unpredictable warp currents tested her skills and the ship's resilience to the limits.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant, cold gleam of stars and the occasional vibrant cosmic phenomenon, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. The fate of a lost civilization rested on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any earthly burden.
