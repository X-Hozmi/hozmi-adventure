
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the harsh realities of hunger and thirst, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, etching the epic journey into their very souls.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways.  Captain Elara's starship, the *Starseeker*, hurtled through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril; unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the constant hum of the ship's hyperdrive were a testament to the dangers of interstellar travel.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, spurred Elara and her crew forward, their courage fueled by the vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos.
