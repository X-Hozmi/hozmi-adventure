
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with maps and dried provisions, felt like a weight of hope against the vast unknown.  This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every step. Yet, with each crest conquered and valley traversed, the thrill of adventure, of forging her own path in a world both beautiful and brutal, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with unpredictable celestial phenomena and potential encounters with alien civilizations – both benevolent and hostile.  The vastness of space, a terrifying yet exhilarating void, held the promise of discovery and untold riches, driving Eva and her crew across the infinite expanse, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
