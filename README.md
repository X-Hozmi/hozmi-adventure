
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains of Eurasia as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their worn leather boots crunched on frozen ground, the rhythmic sound a counterpoint to the howling wind and the creak of their heavily laden pack animals. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and a cure for the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure and the hope of salvation spurred them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a shimmering canvas of stars and cosmic dust, both awed and humbled her.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant vigilance against rogue space debris were just part of the routine for a seasoned explorer like herself.  The promise of discovering new life, new worlds, and unlocking the secrets of the universe fueled her relentless journey across the galactic expanse.
