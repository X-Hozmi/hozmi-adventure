
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the hill, the sun beating down on their worn leather armor.  Before them lay the vast, untamed expanse of the Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse. Their quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the distant abbey of St. Jude, felt as daunting as the endless forest itself. Each creak of their saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a nervous energy that was both terrifying and exhilarating.  The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the promise of untold riches and glory pushed them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking beauty and terrifying vastness of space.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the same adventurous spirit fueled her journey.  The unknown beckoned, promising scientific discovery, untold riches, and the satisfaction of pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
