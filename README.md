
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril.  Bandits were a constant threat, the terrain treacherous, and the whispers of mythical beasts fuelled by flickering campfire light kept her perpetually on edge. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient magic, propelled her onward.  The journey itself, fraught with hardship, was as much a part of the adventure as the destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel were routine, but the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the constant hum of the warp drive instilled a sense of awe that rivalled any earthly fear.  The true adventure wasn't just reaching Kepler-186f, but the journey across the unimaginable expanse of the cosmos itself.
