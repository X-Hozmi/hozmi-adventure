
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her small band, a motley collection of mercenaries and pilgrims, pressed onward, their destination a fabled city whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling whispers of the legendary mountain wraiths.  Survival, not glory, was their daily prayer.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula, the crimson dust swirling around her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of temporal distortion or encountering hostile alien patrols, but the potential rewards – reuniting with long-lost kin and uncovering a vital new energy source – fueled her journey, a voyage across the unimaginable expanse of space, a true adventure amongst the stars.
