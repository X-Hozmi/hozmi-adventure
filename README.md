
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavier with each league, held not gold, but a stolen map – a whispered legend of a hidden monastery said to contain the lost scriptures of Saint Brigid.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of the plague were minor obstacles compared to the allure of the unknown, the promise of uncovering a secret lost to time.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled her burning desire to reach her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far-flung planet of Aethel, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by sentient flora.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, but the potential reward – the salvation of his people – outweighed any danger. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, yet the thrill of exploration, the chase for something precious and unknown, remained a constant in both eras.
