
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched earth.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide to the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, holds the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded fever that claims so many travelers.  Yet, the lure of the Sunstone, its promise of untold riches and knowledge, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-jump malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate fleets are mere inconveniences compared to the unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted sectors. The fate of an entire civilization rests on his shoulders, and the vastness of space offers both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying isolation in equal measure.
