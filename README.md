
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim their lives, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – foraging for food, navigating unfamiliar terrain, and forging alliances with wary villagers –  all part of the arduous adventure that tested their courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing vital systems during perilous jumps through wormholes were all commonplace.  The vast distances and unknown dangers of interstellar space presented challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, yet the allure of discovery and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled her unwavering determination.
