
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both danger and discovery.  Bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her quest to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril but fueled by the whispered tales of its untold riches and ancient wisdom.  She pressed onward, the scent of faraway spices and the distant echo of desert winds urging her ever closer to her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate freighter was routine; the real challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the unknown dangers of an alien world.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new life and chart unmapped territories, outweighed any fear. The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and unimaginable wonders, beckoned her forward.
