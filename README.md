
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, charting a perilous path to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles he faced, but the whispers of Eldoria’s untold riches and ancient secrets fueled his relentless pursuit, a tangible beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose in his epic land-based adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids, a far cry from the simpler challenges of medieval travel.  Yet, the allure of discovering new life, charting unmapped star systems, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration mirrored Thomas's own drive centuries prior. The vastness of space, however, presented a different scale of risk, and a different kind of adventure altogether.
