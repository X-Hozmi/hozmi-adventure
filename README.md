
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s boots as she trudged across the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her roughspun tunic.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and hasty revisions, guided her through treacherous mountain passes and across whispering plains.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, hostile lords guarding their territories, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to hold the power of a thousand suns, pushed her onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The hum of the hyperdrive resonated through her bones, a familiar lullaby as she traversed the vast gulf between galaxies.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with exotic lifeforms.  The journey was fraught with peril, from rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes to the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But the potential scientific breakthrough, the chance to unlock the secrets of interstellar life, fuelled her unwavering determination.
