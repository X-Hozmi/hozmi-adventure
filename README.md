
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll; dust coated his boots and beard, and the meager rations were long gone.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland – pushed him onward.  He rode through sun-scorched plains, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and braved the hostility of both nature and rival knights, his resolve fueled by a desperate hope for salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and alien life.  Hyperdrive jumps across light-years were a commonplace hazard, yet the potential for catastrophic engine failure or unforeseen celestial events constantly loomed, making each journey a gamble with the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  The reward, however, was the survival of her people.
