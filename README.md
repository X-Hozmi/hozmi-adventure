Her worn map, more faded memory than reliable guide, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey from the ravaged fields of France to the rumored sanctuary of the Eastern Empire. The whispers of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient knowledge, fueled her perilous trek.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the cockpit of the *Stardust Drifter* shuddering as they jumped to hyperspace.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace, a planet shrouded in mystery and guarded by volatile nebulae.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, both awed and terrified him.  Years of training couldn't fully prepare him for the dangers that lay ahead – hostile alien civilizations, treacherous asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of the black hole.  The fate of two worlds rested on his shoulders.
