
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother – was a perilous journey. Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed, but the thought of her brother fueled her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of hope amidst the uncertainty of the medieval world.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both danger and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all commonplace hazards.  Yet, the promise of finding her ancestors, lost generations ago, spurred her onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the vast unknown of the future cosmos.
