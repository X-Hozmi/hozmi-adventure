
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather boots as he spurred his destrier onwards, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, a perilous journey to the Holy Land, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of bandits and mythical beasts echoed through the ancient trees. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to dodging the ever-present threat of highwaymen, forging his path through a tapestry of danger and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in lightyears.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions that roamed the interstellar lanes, and battling the ever-present threat of system failures, Eva faced dangers far removed from the medieval knight's, but just as perilous. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held secrets yet to be unveiled, and she was determined to find them.
