
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold forgotten magic and unimaginable riches.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the fractured kingdom, a perilous gamble for a life beyond the poverty of her village. Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the chilling reality of the road ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, navigating the chaotic hyperspace currents between galaxies.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, vibrated violently as they punched through a nebula, the swirling colors a breathtaking but deadly distraction.  The mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Xylos, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  The dangers weren't bandits or starvation, but unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of mechanical failure light years from any form of rescue.  The universe was a vast and unforgiving expanse, yet the allure of discovery burned brighter than any star.
