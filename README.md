Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes that tested both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

But Eva, hardened by years of exploration, was undeterred.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, was a siren song, calling her ever onward to uncover the secrets hidden amongst the stars.
