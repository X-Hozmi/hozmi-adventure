
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun a relentless adversary.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, sudden snowstorms that threatened to bury her alive, and the ever-present gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of the Sunstone, a relic of immense power hidden in the distant monastery, fueled her relentless trek. Each aching muscle, each scraped knee, was a testament to her unwavering pursuit of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a trial of both technology and endurance; hyperspace jumps risked tearing the vessel apart, and uncharted asteroid fields presented a constant threat. But the promise of the lost colony of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel, outweighed every risk.  The vast, star-dusted expanse held both unimaginable beauty and deadly secrets, making every light-year a gamble worth taking.
