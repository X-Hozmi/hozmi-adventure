
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest had been fraught with peril – mud-caked paths that tested the mettle of his destrier, skirmishes with bandits who coveted his meager supplies, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts lurking in the shadows. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fueled his relentless pursuit, a shimmering beacon in the darkness of the unknown. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a pulse of anticipation, a testament to the raw, untamed adventure that defined his life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents of the twin suns was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth. This was a different kind of wilderness, a cosmic expanse of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Her mission: to secure a vital mineral deposit from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien lifeforms both wondrous and deadly. The thrill wasn't just in the journey itself, but the risk – the constant threat of pirates, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, and the ever-present mystery of what lay beyond the next jump gate.  The universe was vast, and her ambition even greater.
