
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, push onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, is fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, swollen rivers demanding perilous crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease hang heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages, and constantly watching their backs for opportunistic thieves. Yet, the allure of the sacred city and the camaraderie forged in hardship make the relentless miles worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates is commonplace, but this journey presents a unique danger – a rogue gravitational anomaly predicted to destabilize the wormhole leading back to Earth. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, is a cruel mistress, demanding precision, courage, and an unwavering reliance on technology and the skills of her crew.  The stakes are higher than ever before.
