
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar spices clinging to the wind.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each dawn brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown, yet the unwavering hope of salvation pushes him onward through sun-scorched valleys and dark, whispering forests.  He travels with only a loyal squire and a tattered map, their journey a tapestry woven from grit, courage, and the unwavering belief in a whispered legend.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, across the inky void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of ending the interstellar war tearing apart the human federation.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, she relies on cutting-edge technology and a crew as diverse and resilient as the cosmos itself.  The vast expanse of space offers breathtaking vistas of nebulae and distant suns, but also harbors unimaginable dangers – from rogue black holes to hostile alien civilizations.  The weight of her mission and the vastness of space press upon her, but Eva, guided by unwavering determination, charts a course toward the unknown.
