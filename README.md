
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds a tattered map, a few meager coins, and the hope of reaching Constantinople before winter.  Each sunrise reveals new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every mile, her resolve strengthens, fueled by the whispered tales of exotic spices and the promise of a new life beyond her village.  The journey is arduous, but the spirit of adventure burns brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst cosmic giants.  He's on a decades-long mission to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, mapping new planets and encountering alien civilizations with technologies far beyond his own understanding.  The vast emptiness of space is a constant companion, a humbling reminder of humanity's insignificance against the backdrop of the universe.  But the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, propels him forward, a modern-day explorer seeking new worlds across the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
