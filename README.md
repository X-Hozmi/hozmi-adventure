
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary steps, pushing them further into the unknown wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps were risky, the void a terrifying expanse punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae.  Each jump risked catastrophic failure, and the crew faced the constant threat of cosmic radiation and unforeseen anomalies. Yet, the possibility of finding her lost people, and the knowledge that their survival depended on her, spurred Ryla onward, across the unimaginable distances of space.
