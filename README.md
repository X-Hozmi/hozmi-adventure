
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to me like a second skin.  Each rise offered a new panorama of rolling hills and distant castles, each valley whispered tales of bandits and forgotten shrines. My journey, from the bustling port of Marseille to the mysterious monasteries of the Pyrenees, was fraught with peril –  bandits, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, a sense of exhilarating freedom surged within me, a reward for embracing the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  The crimson dust of Xylos still clings to my boots, a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the Althea's bridge.  My mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Cygnus X-1, a region teeming with unmapped planets and the whispers of long-dead civilizations.  Warp drives hum, a constant thrum against the silence of space, as we leap between star systems, each jump a gamble, each new world a breathtaking gamble of discovery and the potential for unimaginable dangers.
