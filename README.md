
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  But the whispered promise of Eldoria, and the desperate hope for his people, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar space tested her and her crew to their limits.  Yet, the potential for galactic exploration, and the hope of reuniting with a lost civilization, drove them ever onward across the vast emptiness between the stars.
