
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast expanse of the Rhineland stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little besides dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lies Cologne, a whispered promise of sanctuary and perhaps, a chance to reunite with her estranged brother.  But the road is long, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of illness.  Each sunrise brings new dangers, but with them, the thrill of the unknown, the exhilarating pulse of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f is risky, a daring leap across uncharted space.  Her crew, a band of seasoned explorers and hopeful colonists, hold their breath as the warp drive engages, spitting them into a new solar system. The promise of a habitable world, of a new beginning for humanity, fuels their journey, pushing them past the fear of the void and the ever-present threat of stellar anomalies.  The adventure is not just across galaxies, but within themselves, a testament to the boundless curiosity of humankind.
