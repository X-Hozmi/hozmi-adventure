
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a meticulously drawn map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Brigid.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of uncovering a legend lost to time.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of pushing further into the unknown, the rhythm of hooves on earth her only constant companion.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Razor" Killian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets fueled her and her crew, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the boundless expanse of the cosmos, the hum of the engines a lullaby against the deafening silence of space.
