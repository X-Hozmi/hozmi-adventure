
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three packhorses groaned under the weight of supplies for a journey to the Holy Land.  Their route snaked across the treacherous, muddy tracks of France, then the sun-baked plains of Italy, each day a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Every creak of the saddle leather, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  The chivalric code was their guide, but their survival depended on sharp wits and even sharper blades.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, were on the hunt for the legendary Aetherium crystal, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of space pirates – but the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly in the sterile confines of the starship as it had on the dusty roads of medieval Europe.  Their journey was a gamble against the vastness of space itself.
