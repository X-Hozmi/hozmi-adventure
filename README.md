
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across scorching plains, and over treacherous mountain passes. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating confusing river crossings, bartering for meager meals in hushed villages, and constantly dodging the ever-present threat of disease and violence. The adventure, while perilous, fueled her spirit, the vastness of the land a constant reminder of her own resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant cosmic tapestry of gas and dust.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from the bustling galactic hub of New Terra.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Syndicate, and battling the extreme weather conditions of Kepler-186f were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacefarer.  But the thrill of discovery, the endless expanse of space, and the potential for groundbreaking scientific advancement kept Razor and his crew pushing forward, embracing the unimaginable risks inherent in galactic exploration.
