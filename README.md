
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward.  The map, brittle and stained with rain, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains – a lost city of gold rumored to hold the secrets of a forgotten empire.  Each day brought fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, propelled him forward, the clang of his armor a lonely counterpoint to the vast, silent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of interdimensional travel were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer. The vastness of space, the alien landscapes glimpsed during hyperspace jumps, and the potential for discovery fueled her, a modern-day explorer pushing the boundaries of the known universe.
