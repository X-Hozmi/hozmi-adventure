
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mare onward.  The sun beat down on the endless expanse of the French countryside, the only respite the occasional shade offered by a gnarled oak.  Her quest – to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother – pushed her further, despite the treacherous roads, the threat of bandits, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown that lay ahead. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her enduring will.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, but the thrill of exploration remained.  He was on a mission to chart unmapped galaxies, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of black holes, rogue asteroids, and alien encounters both hostile and wondrous. The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, was also isolating, a constant reminder of the fragile bubble of life within his ship, a lone beacon in the endless darkness.
