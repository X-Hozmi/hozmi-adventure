
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the unknown perils that lurked in the shadowed forests and along the lonely roads.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust*.  Her mission: a daring rescue mission across a thousand light-years to retrieve a vital scientist stranded on the ice planet of Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps between galaxies tested the limits of both the ship's technology and her courage, each hyperspace transit a leap of faith into the vast, uncharted expanse.  While pirates and hostile alien life posed threats far different from Elara's medieval woes, the thrill of discovery and the ever-present risk of catastrophic failure fueled Eva's drive across the cosmic ocean, a journey as perilous and inspiring as any undertaken in the age of knights and chivalry.
