
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s warhorse as he rode towards the Whispering Mountains, a legendary range said to hold a lost city of gold. His small band, weathered and wary, navigated treacherous passes, their journey a constant battle against unforgiving terrain and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – icy rivers to ford, dense forests to traverse, and the chilling knowledge that the rumors of mythical beasts lurking in the shadows might be more than just folklore.  Their quest for glory and fortune was a constant gamble against the raw, untamed power of nature and the capricious whims of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists and astro-navigators, charted a course across unmapped galaxies, seeking a legendary planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre, alien life forms were daily occurrences. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, presented challenges far beyond anything Sir Kaelan could have imagined. Yet, the allure of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, burned as brightly in Eva's heart as it had in the knight's centuries before.
