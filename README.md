
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a life away from the shadowed village she'd escaped.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, held the promise of adventure, the thrill of the unknown stretching before her like the endless road itself. Bandits, storms, and treacherous terrain were constant companions on this journey, testing her strength and resolve at every turn.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* pierced the nebula, its navigation systems charting a course across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vibrant colours of distant star clusters painted the viewport, a breathtaking backdrop to the hum of the engines and the quiet efficiency of her crew.  This wasn't a journey for survival; it was a mission of exploration, a quest for knowledge and the potential discovery of new life forms beyond human imagination.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held its own perils—uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failure.
