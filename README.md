
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a fresh test of her resilience, each sunset a hard-won victory against hunger, exhaustion, and the unknown. Yet, the stories whispered in taverns and around crackling fires, the glimpses of breathtaking beauty, and the camaraderie forged with fellow travelers fuel her onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a task demanding both technological prowess and unwavering courage.  The vast emptiness between stars is punctuated by the occasional encounter with alien life, some benevolent, some hostile.  Navigation through asteroid fields and wormholes tests the limits of her ship and crew, the constant threat of equipment malfunction adding to the pressure.  But the breathtaking beauty of uncharted planets, the thrill of discovery, and the possibility of contact with civilizations beyond human comprehension, make the risks worthwhile.
