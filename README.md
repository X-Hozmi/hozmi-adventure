
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain paths, bartering for meager rations in isolated villages, and constantly evading the watchful eyes of bandits who lurked in the shadowed valleys. The allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled my journey despite the ever-present dangers.  The journey itself, a test of endurance and cunning, was as rewarding as any treasure I might find.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting drone as we jumped between star systems.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of nebulae and the cold, hard light of stars, held a different kind of terror than the Alps, a boundless, lonely expanse that dwarfed even the most ambitious human endeavor.  Yet, the potential to discover new life, to expand the boundaries of human existence, drove us onward, each warp jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
