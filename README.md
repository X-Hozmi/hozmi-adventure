
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was a brutal tapestry woven with rain-soaked nights huddled around meager fires, the constant threat of bandits, and the aching monotony of endless miles.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers to ford, and the ever-present fear of illness. Yet, the allure of Jerusalem, the whispers of holy relics and the chance to prove his valor, spurred them onward, their determination as strong as the iron on their horseshoes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was far removed from the medieval hardships of Gareth, but no less perilous.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and enduring the psychological strain of months spent light-years from Earth demanded a different kind of courage.  Yet, the promise of unlocking galactic exploration, of charting unmapped constellations, fueled her and her crew, their spirits as boundless as the cosmos itself.
