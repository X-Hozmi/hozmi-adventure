
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling campfires, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, wild animals stalked the high crags, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the glint of the distant sun on the rumoured city's golden towers spurred her onward, a beacon in the harsh landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Each jump across the void was a calculated risk, a dance with hyperspace currents that could crush a vessel in an instant.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper on the galactic wind of a thriving human settlement cut off from the rest of known space.  The vastness of the cosmos was both exhilarating and terrifying, a testament to humanity's ambition and the ever-present uncertainty of exploration among the stars.
