
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a chaotic tapestry of creaking wagons, weary oxen, and even wearier men, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the unpredictable whims of the desert, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the Silk Road, the whispered legends of Cathay, and the chance to trade our humble wares for unimaginable riches fuels our relentless journey.  The miles are harsh, but the spirit of adventure burns bright.

A thousand years hence, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of generations, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life.  The journey is measured not in days, but in subjective time, warped by the immense speeds we achieve.  While some crew members slumber in cryogenic pods, others navigate the treacherous currents of nebulae and contend with the unpredictable anomalies of interstellar space. The reward? The potential discovery of a new world, a new beginning for humanity, a legacy etched in the very fabric of the cosmos.
