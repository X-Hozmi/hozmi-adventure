
Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed ravines, treacherous river crossings swollen by recent rains, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, hidden within the lost city of Eldoria, propelled him forward, fueled by whispers of untold riches and ancient magic.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's: asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize her ship, unpredictable wormholes capable of spitting her out in uncharted regions of space, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on unsuspecting explorers.  But the promise of discovering new life, and perhaps even a new home for humanity, spurred her on.
