
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine stretching before her like a rumpled, ochre cloth.  Her journey to Avignon was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to the air like a shroud. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of encountering the unexpected, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Starseeker*.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had been long, punctuated by warp jumps that sent shivers down his spine and the ever-present hum of the ship’s Alcubierre drive.  Alien landscapes, uncharted star systems, and the constant threat of pirate raids were just a few of the challenges they’d faced. But the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the universe’s secrets, outweighed the inherent dangers of interstellar exploration.
