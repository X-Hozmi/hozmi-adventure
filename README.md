
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had morphed into a desperate scramble for survival.  Bandit raids were frequent, the roads treacherous, and rumors of a plague sweeping the land added a chilling layer of dread.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating dense forests, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager sustenance in sparsely populated villages.  The allure of the sacred destination warred with the stark reality of the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital cargo of terraforming agents to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates was routine, but the unpredictable warp currents posed a constant threat.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, instilled both awe and a deep sense of isolation.  The success of her mission – the potential for a new human civilization – rested solely on her skill and courage.
