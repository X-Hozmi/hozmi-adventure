
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril from the outset.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested their mettle.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, a sliver of faith against the vast, unforgiving landscape, but every sunset painted the sky with the somber hues of uncertainty.  Their quest, however, burned brighter than any hardship, fueling their weary steps towards the distant shrine.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the vast distances between star systems still held a sense of daunting isolation.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  But the allure of the uncharted regions of the Andromeda galaxy, the promise of discovering new worlds and untold riches, outweighed the risks.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space, though terrifying, held an irresistible allure.
