
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Castilian plains stretching before her.  Her journey to Santiago de Compostela was a tapestry woven with the threads of danger and hope:  bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the sting of hunger gnawing at her belly, the kindness of strangers offering bread and shelter. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-earned victory, forging her spirit stronger with every league traversed.  The path was long, arduous, and uncertain, but the promise of the holy city spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ryker" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her cockpit.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, the unpredictable nature of wormholes a constant threat.  But the potential for life, for a new beginning amidst the vast, uncharted cosmos, fuelled her courage and outweighed the risk.  The galaxy was a dangerous place, but for Ryker, exploration was in her blood, a legacy echoing across the stars.
