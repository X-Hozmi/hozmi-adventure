
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage fueled by whispers of ancient magic and lost relics, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested her resolve at every turn.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a desperate hope that tomorrow would bring her closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebulae through the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant dance with temporal anomalies and rogue asteroids, but the thrill of exploration outweighed the risk.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of uncharted planets, and the hope of finding survivors fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
