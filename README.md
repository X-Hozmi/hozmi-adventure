
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, with every milestone passed, the thrill of the unknown fuels our journey.  We share whispered tales of mythical beasts and lost kingdoms, the promise of exotic spices and silks a potent antidote to the hardships of the road.  The vast, unpredictable landscape itself is our greatest adversary and our most captivating companion.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship capable of faster-than-light travel, hurtles through the inky blackness towards the Andromeda Galaxy. Our mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the possibility of encountering hostile alien life – the spirit of adventure remains the same. The boundless expanse of space, a tapestry woven with nebulae and distant suns, holds a mystery that compels us onward, despite the perilous journey.
