
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled around them, a gritty halo obscuring the already hazy horizon.  Their journey across the blighted lands to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory against the elements and the unknown.  Eldoria, if it truly existed, felt less a destination and more a desperate hope clinging to the frayed edges of their endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare element vital to sustaining life on New Terra.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant, nerve-wracking dance with fate.  Communication with base was spotty, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms added a layer of chilling uncertainty to their interstellar voyage.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, promising both incredible rewards and the ultimate oblivion.
