
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her small caravan, a motley collection of merchants and pilgrims, creeps forward, the rhythmic clang of their mule bells a counterpoint to the hawk's cry overhead.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, but the promise of the fabled city of Samarkand, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon, spurs them onward.  The journey is a tapestry woven with hardship and camaraderie, a true medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its engines a hum against the silent vastness of intergalactic space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a region teeming with unmapped planets and the potential for discovery beyond imagining.  The journey is fraught with peril – treacherous nebulae, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the allure of the unknown galaxies, the chance to uncover new life and civilizations, outweighs all risk.  This is a voyage into the future, an adventure among the stars.
