
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I traversed the treacherous Alpine passes.  A biting wind whipped at my cloak, a stark contrast to the summer heat I'd endured in the sun-drenched fields of Provence just weeks ago. This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled dangerously with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of sickness clung to the air like a miasma. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown propelled me forward, the promise of spiritual cleansing outweighing the hardship of the road.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, the stars themselves are my highways.  My vessel, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts through the inky black between galaxies, the nebulae swirling around us like cosmic paint strokes.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions.  This journey, unlike my medieval ancestor's, is faster, safer (in theory), yet the vastness of space instills a different kind of awe and dread.  The unknown here is not just bandits and disease, but the uncharted territories of the cosmos, the potential for discovery and the chilling possibility of encountering something beyond human comprehension.
