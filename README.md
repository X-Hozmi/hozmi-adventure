
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to secure a vital alliance across the treacherous mountain passes and into the heart of Aragon. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease lurked around every bend, but the promise of glory and the weight of her duty spurred her onwards.  Each creaking cart wheel, each snort of her weary steed, was a step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Starseeker*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets in the Andromeda Galaxy. Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the universe, but the vast distances still held peril.  Wormhole instability, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms made every jump a gamble.  But the hope of finding the colonists, and the thrill of charting unexplored territories, fueled her crew's resolve as they navigated the shimmering cosmic ocean.
