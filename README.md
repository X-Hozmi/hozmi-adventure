
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the King's Road had been brutal; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and magical artifacts, spurred him onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been harrowing, a near-miss with a rogue asteroid field leaving her shields flickering.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology capable of bridging the gap between galaxies.  Unlike Reginald's earthly struggles, Eva's challenges were interstellar in scale, involving navigating treacherous cosmic currents, evading pirate factions, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space.
