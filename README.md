
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind.  The quest to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria was a perilous one, each day bringing new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  Yet, the glint of rumored gold and the whispered promises of untold power spurred him onward, his heart pounding with a mixture of dread and exhilarating anticipation.  Each sunrise brought the hope of discovery, each sunset the weight of the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her destination the unexplored galaxy of Andromeda.

Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue plasma storms, and repairing hyperdrive malfunctions were commonplace occurrences.  The allure of new worlds, teeming with alien life and untold resources, fuelled her crew's dedication, even as the vast emptiness of space pressed in, a constant reminder of their vulnerability in the face of the infinite.
