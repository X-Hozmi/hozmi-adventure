
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun a molten orb sinking towards the horizon.  His journey from the Emerald Isle to the Holy Land had been fraught with peril – bandits ambushing in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes testing both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his resilience.  Yet, the lure of Jerusalem, the whispered tales of holy relics and ancient mysteries, fueled his weary steps onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic beauty a stark contrast to the cold, hard reality of interstellar travel.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, plotting a course through treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted gravitational anomalies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, faced dangers far beyond any medieval knight could imagine: rogue energy storms, sentient space flora, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovering a new, habitable planet, a paradise lost to the annals of time, drove them relentlessly forward.
