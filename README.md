Their journey from York to Constantinople was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, each sunrise brought the promise of new sights and experiences, the camaraderie of fellow travelers a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Each planet presented a unique challenge, from navigating treacherous gravity wells to deciphering alien languages and cultures.  The universe was vast, and Ryla, with a crew of intrepid explorers, was only just beginning to scratch its surface.
