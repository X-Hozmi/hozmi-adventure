
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the battlefield he'd fled. His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing sister, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, wolf-infested forests, and into the shadow of crumbling castles ruled by capricious lords. Each sunrise brought new dangers, new challenges, but the hope of healing spurred him onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a civilization rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the widening rift between human and synthetic life.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and decoding cryptic alien signals, Elara and her crew faced perils far beyond those of any medieval knight. Yet, the vastness of space held a different kind of beauty, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders that fueled their determination to overcome the impossible odds and reach their distant goal.
