
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Zerzura, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons,  storms threatened to engulf her in their wrath, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of the unknown fueled her onward, the whispers of ancient magic and forgotten wonders a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanite crystals across the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light years and perilous asteroid fields.  The crew faced down sentient space pirates, navigated treacherous gravitational anomalies, and battled the ever-present threat of engine failure.  But the promise of untold riches and the thrill of charting unmapped territories spurred them onwards, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the exhilarating, terrifying unknown.
