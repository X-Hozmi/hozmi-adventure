
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of the Holy Roman Empire, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the unpredictable whims of the harsh landscape itself.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was fraught with peril, demanding resilience and cunning, but the whispered promise of salvation spurred her onward, despite the gnawing fear that clung to her like the dust.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, battling the gravitational pull of celestial bodies as vast and unforgiving as any medieval plain.  The challenges were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate vessels – but the same indomitable spirit that drove Elara fueled Eva.  The vast, uncharted cosmos presented a terrifying, magnificent unknown, yet the possibility of finding her lost kin pushed her to conquer the interstellar void.
