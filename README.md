
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Fiacre.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit attack or worse, the chilling whispers of the Black Death already creeping across the land.  The journey was a gamble against time, disease, and the unforgiving landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous currents of the Void, they leaped between wormholes, each jump a perilous dance with unknown energies and potential spatial anomalies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made this intergalactic voyage a thrilling, and terrifying, odyssey.
