
The year is 1348.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease loomed large.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset a reminder of the immense challenge ahead.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, a far cry from the relative predictability of medieval travel. Yet, the dangers were just as real, perhaps more so; a single malfunction could mean the death of her crew, the loss of the precious cargo, or worse, a fate unknown in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
