
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping my cloak around me like a frantic bird.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between me and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each day was a gamble – against starvation, bandits, and the unpredictable wrath of nature. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient secrets fueled my journey, pushing me onward despite the hardship and uncertainty.  The thrill of the unknown, the sheer audacity of attempting such a perilous trek, was reward enough.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped, the familiar lurch throwing me against the console.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The galaxy stretched before us, a tapestry of stars and nebulae, both awe-inspiring and terrifying in its vastness.  Each jump was a calculated risk, a leap of faith into the uncharted darkness between solar systems.  The quest for new life, new worlds, drove us, fuelled by a human curiosity that transcends time and distance, a thirst for adventure that echoes the medieval traveler's, only on a cosmic scale.
