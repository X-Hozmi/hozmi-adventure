
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their three weary packhorses trudged onward, the biting wind whipping at their cloaks.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onwards through the harsh beauty of the medieval landscape.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking vistas, a testament to the enduring human spirit's capacity for both resilience and unwavering purpose.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum as it leaped between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy. Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space presented dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's wildest imaginings. Yet, the hope of finding the colonists, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, and the sheer wonder of the cosmos fueled her unwavering determination.  Each jump was a gamble, each system a new and breathtaking mystery.
