
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel, containing only a few meager coins and a map stained with the sweat of countless journeys, swung rhythmically against her hip.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril: bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of reaching the legendary city of Samarkand, spurred her onward.  This was no mere journey; it was a quest, a testament to her unwavering spirit.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The view from the cockpit was breathtaking: a swirling nebula of unimaginable colours, a tapestry woven from gas and dying stars.  Their destination, Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, held the promise of new life, new discoveries, and untold riches.  The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the spirit of adventure, that burning desire to explore the vast unknown, remained unchanged.
