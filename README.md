
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the midday heat, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Pyrenees.  Each rise offered a breathtaking panorama, yet also held the threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present hunger.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague that ravaged his homeland.  He carried with him only his sword, a meager supply of dried meats, and the unwavering hope that fueled his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the far reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hyperdrive hummed a constant, reassuring thrum against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Ahead lay the unknown, filled with the promise of new civilizations and the very real danger of pirate fleets and uncharted gravitational anomalies.  But with her loyal crew beside her, she faced the cosmos with courage and unwavering determination.
