
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the urgency of her mission, the hope for her people, spurred her onward, her journey a testament to the unwavering courage of those who dared to brave medieval peril for a sliver of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel had made interstellar distances manageable, but the hazards remained – unpredictable wormholes, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning hyperdrive.  For Rexx, this wasn't just a mission; it was a gamble against the vastness of space, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of knowledge and survival in a galaxy teeming with wonder and danger.
