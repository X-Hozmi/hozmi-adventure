
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey, a solitary knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble to save a dying race from a cosmic plague.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and solar flares; instead of starvation, the threat of oxygen depletion and system failures. The vastness of space was a different kind of unforgiving, a silent, breathtaking expanse that dwarfed even the largest earthly plains, yet the human spirit's thirst for exploration and survival remained the same, echoing through time.
