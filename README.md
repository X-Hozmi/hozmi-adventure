
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her mule laden with meager supplies.  This journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, is fraught with peril. Bandits roam the desolate stretches, and the whispers of a monstrous beast guarding a mountain pass fuel her every fearful step.  Yet, the promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge drives her onward, each sunrise a testament to her unwavering resolve.  The open road, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, is her destiny.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla Jax navigates her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and seek out habitable planets for humanity’s expanding reach.  Warp drives hum, a symphony of controlled chaos, as they jump between star systems, each jump a gamble against unknown gravitational forces and potential hostile encounters with alien civilizations.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, stretches before them, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders and the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown.
