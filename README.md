
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the last surviving seed of the lost whispering wheat, a treasure she risked everything to transport to the monastery in the north.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her every step, but the whisper of the wind through the tall grasses and the distant sight of soaring eagles spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vastness of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Kepler-186f was almost complete, a risky hyperspace route bypassing the heavily patrolled Orion Arm.  The bounty on his head – for smuggling  rare xenocrystals – was astronomical, but the reward promised even greater riches.  As the ship emerged from the warp, the alien twin suns of Kepler-186f bathed the cockpit in an ethereal glow, a promise of both untold wealth and the ever-present danger of a galaxy teeming with pirates and interstellar authorities.
