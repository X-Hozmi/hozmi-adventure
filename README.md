
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  His journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease stalked him like a shadow. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of glory, fueled his weary limbs and kept him pressing towards the horizon.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the possibility of rescuing the colonists, of unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f, spurred her on, a beacon brighter than any star in the inky black.
