
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn leather satchel held not just provisions, but a king's ransom in secrets – secrets she carried to a distant monastery, risking bandit ambushes and treacherous mountain passes for the safety of her charge. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, for peril, for a destiny yet unwritten.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for intergalactic travel.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a gamble that meant navigating treacherous wormholes and evading the ruthless Kryll pirates.  The vastness of space held both wonder and unimaginable danger, a thrilling uncertainty that fueled his every daring manoeuvre.
