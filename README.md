The trail, barely more than a goat path, wound through the rugged foothills of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and guarded by creatures of nightmare.

But the promise of new worlds, uncharted civilizations, and scientific breakthroughs fueled Elara's unwavering determination.  The cosmos stretched before her, an infinite ocean of opportunity and peril.
