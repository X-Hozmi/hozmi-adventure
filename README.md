
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each creak of the saddle and each breath of crisp mountain air, the thrill of adventure fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her cockpit.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and filled with the unknown.  The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  But the same adventurous spirit that drove Elara centuries ago burned within Eva, propelling her into the vast, uncharted cosmos.
