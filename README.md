Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a city of gold and unimaginable riches, or so the grizzled trader had claimed.  Bandit trails, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were the true riches he was accumulating, each mile a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving men who roamed it.  His only companions were the worn map clutched in his hand and the unwavering hope fueling his weary bones.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of glittering stars and ominous dark matter, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and the constant hum of the ship’s engines were her daily realities.  The promise of discovery, the chance to chart unknown worlds and unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, spurred her onward, a modern-day adventurer pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
