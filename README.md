
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she rode, the relentless sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast Sahara.  Bandits, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies were constant threats, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, each creaking wheel of her cart a testament to her unwavering resolve.  The whispered tales of magical artifacts and forgotten gods fueled her every step across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the perils of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, tested the limits of his ship and his crew.  But the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and unlocking the secrets of the universe propelled them forward, each hyperspace jump a leap into the unknown.
