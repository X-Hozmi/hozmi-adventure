
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the sprawl of Constantinople shimmering in the distance like a mirage.  Her journey from the frozen north had been arduous; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies had tested her resolve.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the thrill of the unknown.  She carried a map, faded and torn, promising riches and a legendary artifact – a gamble worth taking for a woman with nothing left to lose but her life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic galaxy map swirling around him.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, was hurtling through the void, bound for the Xylos system, a cluster rumored to hold a lost civilization's technology.  The jump to hyperspace had been rough, pushing the ship to its limits, but the potential reward – unimaginable power – eclipsed the risk.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient star charts were all just another day at the office for a seasoned galaxy-hopper like Rexx.
