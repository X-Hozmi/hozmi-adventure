The chill wind whipped across the desolate moorland, a stark contrast to the sun-baked plains and bustling city-states he'd left behind months ago.

Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown brush, held the promise of both peril and discovery as he pressed deeper into the unknown, his loyal squire ever at his side.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years of uncharted space.

Every jump through hyperspace, every encounter with alien lifeforms, risked everything, but the promise of a new beginning burned brighter than any star.
