
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her small band of companions, a motley crew bound together by shared desperation and a thirst for adventure, spurred their weary horses onward.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that stalked them as relentlessly as the shadow of the looming mountains.  Their destination: the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and secrets.  Their journey, a gamble against starvation, betrayal, and the very elements themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between galaxies.  The iridescent nebulae outside her viewport shifted and swirled, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic wonder.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for a desperate humanity clinging to survival after Earth’s collapse.  The dangers were less tangible than Elara's, but no less perilous; rogue black holes, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling isolation of the vast unknown threatened to claim them at any moment.  The stars held both promise and peril.
