
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a dangerous mission to secure a vital alliance with a remote, rumored-to-be-hostile clan nestled in the Pyrenees.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the ever-present sense of peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the treacherous terrain itself were all constant threats on her arduous journey.  She pressed on, fueled by duty and a flicker of hope for a peaceful resolution.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a settlement rumored to possess technology capable of bridging galactic rifts.  The vast emptiness between stars held its own terrors – unpredictable gravitational currents, pirate vessels lurking in the dark, and the ever-present fear of encountering something wholly unknown and hostile.  But the allure of the unknown, the potential for discovery, far outweighed the risks for this intrepid starship captain.
