
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of monstrous beasts echoed in the dark.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the allure of Eldoria, a city said to hold the secrets of immortality, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, vibrant colours swirling around them like cosmic paint.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable gravitational anomalies was commonplace.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, but the hope of finding the lost colonists, and uncovering the secrets of their disappearance, pushed them further into the uncharted darkness.
