
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We've faced brigands, dodged torrential downpours that turned the path into a churning river, and bartered our dwindling supplies for meager rations in forgotten villages.  Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of hope, a fragile shield against the ever-present threat of the unknown, whispering promises of lost treasures and untold riches.  But more than gold, we seek the legend itself.

Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  The 'Starseeker', a vessel of impossible grace and terrifying power, cuts through the nebula, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space. Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds.  The cold vacuum of space, the ever-present risk of encountering hostile lifeforms, and the sheer loneliness of the cosmos are constant companions.  Yet, with every jump to hyperspace, every new planet surveyed, the thrill of discovery burns brighter than the distant suns.  The universe is a boundless ocean, and we are its intrepid explorers.
