
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I led my small band across the snow-covered Carpathian Mountains.  Each creak of the laden pack animals, each labored breath in the thin air, was a testament to our audacious journey.  We sought the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in dusty tomes and tavern tales – a city of gold and unimaginable wonders hidden amongst treacherous peaks and unforgiving wilderness.  The biting wind carried the scent of pine and impending danger, a stark contrast to the alluring promise of untold riches and glory.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the ship as we leaped across the vast chasm separating the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Instead of rugged mountains, we navigated swirling nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields.  Our mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology far surpassing our own.  The risk was immense; the vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless perils. But the potential reward – contact with a long-lost human civilization – made the impossible journey a necessary gamble.
