
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her roughspun tunic.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother – led her through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains harassed by bandits, and through whispering forests where ancient magic lingered. Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of healing fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting her ship in ethereal hues.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey, a perilous dance between asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, was a testament to human ingenuity, a testament to the courage needed to traverse the infinite gulf between worlds.  The galaxy stretched out before her, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and unknown dangers, each jump a leap into the thrilling, boundless future.
