Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto his face, mirroring the rugged terrain they'd crossed.  Behind him, a straggling line of pack animals carried their meager supplies; ahead, the rumored lost city of Eldoria – a prize of untold riches and ancient secrets – beckoned.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents between galaxies was a constant gamble, a dance with cosmic forces far beyond human comprehension.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vista outside – celestial bodies of unimaginable size and color swirling in an ethereal ballet.  The quest for the mythical Xantus crystals, a source of near-limitless energy, promised unimaginable power…and equally unimaginable danger.
