Each shadow held the promise – or threat – of bandit, beast, or worse.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists, a journey fraught with peril but fueled by the hope of untold riches and glory.  The biting wind carried the scent of pine and damp earth, a constant reminder of the untamed wilderness that stretched before him, a vast and unforgiving landscape to be conquered.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Vast, incandescent clouds of gas and dust painted the cockpit in a kaleidoscope of impossible colors as she navigated the treacherous asteroid field.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, a journey measured not in days but in weeks of hyperspace travel.  The hum of the engines was a lullaby against the backdrop of the infinite, a constant reminder of the vastness of space and the fragile vessel carrying her through it.
