
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains crimson.  Her worn map, more frayed than reliable, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her as she pressed onward, driven by a quest to find the lost city of Eldoria and the rumored healing waters said to reside within its crumbling walls. The journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown propelled her forward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world teeming with unknown possibilities and dangers.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant reminder of the vast distances separating them from Earth, a planet shrinking in the rearview mirror of their galactic odyssey.  While the perils were different – rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system failure – the thrill of exploration, the uncharted territories, resonated with the same potent allure as any medieval quest.
