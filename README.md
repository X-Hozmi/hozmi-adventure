
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains a fiery orange.  Her journey from Canterbury to Constantinople was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in desolate villages, and constantly guarding against the ever-present threat of theft and violence. Yet, with each mile conquered, Elara felt a surge of exhilaration, the spirit of adventure burning bright in her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for colonization.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  But Eva, like Elara before her, embraced the risks, fueled by the insatiable human desire to explore and discover the wonders – and dangers – that lay beyond the known.
