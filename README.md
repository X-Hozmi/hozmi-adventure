
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secret to a potent healing balm for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast and unpredictable medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden hyperspace anomaly.  Warp jumps across galaxies were risky, fraught with the potential for temporal displacement or encounters with unpredictable celestial phenomena. But the potential discovery of surviving colonists, and the scientific breakthroughs awaiting them, fueled her unwavering resolve, charting a course through the breathtaking, and often terrifying, wonders of the far-flung future.
