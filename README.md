
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a daunting barrier on his journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  He carried with him only a worn map, a pouch of dried figs, and the unwavering hope of finding the legendary lost city, whispered about in taverns and sung in ballads – a journey fraught with peril, bandits, and the unforgiving wilderness itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a hypnotic drone masking the vastness of space and the weight of her mission.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the unknown alien lifeforms that might await – the thrill of exploration, the relentless pursuit of the uncharted, echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved the earth’s harsh landscapes.
