
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza and deliver a vital message, demanded unwavering courage and resilience. The journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking vistas, forged her into something stronger, a testament to the human spirit's indomitable will in the face of medieval uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering unknown alien life forms were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, filled her with a sense of awe and responsibility.  Her journey represented humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery and the unwavering hope for a future among the stars.
