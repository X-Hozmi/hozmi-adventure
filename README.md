
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Each day brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation fueled their weary bodies and spurred them across the vast, unforgiving landscape, their journey a testament to courage and unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and countless celestial bodies.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the stress of deep space travel became commonplace.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos held both terrifying beauty and immense danger, but the unwavering determination to find the lost colonists pushed Eva and her crew towards the distant stars, their journey a testament to human ingenuity and resilience.
