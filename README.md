
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all challenges he faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  The shimmering heat haze on the horizon held both promise and peril, a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the remote colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and the constant threat of warp core failure were all part of a galactic courier's daily routine.  The breathtaking cosmic panorama offered little comfort against the vast, indifferent expanse of space;  the loneliness of interstellar travel was a silent passenger on every journey.
