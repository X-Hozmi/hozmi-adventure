
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of sickness were less daunting than the reason for her journey: to find her estranged brother, rumored to be entangled in a crusade far to the east.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, was a potential clue, a whisper on the wind guiding her toward an unknown fate.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and perilous, stretched endlessly before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating hum of the ship's engines. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey requiring warp jumps across unimaginable distances and potential encounters with hostile alien life.  The vast expanse of space, a terrifying and wondrous tapestry of stars and cosmic phenomena, was both her playground and her prison, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration, even at the edge of known existence.
