
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over; rumors of a hidden monastery holding ancient healing texts spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery, weaving a tapestry of fear and exhilaration across her days.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting constant against the vast, inky blackness punctuated by distant nebulae. Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations, navigating uncharted asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were small prices to pay for the potential rewards of unlocking a new era for humankind.
