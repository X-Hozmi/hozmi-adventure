
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track.  Her mule, stubborn but steadfast, carried their meager supplies across the unforgiving landscape.  Rumors of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and jewels, fueled her journey, a dangerous gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing uncertainty of reaching her destination, a quest for fortune and glory that demanded everything she had.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, held both wonder and peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure were commonplace.  The rewards, however, were equally immense: the chance to discover new life, chart uncharted territories, and etch her name into the annals of interstellar exploration.
