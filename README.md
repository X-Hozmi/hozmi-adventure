
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, wound its way through sun-baked Provençal fields, then up into the rugged Alps, their snow-capped peaks piercing a sky often bruised with the threat of storms.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the promise of the exotic spices and silks of the Orient fueled our onward push, a relentless quest for fortune and adventure across a vast and unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the void, a tiny speck against the breathtaking grandeur of a nebula painted across the cosmos.  We are bound for Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, a journey that spans light years and countless celestial bodies.  The dangers are different now – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  But the thrill of exploration, the insatiable human hunger to discover the unknown, burns as bright as any medieval knight’s yearning for glory.
