
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving terrain, each sunrise bringing new challenges and the tantalizing promise – or terrifying possibility – of what lay beyond the next horizon.  He carried with him only his wits, a rusty sword, and the unwavering hope that fueled his relentless westward push.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology far exceeding anything known to the Galactic Federation.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll pirates, Elara and her crew relied on advanced technology and unwavering courage to overcome the vast distances and unimaginable dangers that separated them from their goal. The cosmos itself felt alive, a breathtaking tapestry of wonder and peril, as the *Starseeker* leaped across the light-years.
