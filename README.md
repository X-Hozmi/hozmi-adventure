
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her and her small band of travelers.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled their weary bodies and kept their spirits high, a stark contrast to the mundane lives they'd left behind.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with unmapped asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Advanced technology mitigated some of the danger, but the vastness of space, the sheer loneliness of the void, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes demanded courage and skill beyond measure. The galactic frontier beckoned, promising both untold riches and certain death for those foolhardy enough to seek its secrets.
