
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the ever-present aroma of sweat and fear.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and past villages haunted by the whispers of the Black Death.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of bandits, starvation, or the creeping despair of his lonely journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Vast cosmic distances were now her battlefield, not muddy tracks.  The thrill of charting unmapped star systems, the adrenaline rush of navigating asteroid fields, and the intellectual challenge of deciphering alien signals far eclipsed the dangers of medieval travel.  Yet, the loneliness of space, the crushing weight of responsibility for her crew, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations were challenges as formidable as any Thomas had faced.
