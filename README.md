
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the plague stalked the land like a phantom. Yet, with every creak of the saddle and each distant church bell, her spirit soared. This arduous trek across the continent wasn't just a pilgrimage; it was an adventure that etched itself into her soul, a testament to human resilience against a backdrop of breathtaking beauty and unimaginable hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions was commonplace; the vastness of space held both wonder and danger in equal measure.  This wasn't merely interstellar travel; it was a frontier expedition, a bold foray into the unknown, driven by the insatiable human hunger to explore and discover the secrets held within the cosmic tapestry, a journey far exceeding the wildest medieval dreams.
