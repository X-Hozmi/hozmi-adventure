
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was a tapestry woven with hardship: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and nights spent shivering under a meagre blanket of stars. Each sunrise brought new challenges, yet also the exhilarating thrill of pushing beyond the familiar, the unwavering hope fueling her steps forward despite the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of a thousand burning suns.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the peril of uncharted gravitational fields and hostile alien encounters.  While the comforts of advanced technology cushioned some of the harshness, the vastness of space instilled a similar awe and sense of intrepid exploration as Elara's medieval journey, a testament to humanity's timeless yearning to venture beyond the known.
