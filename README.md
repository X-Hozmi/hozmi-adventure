
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey ahead.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the distant sea, my ultimate destination.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed like a malevolent specter, yet the lure of the unknown, the promise of discovery beyond the familiar fields of my birth, propelled me onward. Each sunrise revealed a new tapestry of rolling hills, rugged mountains, and bustling medieval towns, each encounter a potential adventure or peril.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was the soundtrack to my interstellar voyage.  Instead of muddy tracks, I navigated nebulae painted across the cosmic canvas.  The dangers weren't bandits, but gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids threatening to tear my ship apart.  The whispers of plague were replaced by the static hiss of alien radio signals, promising contact or chaos.  But the thrill remained, that same potent cocktail of fear and excitement, the irresistible pull towards the uncharted territories of the cosmos.  Each jump through hyperspace delivered me to a new star system, teeming with life both familiar and utterly alien.
