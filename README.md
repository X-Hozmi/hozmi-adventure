The trail, a barely discernible path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the mud and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through him.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister – was a perilous journey fraught with danger, but the thought of her pale face spurred him on.  He pressed onward, his heart a drum against his ribs, into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts were commonplace, but the true thrill lay in the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a constant reminder of her own fragility, and yet, fueled her intrepid spirit to explore the furthest reaches of the galaxy.
