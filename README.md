
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns – of shimmering silks in distant Samarkand, of spices that burned the tongue, and of a mythical city lost amongst the towering peaks of the Himalayas.  Each creak of the saddle, each stumble of the mule, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest for fortune, or perhaps just glory, pushed him relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting thrum against the vast, inky blackness of space.  But the journey wasn't without its perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a calculated risk.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories across the cosmos, fueled her ambition, a legacy far grander than any medieval quest.
