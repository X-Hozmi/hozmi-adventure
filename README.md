
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged castle of Martel.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the urgency of her mission spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with unknown dangers, from rogue asteroids to unpredictable wormholes.  The solitude of interstellar travel was a different kind of hardship than Elara's, but the thrill of discovery and the weight of responsibility were as keenly felt, echoing the spirit of adventure across the vast gulf of time.
