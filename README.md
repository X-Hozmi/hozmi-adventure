
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage of penance and desperate hope, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Yet, with every sunrise, a stubborn resolve burned within her, fueled by the whispers of miracle and the relentless beat of her own heart.  Each day brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new test of endurance – a true medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship a tiny speck amidst colossal cosmic wonders.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a logistical marvel, a testament to humanity's relentless push beyond the known.  Wormhole jumps, fraught with unpredictable gravitational shifts and the constant threat of spatial anomalies, were the bread and butter of interstellar travel. The crew faced not bandits, but rogue asteroids and the chilling emptiness of space itself.  But the potential rewards – the discovery of new life, new resources, new knowledge – outweighed any risk, fueling the relentless pursuit of exploration across the vast, uncharted expanse.
