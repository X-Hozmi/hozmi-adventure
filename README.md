
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and murky forests teeming with bandits. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and constantly watching for the predatory eyes lurking in the shadows.  The thrill of the unknown, the constant test of their resilience, fueled their weary bodies and resolute spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula, its iridescent hues painting the cockpit in shifting colours.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps were risky, navigating asteroid fields a constant dance with destruction, and communication with Earth a faint whisper across unimaginable distances. But the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover the colony's fate, and the promise of discovering new life forms propelled them forward.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held them captive in its awe-inspiring embrace.
