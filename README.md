
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vastness of the cosmos, while beautiful, was equally terrifying, a constant reminder of the perilous distances separating her from her destination.
