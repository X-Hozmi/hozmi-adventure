
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Venice, the salt spray still clinging to our roughspun tunics.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps, through treacherous passes guarded by snow and bandits alike.  Rumors of mythical creatures and forgotten kingdoms fueled our weary steps, each sunrise revealing a new vista of untamed wilderness, each sunset painting the sky with the hues of our hopes and fears. We carried with us only the essentials:  a worn map, a handful of gold, and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The vast expanse of the cosmos stretched before us, a tapestry of nebulae and distant galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating political intrigue amongst the diverse alien races proved a challenge far exceeding the dangers of any earthly wilderness. Yet, the potential rewards – a new home, untold discoveries – spurred us onward, through the inky blackness between worlds.
