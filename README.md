Her meager pack held only essential supplies and the tattered map guiding her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.

But the allure of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting new territories and discovering alien life, overshadowed the risks.  The cosmos was their frontier, and the 'Stardust Drifter' their intrepid vessel.
