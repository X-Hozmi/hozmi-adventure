
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Castile, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of Eldoria, of unimaginable wealth and healing magic, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel-like planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  Yet, the responsibility of sustaining life on a new world, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the thrill of interstellar exploration spurred her onward, a modern knight errant in a galaxy far, far away.
