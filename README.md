
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled in the shadow of the Pyrenees, said to hold the secret to a forgotten healing balm.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the whispered promise of salvation fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a small victory in her perilous pilgrimage.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas swirling around her ship like a celestial serpent.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals to the distant colony of Aethelred, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with dangers unseen.  Pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were just a few of the hazards she faced in her galactic trek. Yet, the thought of life on Aethelred, and the knowledge her cargo would save countless lives, spurred her onward across the vast emptiness of space.
