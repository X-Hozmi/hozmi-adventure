
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across the treacherous mountain passes, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from easy.  Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies tested her resilience. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of ancient wonders, and the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a testament to the human spirit's enduring capacity for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Nova' piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was a dance with swirling nebulae and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a gamble with the fabric of spacetime itself.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journey; yet, the human desire to explore, to push beyond known boundaries, remained a constant, echoing through the ages.
