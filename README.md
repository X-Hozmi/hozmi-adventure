
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the rutted track.  Her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was far from over, the journey a tapestry woven with the vibrant threads of bustling market towns, the stark terror of bandit ambushes, and the quiet beauty of star-dusted nights spent huddled around crackling fires. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of sickness – but also the promise of new encounters and breathtaking landscapes that fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but interplanetary voyages still held a potent blend of excitement and peril.  Jax's mission to the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f demanded precise calculations, a steady hand, and the courage to face the unknown – both the wonders of alien ecosystems and the lurking dangers of unpredictable wormholes. The vastness of space, however, dwarfed even the most formidable challenges.
