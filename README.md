
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crests another sun-baked hill, the spires of the distant city of Aloria shimmering like a mirage.  His journey has been fraught with peril – bandits ambushing narrow mountain passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered promise of a lost artifact, said to grant its possessor unimaginable power, fuels his relentless pursuit, each sunrise a renewed pledge to reach Aloria, no matter the cost.  The rough-hewn map clutched in his hand is his only guide through the untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck amidst cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source on the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional meteor shower and the ever-present hum of the ship's engines, is a different kind of wilderness, equally unforgiving.  But with a crack team of specialists at her side and the galaxy's fate potentially hanging in the balance,  Eva presses onward, her sights set on the distant planet, a beacon of hope or potential destruction.
