
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred him on, the imagined gleam of gold a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Empire, Elara and her crew faced dangers as formidable as any medieval knight.  The vastness of space, however, offered a different kind of thrill, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders that spurred them toward their distant, uncertain destination.
