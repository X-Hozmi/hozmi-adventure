
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life in the fabled city of Byzantium.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and adventure.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey across the medieval world, yet the promise of distant horizons fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien phenomena was routine for a seasoned explorer like Eva, but the sheer scale of the cosmos, the endless possibilities and dangers it held, never ceased to inspire awe. The galaxy was her playground, a vast expanse waiting to be charted, a testament to human ambition and the unyielding quest for discovery in the distant future.
