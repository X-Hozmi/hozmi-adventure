
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape, carrying the scent of pine and the distant, unsettling howl of wolves.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, with each sunrise, his resolve hardened, fueled by the image of his sister's pale face.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant, swirling colours of cosmic dust painted the viewport as she charted a course to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held its own dangers: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But Lyra, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for discovery, pressed on, guided by the hope of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, and the allure of the unknown.
