
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the known world.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of Ys spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago. Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges unimaginable to medieval travelers, yet the spirit of adventure – the relentless pursuit of the unknown – remained the same.
