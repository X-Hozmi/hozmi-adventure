
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the western sea.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey, but the whispered tales of Ys, a city of unimaginable wealth and wonder, fueled his relentless pursuit.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and unpredictable gravitational fields.  The ship's AI, a sassy construct named HALIX, warned of approaching spatial anomalies, its synthesized voice a counterpoint to the hum of the warp drive.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, held the allure of endless exploration, but the price of failure was oblivion, a chilling reminder in the cold, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
