
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a vital message for the King – a desperate plea from a besieged city.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightens the tension of her solitary journey.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions, testing her courage and resilience as she pushes towards her uncertain destination.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, holds both danger and the faintest promise of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the hostile K'tharr homeworld, a planet light-years away.  His crew, a ragtag bunch of mercenaries and explorers, faces the perils of uncharted space – from rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies to the cunning and ruthless K'tharr themselves. The galaxy's vastness, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and nebulae, is a testament to the boundless possibilities and equally boundless dangers of interstellar travel.
