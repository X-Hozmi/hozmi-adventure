
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices, a dangerous cargo destined for the far-off Hanseatic League cities.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, brought a fresh surge of adrenaline.  Bandits lurked, and the treacherous mountain passes promised hardship and hunger.  Yet, the lure of untold riches, and the thrill of facing the unknown, propelled him ever closer to his destination, a journey as much about survival as it was about profit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable worlds for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril; unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life forms.  But the possibility of discovering new civilizations, of charting a course into the ultimate frontier, fueled her every decision, making the risks worthwhile.
