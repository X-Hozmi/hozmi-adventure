
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that prowled these desolate heights. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance against the elements and the unknown, but the hope in her heart fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfire" Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay the Andromeda galaxy, a destination shrouded in both mystery and potential riches.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and encounters with unknown alien species were commonplace hazards on her interstellar trade routes.  The vast emptiness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a constant threat of the unpredictable – a broken hyperdrive, a pirate ambush, or even the silent, creeping dread of cosmic loneliness.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred her onwards, a cosmic adventurer charting the unmapped stars.
