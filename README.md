
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, a mere suggestion of a path through the dense Ardennes forest, wound ever deeper into the unknown.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow stretching long in the dappled sunlight, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his journey to the distant Holy Land, a pilgrimage spurred by faith and a thirst for the unknown, his only maps the stars above and the whispered legends of fellow travelers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, a canvas of shimmering gases and distant galaxies, held both wonder and danger.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien civilizations tested her skills and courage, as she pushed the boundaries of human exploration, driven by the insatiable human need to discover what lies beyond the next star.
