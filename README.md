
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, guided his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to find the lost monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of ancient secrets, pushed him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship swallowed by the cosmic expanse decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily occurrence.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held dangers far beyond anything Reginald could have imagined. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of the lost colony, fueled her journey across the uncharted galaxies.
