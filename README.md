
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing the precarious route to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on his quest for the legendary lost city, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold riches and glory – or a swift, unceremonious end in the unforgiving wilderness.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset a gnawing fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space was a constant presence, a beautiful but deadly backdrop to her mission.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her skill and resolve. The prize, however, was a universe of possibilities, a future unbound by the limitations of a single solar system.
