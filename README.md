
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than she was – her only guide to the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Black Forest, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses; danger lurked in every shadow, from bandits to wild beasts, yet the hope of healing spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void, leaving behind the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, rumored to harbor a rare crystalline mineral vital to her people’s survival.  The journey was fraught with potential hazards – asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the cold emptiness of space. But Rexa, hardened by years of interstellar travel, steered her ship towards the unknown, fueled by a resolve as vast as the cosmos itself.
