
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of bandit activity that haunted his every step.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister – was a perilous journey through unforgiving landscapes, fraught with the dangers of wild beasts, lawless men, and the unpredictable whims of nature. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora but fraught with equally alien dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the journey was far from easy.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields, dealing with volatile alien encounters, and the constant hum of the ship's hyperdrive were a testament to the risks of interstellar exploration.  The universe, vast and beautiful, was also a treacherous mistress.
