
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to find the lost monastery of Sanctus, rumored to hold the key to ending a devastating plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation all loomed larger than the distant, promised salvation.  The journey itself was an adventure, a test of her resilience and faith, far more challenging than any treasure she might find.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the legendary Xylan crystals, a power source capable of ending galactic energy wars. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr, whose bio-ships stalked the void, was a constant dance between life and death.  Unlike the medieval travelers, Eva’s challenges weren't limited to the physical realm;  the vastness of space bred a different kind of loneliness, a constant awareness of her own fragility against the breathtaking indifference of the cosmos.  But the allure of the crystals, and the hope of peace, fueled her perilous voyage.
