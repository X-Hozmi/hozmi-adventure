
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, the scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the crisp mountain air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing herbs.  Each creaking step of her journey was a gamble against bandits, treacherous paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation, a true test of her resilience and faith.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across a cluster of uncharted planets.  The jump drives hummed, a constant reminder of the immense distances separating them from home and the unpredictable dangers lurking in unexplored systems – hostile alien life, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  The galaxy was their canvas, but survival was the ultimate masterpiece.
