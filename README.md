
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate flight.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed them like a shroud. Each creak of their weary horses’ harnesses, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of fear and adrenaline through them. The promise of salvation at Canterbury was a distant star, barely visible through the storm of their perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport were breathtaking, but the real danger lay in the unknown – uncharted systems, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with promise, yet guarded by treacherous cosmic currents and the secrets of a long-dead civilization.  The vastness of space was a breathtaking canvas, but survival demanded a sharp eye and an even sharper instinct.
