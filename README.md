
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister, was a tapestry woven with hardship.  He’d dodged bandits, braved treacherous mountain passes, and relied on the kindness (and occasional suspicion) of strangers in countless villages. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the hope of Eldoria's healing magic fueled his weary steps, making the endless expanse of land before him feel less daunting, less endless.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unknown dangers.  Warp jumps hurled her ship across lightyears, each one a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely frontier, and the success of her mission rested not only on her piloting skills but also on her ability to navigate the complex political landscape of the intergalactic alliance.
