
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, a perilous journey to retrieve a stolen relic from a treacherous warlord nestled deep within the Carpathian Mountains, had already claimed two of his men.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the relic in his mind's eye, and the promise of glory, fueled his relentless onward march.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a breathtaking distraction from the mission at hand. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate vessels was routine for her hardened crew, but the unknown dangers of a new planet, including alien lifeforms, held a thrilling unpredictability. The vast expanse of space offered both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of humanity's smallness against the immensity of the cosmos.
