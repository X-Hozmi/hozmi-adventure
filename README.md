
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King, a secret route whispered only between trusted messengers.  Each sunrise brought the peril of bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present threat of disease, but the weight of her responsibility spurred her onward.  The vastness of the land, punctuated by crumbling castles and bustling market towns, was both a challenge and a canvas for her courageous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace lever, his starship leaping across the inky black between Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy.  His mission: to recover a lost artifact said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory ships of the Kryll Empire was all in a day's work for this seasoned spacefarer.  The cosmic expanse, filled with nebulae painted across the void and the cold, distant gleam of uncountable stars, held the promise of untold riches – and equally unimaginable dangers.
