
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days blurred into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, perilous river crossings, and nights spent huddled around meager fires under a vast, indifferent sky. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the hope of finding salvation in the distant shimmering mirage of Eldoria.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden wormhole decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva relied on her wits and advanced technology to keep her crew safe. The vast emptiness of space pressed in, a stark contrast to the vibrant, alien landscapes that briefly materialized during their perilous hyperspace jumps, offering glimpses of a universe both terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful.
