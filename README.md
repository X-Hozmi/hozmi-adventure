
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his mount onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a swirling ochre testament to their arduous journey across the unforgiving plains.  Rumors of a lost city, glittering with gold and ancient magic, fueled their relentless pursuit, a siren song echoing through the parched landscape.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in their quest for legendary riches and immortal glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, yet the journey to the Andromeda Galaxy was far from leisurely.  Pirate attacks, rogue asteroids, and the chilling emptiness of space were constant dangers.  But the lure of discovering a new habitable planet, a potential new home for humanity, outweighed the risks, a beacon guiding her through the infinite darkness.
