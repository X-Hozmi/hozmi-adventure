
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel contained more than just dried meat and meager coins; it held a map, rumored to lead to a lost monastery said to possess the mythical Sunstone.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the trials awaiting her on this perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unpredictable landscape and the even more unpredictable whims of fate.  The thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, the promise of adventure a bright spark against the grim reality of medieval life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potentially hostile alien life.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was all in a day's work for the seasoned explorer.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the dangers were far from diminished.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems, and the ever-present possibility of mechanical failure made every journey a test of skill, courage, and sheer luck.
