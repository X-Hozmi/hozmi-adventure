
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Ys, a siren's call whispering promises of untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown, the intoxicating allure of the legend, spurred her onwards, a solitary figure against the vast canvas of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian artifact, a device said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  Jagged asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were but minor inconveniences compared to the vastness of space and the limitless potential of discovery that lay before her.  The galaxy, a boundless ocean of stars, held her future.
