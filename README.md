Before him lay the treacherous Whispering Mountains, rumored to house mythical beasts and forgotten magic.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone, a jewel said to hold the very light of the kingdom, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the looming shadow of the Black Knight.
