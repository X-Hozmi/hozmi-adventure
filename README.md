
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the oppressive heat of the Provençal countryside.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the lost scroll of King Arthur. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends, and the promise of glory fueled his journey across the vast, untamed lands of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cutting a path through the cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were far grander – hostile alien encounters, gravitational anomalies threatening to crush her vessel, and the constant gnawing fear of the uncharted void.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien worlds, and the potential for groundbreaking discovery spurred her onwards through the unexplored galaxies.
