
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning mud and dust. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them forward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and the fleeting beauty of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the distant Xylos system and the burgeoning galactic federation.  Warp jumps were risky, pirate attacks frequent, and the alien landscapes of unexplored planets held both wonder and danger.  Yet, driven by a thirst for discovery and the promise of untold riches, Eva charted a course through unmapped regions of space, embracing the thrill of galactic exploration.
