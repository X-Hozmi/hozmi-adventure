
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold miraculous healing powers, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any map could depict. Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing her resilience and faith as she relied on the kindness of strangers and her own sharp wit to survive the unforgiving medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos reflected in the viewport of his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey requiring months of hyperspace travel and perilous encounters with asteroid fields and unknown space anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than Elara's medieval world, but the unwavering human spirit, the desire to explore the unknown, burned just as brightly within him as it did within her.
