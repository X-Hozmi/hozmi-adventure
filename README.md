
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the unforgiving sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, where a wrong turn could mean death, and every encounter, friend or foe, held the potential to alter the course of her destiny.  The whispers of Zerzura's riches and magic spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, dodging asteroid fields and the occasional rogue pirate vessel, was a far cry from the dusty trails of Elara's era.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown remained the same.  Each jump to a new star system was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vastness of space, where faulty calculations could mean oblivion. The allure of unexplored planets, each potentially harboring wonders beyond human comprehension, fueled her relentless pursuit of discovery across the galaxy.
