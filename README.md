Sir Gareth, his armor heavy beneath the midday sun, squinted at the horizon, his gaze searching for the rumored oasis promised by the Bedouin guide.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation in the unforgiving landscape.
