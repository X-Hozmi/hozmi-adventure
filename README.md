
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had become an adventure far exceeding expectations.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and unexpected storms had tested their mettle and their supplies.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista – from the rolling hills of the Cotswolds to the stark beauty of the Pennines.  The reward, they hoped, was not just spiritual solace, but the tales they would carry home, etched in their memories as deeply as the scars on their hands.


Centuries later,  Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The journey across galaxies was measured not in days or weeks, but in years, a constant hum of the hyperdrive the only companion to the vast, star-dusted emptiness.  Each jump into hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.   The reward, should she find the colonists, would be the salvation of a species, a triumph against the infinite loneliness of space.
