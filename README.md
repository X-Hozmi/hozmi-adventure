His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of saving his kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown, yet the thrill of the journey, the possibility of glory, spurred him onwards.  He rode towards the horizon, a lone figure against the vast, untamed landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colors and celestial bodies, filled her with awe and a sense of profound loneliness. Yet, the promise of discovery, of establishing a new human foothold amongst the stars, fueled her ambition and kept her ever vigilant on her journey across the galaxy.
