
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she crests the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offers little comfort against the looming uncertainty.  Rumors of a mythical city, lost to time and shrouded in legend, drive her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume her.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – navigating dense forests, fording raging rivers, and outsmarting the wily locals who guard their secrets jealously.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new human colony, is fraught with peril:  uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions roaming the interstellar black.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential to forge a new future among the stars, fuels her determination.  Each jump through hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite unknowns of the galaxy.
