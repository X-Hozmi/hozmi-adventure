
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Pyrenees, the biting wind a constant companion.  His quest: to reach the legendary lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of hope, fuelled by tales of Eldoria's untold riches and healing power, kept him pushing forward, one aching step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  Asteroids the size of mountains lurked in the darkness, while unpredictable wormholes threatened to swallow her ship whole.  Yet, the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos – the vibrant hues of nebulae and the silent majesty of distant galaxies – fueled her determination.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a small price to pay for the chance to explore the uncharted reaches of the universe and bring aid to those in need.
