
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled the air, a stark contrast to the rumors that haunted his journey: whispers of a mythical city of gold hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains, guarded by creatures of myth and shadowed by ancient curses.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and adventure, a constant reminder that survival, let alone fortune, depended on his wits and courage.  He carried little, but his spirit burned with a fervor that defied the harsh reality of the medieval world.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  The ship's AI, a soothing female voice, announced the jump to Proxima Centauri b in T-minus 30 seconds.  Eva adjusted her neural implant, the swirling cosmos a breathtaking backdrop to her solitary vigil.  She wasn't searching for gold, but for a new habitable world for humanity – a far more perilous quest than any medieval knight could ever imagine.  The vastness of space, filled with untold wonders and unimaginable dangers, was her battlefield, and the success of her mission, the future of her people, rested on her shoulders.
