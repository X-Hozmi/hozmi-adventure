
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of their saddle, each clop of their horses' hooves, echoed the uncertainty of their journey.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in their tales. Their adventure wasn't about gold alone, but the thrill of facing the unknown, pushing the boundaries of their world, and forging a legend to be sung around campfires for generations to come.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey fraught with unstable wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos unfolding outside her viewport.  While technology lessened the physical dangers, the mental strain of interstellar travel, the loneliness of space, and the unknown challenges of encountering alien civilizations presented a different kind of adventure, a test of courage and ingenuity that pushed the boundaries of human exploration to the very edge of the known universe.
