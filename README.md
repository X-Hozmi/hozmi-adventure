
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny spark against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly colonized planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both opportunity and peril.  Facing unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien factions, and the constant threat of equipment failure, Eva knew the challenges were immense.  But the promise of a new frontier, a chance to forge a future among the stars, drove her across the light-years.
