
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small company pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing their courage, loyalty, and the strength of their bonds.  Their horses' hooves beat a rhythm against the hard earth, a relentless counterpoint to the whisper of their hopes and fears.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer*, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The risks were cosmic:  uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present danger of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. Yet, the lure of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fueled their daring voyage.
