
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara's small caravan struggled onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Zerzura, had already claimed two pack animals and tested the limits of their endurance.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the endless expanse of unforgiving terrain threatened to swallow them whole.  Yet, the whispered promise of Zerzura, a city of gold and untold wonders, fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst swirling nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields.  The vast distances were a constant challenge, the loneliness of deep space a weight on her crew's shoulders.  But the thrill of discovery, the potential for finding new life, and the unexplored wonders awaiting them in the cosmos outweighed the inherent risks of interstellar travel.
