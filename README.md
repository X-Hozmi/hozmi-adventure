
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood clinging to his sword.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Elias, rumored to hold the cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each ford across a swollen river, each wary glance at the darkening forest, represented a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unforgiving terrain itself. His journey was a tapestry woven from hardship and hope, a testament to the enduring human spirit in a brutal age.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels from the Orion Arm was child's play compared to deciphering the enigmatic signals emanating from the colony's last transmission. Each jump through hyperspace, each calculated course correction, was a leap of faith into the vast unknown.  The cosmos, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its indifference, offered Elara a boundless adventure where the stakes were nothing less than the survival of her people.
