
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, offered little comfort against the looming peaks and the gnawing uncertainty of her journey.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her perilous trek across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise bringing fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets and galaxies, but the vastness of space remained a constant, humbling reminder of humanity's smallness.  His mission: to retrieve a vital mineral from the ice planet of Nird, a world teeming with bizarre, alien lifeforms and unforgiving weather patterns.  Every jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering pirate fleets or encountering gravitational anomalies, but the potential reward, the chance to secure his crew's future, outweighed the dangers. The universe was their playground, and their destiny hung in the balance.
