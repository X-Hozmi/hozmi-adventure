
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate gamble for a better life in the rumored fertile lands of the east.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the overgrown fields, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at their heels. Yet, with every sunrise, the unwavering promise of adventure, of escape, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been perilous, a gamble against the unpredictable warp currents.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, held their breath as the ship shuddered, the vastness of space a constant reminder of their vulnerability.  But the lure of undiscovered planets, of alien civilizations and untold riches, far outweighed the risks.  The cosmos, a limitless frontier, beckoned with the siren song of adventure.
