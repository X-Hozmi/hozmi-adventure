
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the endless expanse of desert threatened dehydration.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the whispered legends of Zerzura's hidden riches and ancient secrets spurred her on, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of intergalactic travel permits, but the promise of discovering a new habitable planet, Xylos IV, outweighed any annoyance.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant stars and the hum of the ship's engines, instilled a sense of awe and isolation unlike anything experienced on Earth.  The adventure lay not just in the unknown landscapes, but in the sheer audacity of crossing the unfathomable distances between worlds.
