
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered stories of Zerzura, and the love for his sister, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva relied on her instincts and advanced technology to overcome the vast distances between star systems. The weight of galactic responsibility, and the hope of finding a peaceful solution, propelled her ship across the black canvas of space.
