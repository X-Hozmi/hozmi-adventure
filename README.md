
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with salted meat and meager coin, spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils that lay between him and his desperate hope. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the vast and unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations in slower ships.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own dangers, from unpredictable spatial anomalies to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile place among the stars.
