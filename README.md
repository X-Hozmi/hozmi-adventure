
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the next hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume him faster than any disease.  He pressed onward, spurred by hope and the unwavering belief that his journey, fraught with peril, held the key to salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy storms was a constant, exhausting battle against the unforgiving vastness of space.  Yet, the thought of the colonists, facing starvation and disease, fueled her resolve, making the perilous journey a necessary sacrifice for the greater good of humanity's expansion among the stars.
