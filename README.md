
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both adventure and mortal danger, a stark reminder that survival in this unforgiving age demanded courage and cunning in equal measure.  The scent of woodsmoke and the distant call of a hawk spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and potentially fraught with encounters with unknown alien species – some friendly, others possibly hostile.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery beyond human comprehension, a gamble on the future of their species balanced precariously against the risks of interstellar travel.
