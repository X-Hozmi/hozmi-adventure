
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of oxen and weary men, crests the windswept pass.  Below, the valley unfolds, a tapestry of emerald fields and silver rivers, promising respite from the relentless sun. But the rumors of bandit raids linger like a shadow, a constant companion on our journey from the bustling port of Marseilles to the mythical Silk Road cities of the East. Each creak of the wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens our senses, the thrill of the unknown interwoven with the ever-present threat of danger.  The destination promises riches and glory, but the path is paved with uncertainty and peril.

Centuries hence, the stars are our canvas.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar travel, cuts through the void, leaving a shimmering trail in its wake.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and potentially encountering alien civilizations.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby, masking the vastness and the unknown that awaits us. Every jump through hyperspace holds the promise of breathtaking discoveries, but also the risk of unforeseen dangers – rogue asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, or perhaps, something far more sinister lurking in the inky blackness between worlds.
