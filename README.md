
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a ragged tapestry of weary men and laden pack animals, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we skirt crumbling ruins and navigate treacherous mountain passes, ever vigilant against bandits, storms, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume us.  Each sunset brings a renewed sense of trepidation and hope, fuelled by whispered legends of untold riches and the promise of a life beyond the hardship of our journey.  The road is long, but the allure of the unknown propels us forward.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship humming with the energy of a thousand suns, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a region whispered to hold the secrets of faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes, our crew faces dangers beyond human comprehension.  But the pursuit of knowledge, the chance to expand the boundaries of human understanding, is a reward worth the risk, a thrilling adventure amongst the breathtaking tapestry of the cosmos.
