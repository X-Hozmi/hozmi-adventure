
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We brave bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, navigate treacherous mountain passes where the air thins and the wind howls like a banshee, and rely on the kindness – or grudging hospitality – of isolated villages for sustenance.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of our courage and resilience.  The whispered tales of Samarkand’s riches fuel our onward march, a shimmering beacon in the vast and unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts a lonely path through the nebula of Xylos.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  Faster-than-light travel is a miracle, yet the journey is still fraught with peril.  Cosmic radiation threatens our shields, asteroid fields demand precise navigation, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace creates pockets of temporal distortion.  But the crew, a multinational team of scientists and explorers, presses on, driven by the hope of finding a new home amidst the breathtaking panorama of a thousand swirling galaxies. The vastness of space is a daunting, beautiful frontier; the future of humankind hangs in the balance.
