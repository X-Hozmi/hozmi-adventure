
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and meager supplies, bounced against her hip.  This journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of sickness hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each aching mile, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, the whispered legends of the holy city a siren's call in the vast wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of a thousand shimmering suns.  The jump to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was risky, traversing uncharted space rife with gravitational anomalies and pirate fleets.  But the potential reward – unlocking interstellar travel for humanity – outweighed the danger.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held a different kind of adventure than Elara’s, but the spirit of exploration burned just as brightly within Eva's heart.
