
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation was a relentless companion.  Yet, the hope of healing fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of another step closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst the cosmic grandeur.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was a calculated risk, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the unknown dangers that lurked in uncharted sectors.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, outweighed the inherent risks.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, stretched before them, a testament to human ambition and the enduring desire to explore.
