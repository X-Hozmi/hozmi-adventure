
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  My quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys, fueled my weary steps, the whispered tales of its wonders a beacon in the harsh realities of the journey.  The map, faded and torn, was my only guide through this unforgiving landscape, promising both riches and ruin.

Centuries later, the stars are my map.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we jump between galaxies, a kaleidoscope of nebulae flashing past the viewport.  My mission, to locate the lost colony of Xylos, is a perilous one, fraught with the dangers of uncharted space – hostile alien encounters, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness. Each jump is a gamble, but the hope of finding my lost kin keeps me pressing forward, the cosmos my battlefield and the unknown my destination.
