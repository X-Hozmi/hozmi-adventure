
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless miles traversed across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and sung of by wandering bards.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each ford across a rushing river, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to the enduring human spirit in pursuit of the extraordinary.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Starseeker' through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic expedition.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days, but in weeks of hyperspace travel, punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the faint crackle of comms.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Thomas’s medieval trek, Eva faced different challenges – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms, and the crushing loneliness of vast interstellar distances.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential to expand human knowledge and reach for the stars, fueled her onward.
