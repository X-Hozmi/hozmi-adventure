Their journey across the kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from fording icy rivers to navigating dense, unfamiliar woodlands, yet the allure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to lie hidden in the far north, spurred them onward.
