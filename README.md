
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – and peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the whispered tales of Zerzura fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unmapped wormholes and the ever-present danger of rogue gravitational fields.  The cosmos, a breathtaking canvas of nebulas and distant galaxies, held untold wonders and immeasurable risks.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery propelled Lyra and her crew across the vast expanse of the universe.
