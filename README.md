
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales of spice and silks that fueled his journey eastward.  Each creak of the saddle, each ford across the swollen river, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the crowded towns. Yet, the allure of the unknown, of lands beyond his village, pushed him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of a thousand unseen stars.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a galaxy previously believed unreachable. The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a counterpoint to the silence of deep space.  Ahead lay the unknown, the possibility of new worlds, of civilizations both wondrous and terrifying. But for Eva, the thrill of exploration, the challenge of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, made the risks worthwhile.
