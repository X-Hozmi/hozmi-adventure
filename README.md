
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague, the scent of woodsmoke and roasting meat a stark contrast to the biting wind whipping across the Charles Bridge.  Ahead lay the long, arduous journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurked in the shadowy forests, disease stalked the crowded trade routes, and the unpredictable whims of nature – sudden storms, flooded rivers – threatened to derail my quest for knowledge and fortune. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of apprehension, yet also of thrilling expectation; for what wonders and hardships lay beyond the next hill?

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge between galaxies.  Looking out at the swirling nebulae, a breathtaking tapestry of colours unseen on any Earth-bound canvas, I felt a kinship with those medieval travellers. The dangers were different – void storms, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate raids – but the underlying spirit remained the same.  The universe stretched before us, an endless expanse of exploration, each jump to warp speed a leap into the unknown, a testament to human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of the next frontier.
