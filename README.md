
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The muddy track snaked through a forest haunted by whispers of brigands and worse – mythical creatures said to guard the ancient stones beyond.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing King. The journey promised hardship, danger, and the uncertain glory of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the shimmering expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the predatory void-faring Krakens, she pursued a signal – a faint whisper of a lost colony clinging to survival on a distant, uncharted world.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views, but the vastness of space held perils as real as any medieval forest. The promise of discovery, however,  fueled her onward, her courage a beacon in the endless black.
