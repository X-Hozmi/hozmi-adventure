
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track wound through a forest thick with mist and the hushed whispers of unseen things.  Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, peril, and the unknown – bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable whims of nature all stood between them and their goal.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, treacherous wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders seeking to plunder her ship's advanced technology. But the allure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories among the stars, far outweighed the risks for Eva and her crew.
