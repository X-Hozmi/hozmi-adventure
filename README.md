
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining with the weight of his pack, urged his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate moors, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperately overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space remained a daunting challenge.  The risk of encountering hostile alien life, navigational anomalies, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel were constant reminders of the immense gamble she had undertaken in pursuit of humanity's future.
