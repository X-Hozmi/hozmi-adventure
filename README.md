
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  The journey was arduous, a relentless test of her physical and mental fortitude, but the hope of Eldoria fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, *The Wanderer*, sliced through the inky black of intergalactic space.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was a daily routine, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperately overcrowded Earth.  The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, was also isolating, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the uncaring indifference of the cosmos.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for finding a new home among the stars, spurred her crew onward.
