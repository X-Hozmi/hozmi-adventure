
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and the tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope burning in her heart, a fierce ember against the chill wind, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay the unexplored Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and battling the crushing loneliness of deep space were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of discovery, the potential for unlocking secrets that could rewrite galactic history. The journey was perilous, but the promise of the unknown was a siren's call she couldn't resist.
