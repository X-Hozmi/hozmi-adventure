
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the rugged, unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Each sunrise brought the chilling beauty of a new valley, each sunset the gnawing fear of bandits or starvation.  Her worn leather satchel held not just supplies, but the weight of her family's desperate hope—a pilgrimage to a rumored healing shrine across the mountains, a journey fraught with peril but offering a chance at salvation. The whispers of ancient ruins and forgotten trails fueled her resolve, the ever-present threat a constant companion in her perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Nebulae painted cosmic masterpieces across her viewport, while the hum of the hyperdrive resonated deep within the vessel's hull.  Her mission: a desperate search for a new habitable world for a dying colony. The vastness of space offered both breathtaking wonder and chilling isolation, each jump to a new system a gamble against uncharted dangers and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena.  The weight of her people’s survival rested on her shoulders, a burden as heavy as the cosmos itself.
