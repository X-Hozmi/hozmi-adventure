
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach their elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia for slower vessels.  The vastness of space held its own terrors; rogue asteroids threatened to shatter their hull, unpredictable gravitational forces tossed them about like toys, and the constant hum of the warp drive strained every component of the ship.  But the promise of new worlds, undiscovered civilizations, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration fuelled her crew's relentless drive across the cosmic ocean.
