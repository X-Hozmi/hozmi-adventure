
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The journey across the ravaged countryside had been brutal, bandits a constant threat, the weather a capricious tormentor.  But the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, fueled his relentless pace. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet each sunset brought him closer to his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks made the journey perilous, but Eva, a veteran spacer with nerves of steel, navigated the hazards with a calm precision.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both the promise of untold discoveries and the chilling possibility of utter annihilation.
