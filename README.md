
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the treacherous Black Forest, promising both peril and untold riches. Whispers of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient texts and untold gold, fueled his relentless journey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or monstrous beast, but the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onward towards his destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a colony that vanished without a trace.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, was both exhilarating and terrifying.  Nebulae shifted like iridescent dreams, while the silent hum of the hyperdrive was the only constant companion on her perilous interstellar voyage to find the lost colony.
