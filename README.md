
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the fire of determination burned brighter than any fear, fueled by the desperate need to reach her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s swirling colours.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes was a daily challenge, but the thought of reuniting with her lost people, of discovering the secrets held within the enigmatic Xylosan artifacts, outweighed any danger.  The vastness of space was daunting, yet the promise of discovery and reunion ignited an unyielding spirit of adventure.
