
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and meager coin.  Each creak of her saddle was a counterpoint to the rhythmic clop of hooves, a soundtrack to her perilous journey to the rumored healing springs of the Pyrenees.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of war echoed from distant mountains, but the unwavering glint of hope in her eyes burned brighter than any threat.  She sought not gold or glory, but a chance to save her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* cut through the inky void, a tiny spark against the backdrop of a swirling nebula. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space held breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, from rogue asteroids to sentient, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, Ryla pressed on, propelled by the same unwavering spirit of exploration that drove Elara across the medieval landscape, the thirst for discovery outweighing the fear of the unknown.
