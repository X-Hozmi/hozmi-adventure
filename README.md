
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried figs and water skins; it held the hope of reaching Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones in her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse vegetation, spoke of both danger and possibility.  Bandits, disease, and the unforgiving terrain were ever-present threats, but the lure of the vibrant capital, and perhaps a chance at a better life, fueled her onward.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive humming a song of unimaginable power.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic dust and incandescent gas, was merely a waypoint on her journey across the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a task fraught with peril in the vast, uncharted expanse of space.  Alien encounters, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the constant threat of engine failure were all part of the arduous, exhilarating odyssey.
