His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister.

The vast, unknowable expanse of space, teeming with both wonder and peril, held the key to the colony’s fate and the future of humanity, pushing Eva and her crew to the limits of their courage and ingenuity.
