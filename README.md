
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – a precious cargo for the monastery awaiting her in the distant valley.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit attack or wild animal encounter.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of sustenance for the starving faithful propelled her onward, the stark beauty of the landscape both a comfort and a constant reminder of the harshness of her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped between galaxies. The shimmering void pulsed with nebulae, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the bridge.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a signal barely a whisper across the immeasurable expanse.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading space pirates were routine hazards.  But the true danger lay in the unknown – the potential for discoveries that could shatter existing galactic order, or the chilling prospect of finding Xylos consumed by an ancient, unforeseen enemy.
