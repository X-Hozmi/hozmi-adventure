
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudged through the mud, the chill October wind biting at their faces.  Their journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was proving far more arduous than the tales of valiant knights suggested.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with autumn rains presented treacherous crossings, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as formidable as any Saracen. Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of glory and redemption, spurred them onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and enduring the unpredictable warp jumps were all part of a galactic courier's routine. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of thrill – the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies and the exhilarating possibility of discovering something entirely new, something that could rewrite history.
