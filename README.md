
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for a village ravaged by famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of potential peril: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope etched on the faces of her people spurred her onward, transforming the arduous journey into a pilgrimage of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  The ship hummed with the energy of hyperspace, a stark contrast to the primitive methods of Elara's era. Yet, the dangers remained strikingly similar: the unknown lurked in the vast expanse of space, threatening both ship and crew with unseen anomalies and the unpredictable nature of traversing the cosmos.  The weight of responsibility, the hope for a successful return, were burdens shared across the centuries.
