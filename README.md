
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for a plague sweeping across the land.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, fueled their arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol system and the distant Kepler-186f.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields that threatened to obliterate her ship, unpredictable wormholes that warped space and time, and the ever-present fear of encountering hostile alien life. But the promise of galactic commerce, and the advancement of humanity, pushed her and her crew onward, across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
