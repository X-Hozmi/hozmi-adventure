
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie beyond the shifting sands of the Great Desert.

Yet, the lure of untold riches and the whispered secrets of Zerzura fueled his weary legs, propelling him ever deeper into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were mere child's play compared to the unknown dangers awaiting her – alien predators, hostile factions, and the chilling possibility that Kepler-186f held a secret far more terrifying than simple disappearance.  The cosmos held its breath as she plunged into the void.
