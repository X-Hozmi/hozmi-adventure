
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward. Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland, was fraught with peril.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, vast, unforgiving forests teeming with wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Their horses’ hooves pounded a rhythm of hope against the desolate landscape, a testament to their unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to contain a resource capable of solving the energy crisis plaguing the United Earth Federation.  Nebulae painted vibrant tapestries across the void, while the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive masked the dangers lurking in the black, a testament to the courage needed for interstellar exploration.
