
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zaragoza, a beacon of potential wealth and escape from the grinding poverty of her village.  Each creak of her cart, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or the brutal realities of medieval travel.  Yet, the whisper of adventure, the promise of a different life, pushed her onward, a resilient ember against the chilling winds of uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a course through unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The thrill of discovery, the awe-inspiring beauty of alien landscapes, and the ever-present danger of unknown celestial phenomena fueled her journey.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the vast, breathtaking unknown, a testament to human ambition and the enduring spirit of exploration.
