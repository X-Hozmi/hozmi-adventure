
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering serpent of pack animals and weary men, slogs through the mud of a nameless forest.  Each creak of the wagon wheels is a counterpoint to the nervous chatter of our guards, ever watchful for bandits or worse – the whispers of the forest itself.  Our destination:  the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the edge of the known world, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  We travel not for comfort, but for glory, for survival, and for the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, a gamble against the odds in a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries hence, the stars are our highway.  The *Starseeker*, a vessel of shimmering chrome and unimaginable power, leaps across the gulf between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the silent immensity of space.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds amidst swirling nebulae and the silent majesty of black holes.  The dangers are not bandits or wild beasts, but the crushing weight of gravity, the unpredictable whims of quantum physics, and the ever-present possibility of encountering something…else.  The adventure is not just geographic, but existential, a test of human courage against the vast, indifferent cosmos.
