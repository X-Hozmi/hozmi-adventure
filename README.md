
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide to the fabled Silk Road.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing uncertainty of finding food and shelter. Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of distant spices, silks, and the whispered legends of Cathay fuels her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel is a marvel, but cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions make every jump a gamble.  The vastness of space is breathtakingly beautiful, yet also terrifyingly lonely, a stark contrast to the vibrant, if dangerous, tapestry of human life she left behind on Earth.
