
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward.  The sun beat down on the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, the scent of wildflowers a faint counterpoint to the pervasive smell of sweat and dried mud.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery at Glastonbury, said to hold the secrets to healing a plague that ravaged her village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, transforming the arduous journey into a pilgrimage of faith and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, had been harrowing, the warp drive sputtering dangerously close to failure.  His crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and scientists, were on edge, their anticipation a volatile mix of excitement and apprehension.  The uncharted territory promised untold riches – scientific breakthroughs, new forms of life, perhaps even answers to humanity's greatest questions – but also held the grim potential of discovery's darker side.
