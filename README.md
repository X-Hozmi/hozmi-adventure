
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the whispers of a mythical beast guarding a mountain pass chilled her to the bone.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the lure of the fabled Sunstone, said to hold untold power, fueled her onward.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and rain, was her only guide in this vast, untamed land.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*, a nebula of swirling crimson and gold painting the void beyond.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the hazards of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  Unlike Elara's mule, the *Drifter* possessed advanced warp capabilities, yet the vastness of space instilled a similar sense of awe and peril.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of discovery or a deadly trap.
