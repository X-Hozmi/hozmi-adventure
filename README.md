
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, but the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking but treacherous backdrop.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital mineral from the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a tapestry of warp jumps and calculated risks, each hyperspace transit a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and hostile alien encounters. The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys, demanding a different kind of courage – a courage forged not in the clash of steel, but in the face of cosmic indifference.
