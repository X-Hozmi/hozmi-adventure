
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa, whispered to hold the secret of a lost healing herb, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, with each step, the allure of the unknown spurred her forward, a burning ember in the twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from her home in the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of peril, the isolation a constant companion, but the promise of discovery fueled her courage and kept her engine roaring towards the unknown.
