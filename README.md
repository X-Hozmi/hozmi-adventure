
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a dangerous mission to deliver a vital message to Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the plague stalked her every step.  Each sunrise brought the promise of breathtaking vistas, but also the chilling reality of survival in a land rife with peril and uncertainty.  The journey, though arduous, fueled her spirit with a fierce independence, a taste of adventure that few women of her time could ever experience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling gas and distant suns, held both wonder and immense danger.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of unknown alien encounters tested her skill and courage.   Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on the unknown possibilities awaiting her crew on a planet that could hold the key to humanity's future, or its annihilation.
