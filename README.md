
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her safe delivery to the distant Sultan's court.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague, yet the fire in her heart burns brighter than any hardship.  The promise of reaching her destination fuels her onward, a testament to the indomitable spirit of a medieval traveler.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Faster-than-light travel brings its own dangers – rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp core failure. But Rexa, hardened by years of exploration, faces the cosmos with unwavering courage. The vastness of space holds both terrifying unknowns and unimaginable rewards, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble worth taking.
