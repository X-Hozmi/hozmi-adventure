
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape,  his small band of companions equally haggard. Their quest, a perilous journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains to retrieve a sacred relic, tested their mettle with every rocky ascent, every icy river crossing, and every encounter with bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the glimmer of the distant peaks spurred them on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, monitored the jump drive as they prepared to breach the intergalactic rift. Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars and the hum of their ship, held a different kind of terror than mountains and bandits, but the promise of discovery fueled their courage as they ventured into the unknown.
