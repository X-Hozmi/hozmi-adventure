
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of Eldoria’s legendary treasures. Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the landscape, promised new challenges and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.  He carried with him not only a worn map and a rusty sword, but the unwavering hope of a fortune beyond his wildest dreams.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion to Captain Eva Rostova.  Navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos, a gateway to uncharted galaxies, was far removed from Thomas's muddy track, yet the sense of adventure burned just as brightly.  The vastness of space, speckled with shimmering stars and the potential danger lurking within unmapped systems, fueled her relentless pursuit of the legendary Kryll artifact.  Each jump to hyperspace brought the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of encountering something utterly alien, a risk she willingly embraced for the sake of her mission and the thrill of the unknown.
