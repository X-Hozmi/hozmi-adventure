
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed wilds of the Black Forest, a rumored shortcut to the distant city of Prague, but also a haven for bandits and mythical beasts. Her small band of travelers, a grizzled knight, a wizened scholar, and a suspiciously cheerful thief, relied on their wits and steel as much as their weary mounts to navigate the treacherous terrain, each day bringing the promise of danger and the thrill of discovery. The whispers of ancient ruins and hidden treasures fueled their journey, a potent elixir against the ever-present threat of starvation and violence.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Ryker' Ryland piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of his ship's navigation system. His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  The vastness of space, peppered with celestial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets, made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, but the hope of sustaining life on a distant world, and the thrill of exploring uncharted galaxies, outweighed the risks.
