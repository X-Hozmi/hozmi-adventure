
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the devastating plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the unwavering determination in her eyes burned brighter than the dying light.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and fiery gas.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare element from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, vital to powering Earth's new generation of faster-than-light engines.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of gravitational anomalies were all in a day's work for Eva, a seasoned explorer pushing the boundaries of human exploration across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
