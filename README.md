Ahead lay the whispering forests of Arden, rumored to house both mythical beasts and forgotten pathways to the distant kingdom of Eldoria.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the plague that stalked the land.  Each day brought a new challenge, a test of her endurance and courage, forging her into a woman as strong and resilient as the land itself.

Their jump to the Xylos system had been rough, throwing them off course. Now, navigating the treacherous asteroid field surrounding the planet Xylos Prime, their mission to retrieve the rare Xylos crystals was complicated by the threat of pirate scavengers who patrolled these very dangerous space lanes. With his crew battling malfunctions and the ever present threat of space pirates,  Rexx knew that every jump and maneuver was a gamble for the future of his crew and a crucial delivery to the galactic senate.
