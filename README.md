
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit patrols, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim reminder of how far he still had to go.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna, and light years from her home galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the alien dangers of uncharted planets were the realities of her interstellar voyage. The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also the chilling certainty of loneliness and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
