
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering behemoth of pack mules and weary men, creeps across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient ruins, treacherous mountain passes guarded by swirling mists, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, whispers of exotic spices and untold riches in the distant East, propel us onward, each creak of the wagon wheels a testament to our unwavering resolve. The journey is arduous, but the thrill of the unknown, the chance to witness lands untouched by our own, makes every hardship worthwhile.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive fills the void between galaxies.  We are explorers, charting a course through unmapped nebulae, searching for habitable worlds beyond the known sectors. Each jump into hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the swirling vortex of spacetime.  The risks are immense – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the potential rewards – the discovery of new life, new resources, and new worlds to call home – are an irresistible call to the intrepid souls who dare to venture beyond the confines of known space.
