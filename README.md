
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each howling wolf, each suspicious gaze from a passing knight added to the mounting tension of her perilous journey, a desperate race against time and the relentless dangers of medieval travel.  She yearned for the safety of home, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a newly-discovered habitable planet teeming with potential.   Warp jumps took them across light years, dodging asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, testing the mettle of her crew as they pushed the boundaries of human exploration, risking everything for a chance to build a new future amongst the stars.
