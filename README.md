
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a map, a few dried apples, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Saragossa before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – yet the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Saragossa's hidden wonders, propelled her forward, a tiny speck against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky black between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust. Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster rumored to hold planets ripe for colonization.  The risks were immense – unknown alien life, treacherous gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of subspace anomalies – but the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, fueled her crew's relentless drive towards the uncharted frontiers.
