
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a whisper on the wind, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the harsh desert tested the limits of endurance.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous sandstorms, bartering for scarce water, and facing the constant threat of starvation.  But the lure of Zerzura, with its promised riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the immensity of the landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route connecting the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The journey was a tapestry of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns – navigating asteroid fields, evading rogue black holes, and facing the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos, but the promise of discovery and the expansion of human knowledge fueled her unwavering determination.
