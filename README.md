
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar perfume of the road. His quest – to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for his sister's illness – felt as vast and unforgiving as the landscape itself. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were companions on this arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe, each sunrise bringing new challenges and uncertain dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from her home.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby against the backdrop of breathtaking cosmic vistas.  This journey, unlike Thomas’s, was measured not in days but in weeks of warped spacetime, a gamble against unforeseen stellar anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions across the galactic frontier.  The rewards, however – the potential discovery of new life, new resources – fueled her daring expedition.
