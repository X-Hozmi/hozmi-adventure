
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The journey to the rumored lost city of El Dorado was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, treacherous mountain passes tested her courage, and the whispers of mythical creatures kept her perpetually on edge.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the lure of untold riches and forgotten knowledge fueled her onward, her spirit as unyielding as the rocky terrain beneath her feet.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  His mission: to locate a fabled nebula rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the volatile space lanes controlled by the Kryll Hegemony.  The vast emptiness of space held both immense beauty and unimaginable dangers, a testament to the boundless adventure that still beckoned humankind, even amongst the stars.
