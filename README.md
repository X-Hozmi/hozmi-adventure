
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, urged his weary mount onward. The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track winding through the unforgiving French countryside. His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his perilous journey across the land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems demanded nerves of steel and unparalleled piloting skill.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a different kind of perilous journey, yet the allure of the unknown propelled her forward across the galaxies.
