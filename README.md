
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Ys, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their mettle. Yet, the lure of Ys, a city whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred them on. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the desperate men who preyed upon travelers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant suns and alien landscapes, held both wonder and terror.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of deep space were all part of a day's work. The discovery of new worlds, potentially teeming with life, or the terrifying unknown hidden in the cosmic dark, fueled her relentless journey across the stars.
