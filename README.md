
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both horse and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the glint of gold in his imagination, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onwards, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route connecting the Andromeda galaxy to the distant Cygnus X-1 system.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, encountering alien civilizations, and mapping uncharted territories far outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars, held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, driving her ever forward.
