
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with winter rain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, pushing him to brave the unknown dangers of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core breach.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the predatory K'tharr warships, and battling the crippling effects of interdimensional space-time distortions were daily realities.  The vastness of the cosmos, both breathtaking and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers, but the promise of rediscovering humanity’s lost kin fueled her unwavering resolve.
