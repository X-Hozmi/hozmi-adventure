
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map, promising the location of a lost monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the Inquisition's agents, hot on her trail.  Survival depended not only on her wits and endurance but also on the kindness of strangers and the capriciousness of fate along the medieval roads.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the gargantuan engines of the *Stardust Drifter* humming a steady, reassuring song.  His mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy, a task made perilous by unstable wormholes and the ever-present threat of Kryll raiders.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking vistas of cosmic wonders, but the loneliness of interstellar space, and the constant threat of malfunction or attack, gnawed at the edges of Rexx's courage. The fate of a civilization lay in the balance, and the adventure stretched across the infinite distances of space.
