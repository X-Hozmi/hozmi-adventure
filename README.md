
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of defying the limitations of his time, fueled his weary steps towards the horizon's hazy promise.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding population, a desperate gamble amidst dwindling resources on Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, yet the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vastness of interstellar space.  The weight of humanity’s future rested on her shoulders as she navigated the cosmic ocean.
