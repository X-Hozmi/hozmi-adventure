
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed commitment to reach his destination, no matter the cost.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly across the void.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes were mere inconveniences compared to the looming threat of the Kryll, a sentient space-faring species known for their insatiable hunger for resources.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, but the promise of finding her missing kin spurred her onwards, a beacon of hope in the infinite darkness.
