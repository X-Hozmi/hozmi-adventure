Ahead, a crumbling tower marked the border of the Wildlands, a region known for its bandit gangs and treacherous terrain. The air was thick with the scent of pine and smoke, a strange mix of nature and danger. For a young knight, this was the true adventure, not the polished halls of the king's court.
