He clutched the tattered map, its faded ink promising riches and glory in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the tension.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape were constant companions on his arduous journey across the known world, a quest fraught with peril but fueled by the intoxicating dream of untold treasure.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The journey, a blur of hyperspace jumps and meticulous navigation, was a symphony of crackling energy and the low hum of the ship’s powerful engines.  While far removed from the immediate dangers of bandits, the vastness of space presented its own unique challenges – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the risk.
