
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for the legendary healing herbs rumored to grow only in the remote monastery nestled beyond the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, was a potential threat in this untamed land, yet the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a sharp counterpoint to the gnawing fear.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a perilous one, fraught with asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Jax, hardened by years of traversing the cosmos, felt the familiar tingle of excitement. The universe was vast, unforgiving, and utterly breathtaking, and he, a humble captain, was about to carve his own path through its wonders.
