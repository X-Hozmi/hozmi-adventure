
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his brother's wasting sickness.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits shadowed his journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the capricious whims of fate.  He carried with him not only hope, but also the weight of his family's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions tested her skills and courage to the limit. The vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos, a canvas of swirling colours and unimaginable distances, held both promise and peril, a testament to the human spirit's relentless drive for exploration and discovery.
