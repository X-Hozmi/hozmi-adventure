
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and herbs; it held the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of a blacksmith's forge in a distant valley, far from the plague-ridden village she'd fled.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill and terror of the unknown, the constant companions of a medieval journey across unforgiving lands.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rourke steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  Unlike Elara, Rexx faced a different kind of hardship – the isolation of interstellar travel, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the constant pressure to deliver on a promise that could change the galaxy forever.
