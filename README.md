
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys before winter's grip tightened, felt more desperate with each creaking mile.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of famine gnawed at the edges of his resolve. Yet, the whispered promise of Ys – a city of gold and untold magic – fueled his relentless journey across the land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship piercing the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva's crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both unimaginable wonders and deadly perils, a far cry from the medieval adventurer's struggles, yet echoing the same spirit of courageous exploration.
