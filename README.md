
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, lay across a continent teeming with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just a few of the trials he faced.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the elements and the hostile inhabitants of this unforgiving land, but the whispered tales of Eldoria’s glittering spires fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes.  The thrill of exploration pulsed through her crew as they charted new systems, encountered strange alien life, and faced the ever-present danger of warp storms.  The vastness of space offered unparalleled freedom, but it also held hidden threats that could extinguish their hopes in an instant.
