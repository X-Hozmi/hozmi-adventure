
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Aella.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, reminding her of the bandits and wild beasts that shared this desolate land. Survival, not glory, fueled her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport painted a canvas of breathtaking chaos, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engine. Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was a different kind of danger than bandits or beasts; the unknown, the unpredictable cosmic forces, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life, posed a constant challenge.  Yet, the lure of discovery pushed her onward.
