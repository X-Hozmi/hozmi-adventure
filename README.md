
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the tattered map, its faded ink depicting the rumored location of Eldoria, a city said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent shivers down his spine – not just from the cold, but from the very real dangers lurking in the shadow of the Black Forest: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His journey was a gamble, a desperate quest for fortune that demanded courage, resilience, and a healthy dose of blind faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with swirling nebulae and distant suns, both awed and terrified her.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unknown alien lifeforms were commonplace hazards, while the ever-present threat of engine failure or pirate attacks loomed larger than any earthly danger.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to rewrite the history of interstellar travel, propelled her forward into the uncharted cosmic frontier.
