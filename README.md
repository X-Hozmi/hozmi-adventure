
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and dark forests concealing both bounty and peril.  Her quest, to reach the legendary monastery of St. Gildas and deliver a vital message, was fraught with uncertainty.  Bandits roamed the roads, the weather was unpredictable, and whispers of a plague spreading through the villages added a chilling undercurrent to her journey. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, a new landscape to navigate, and the constant gnawing fear that her mission might end before she reached her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart a mirror of the cosmic chaos around her.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, had been rough, but the shimmering turquoise planet beckoned, a promise of new life amidst the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space.  Navigation through uncharted asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirates and rogue AI made this interstellar voyage a constant test of skill and nerve.  The galaxy was a breathtaking expanse of wonder, but also a deadly wilderness where the smallest error could mean oblivion.
