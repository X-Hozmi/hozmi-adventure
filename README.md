
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a menacing backdrop to her journey.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a destination reached by few.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils she faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of despair that gnawed at her resolve.  The thrill of discovery, however, fueled her onward, a fiery ember against the cold winds of uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the Alcubierre drive a constant companion.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and deciphering ancient star charts were child's play compared to the temporal distortions warping space-time itself.  Yet, the possibility of finding survivors, of rewriting history, propelled her forward across the vast expanse of the cosmos, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of time and space.
