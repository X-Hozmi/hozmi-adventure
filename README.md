
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a closer step toward the legend he hoped to uncover, a gamble with fate played out against the breathtaking backdrop of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic K'tharr civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps between star systems were commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace currents meant every voyage was a high-stakes gamble.  The crew faced threats both cosmic – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies – and interpersonal – the growing tension between the human and K'tharr representatives aboard.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and the promise of galactic-spanning discovery.
