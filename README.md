
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her quest – to find the legendary Sunstone hidden in the forgotten monastery of St. Seraphina – had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the hushed, whispering valleys where ancient spirits were said to dwell. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant dance between hope and the stark reality of a hostile, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Navigating hyperspace was a perilous gamble, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the risk of encountering rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, or worse – the enigmatic entities known only as the Voidwalkers.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle of celestial wonders, held both unimaginable beauty and unimaginable danger.
