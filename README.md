
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each whispered prayer to the Virgin Mary, marked a step closer to either salvation or certain death at the hands of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving wilderness itself.  The map, brittle with age, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to the immense challenge before her.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a perilous journey through uncharted sectors teeming with unpredictable celestial phenomena and potential pirate incursions.  Warp drive hummed, a constant reminder of the incredible power, and inherent risks, of traversing the galaxy. The fate of thousands rested on her skill and courage as she navigated the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
