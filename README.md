
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary steed as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Yet, the whispered rumors of a lost city, brimming with ancient knowledge and untold riches, fueled her relentless trek.  Each aching muscle, each scraped knee, was a testament to her unwavering resolve.

Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace were mere challenges compared to the political tensions brewing between the Terran Federation and the Xylossian Confederacy, both vying for control of the planet's resources.  Ryla, however, was driven by a thirst for discovery, a desire to chart new territories and uncover the secrets hidden amongst the stars.
