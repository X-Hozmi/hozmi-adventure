
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath of her aging mount, mirrored the anxieties in her own heart.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint-Sulpice, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles compared to the relentless hope fueling her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Conversely,  Jaxx’s journey spanned lightyears, not leagues.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  a sleek vessel built for interstellar travel, hummed beneath him as he navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The breathtaking cosmic vistas – vibrant nebulas and distant galaxies – offered breathtaking beauty, but the ever-present danger of space pirates and unpredictable wormhole collapses kept him on high alert.  His mission: to retrieve a rare artifact from the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with peril but vital to the survival of his people.
