
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, the unforgiving terrain tested both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. But the whispered rumors of a hidden monastery, said to hold the key to her family's lost legacy, spurred her onward, each aching muscle fueled by a desperate hope.  The vast, untamed landscape stretched before her, a tapestry of danger and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent light as his freighter, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void. His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of the ancient Proxima civilization.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy was measured not in days or weeks, but in the calculated risk of warp-core failures and the ever-present danger of space pirates. But the potential riches, both scientific and material, promised a reward beyond compare, outweighing the perils of traversing the unforgiving black.
