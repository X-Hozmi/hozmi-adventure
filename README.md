
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He’d left the familiar comfort of his village weeks ago, a map clutched tight in his sweat-stained hand,  seeking the legendary Sunstone city whispered to lie beyond the Dragon’s Tooth mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the thrill of the unknown – the promise of fortune, or perhaps, a gruesome end at the hands of bandits or wild beasts.  The journey was perilous, the path treacherous, but the allure of the unknown fueled his every step.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable space storms,  Eva relied on her wits, her crew's unwavering loyalty, and the cutting-edge technology of her vessel.  The vastness of space held both immense beauty and terrifying danger, but the hope of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f, made the impossible journey worthwhile.
