
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate pilgrimage to Avignon seeking a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry or worse – the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown fueled her journey, transforming the mundane miles into a perilous, thrilling adventure. The vastness of the land, the unpredictable elements, and the ever-present danger sharpened every sense, forging her spirit in the crucible of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumoured haven for rare xeno-flora.  The jump to hyperspace had been smooth, but the potential for encountering rogue asteroids or, worse, pirate raiders, was a constant companion. This was not a mere voyage; it was a gamble against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, a thrilling hunt for fortune and knowledge amongst the breathtaking wonders and terrible dangers of the galaxy.  The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the risk.
