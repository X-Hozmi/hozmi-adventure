Dust devils dance in the distance, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We've faced bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease, but the promise of the fabled Silk Road markets in Samarkand fuels our weary steps. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset the bittersweet satisfaction of another day survived on this perilous journey across the known world.

Conversely, the starship *Stardust* cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faintest whispers of nebulae, her crew a diverse band of xeno-linguists, engineers, and explorers.  Their mission: to establish contact with the elusive Kryll civilization.  The vast distances between galaxies, the potential for encountering hostile lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure make each jump a gamble. But the chance to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, to expand human knowledge beyond the pale blue dot of their origin, makes it all worthwhile.
