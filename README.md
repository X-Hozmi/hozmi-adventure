
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, a perilous journey to deliver a sacred relic to the Pope, had taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over rivers swollen with spring rains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous terrain, bartering for supplies in suspicious villages, and evading the constant threat of warlords and outlaws.  The weight of his responsibility and the ever-present danger fueled his resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic beauty a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take years and traverse uncharted regions filled with gravitational anomalies and potential encounters with unknown alien life.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast unknown,  but the hope of finding the colonists, and uncovering the secrets of their disappearance, pushed her onwards.
