
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of the unknown, the promise of adventure beyond the confines of his village, spurred him onward, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey through unmapped star systems teeming with the unknown.  Advanced technology provided some security, but unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms kept her crew on high alert. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of adventure, but the thrill of exploration remained timeless.
