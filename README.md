
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward. The journey across the rugged highlands of Scotland had been brutal, a constant test of endurance against biting winds, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge, a daunting expanse of heather and rock, or a ford swollen by recent rains.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Ys, whispered to lie hidden in the mists of the western isles, fueled his relentless pursuit, a beacon in the unforgiving landscape.  He pressed on, driven by a mixture of ambition and a desperate hope for the glory promised in the ancient prophecies.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a tapestry of breathtaking cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unseen gravitational anomalies.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and scientists, faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers;  navigating wormholes, repairing hull breaches caused by rogue space debris, and even dealing with the occasional alien encounter.  Their destination, the planet Kepler-186f, promised untold scientific discoveries, but the journey itself was a testament to human ingenuity and the unquenchable thirst for exploration.
