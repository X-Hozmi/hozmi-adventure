
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the unwavering hope in her heart spurred her on, fueled by the promise of a miracle beyond the treacherous mountain passes.  The journey was brutal, a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting kindnesses from strangers, but her resolve remained as steadfast as the ancient stones that marked her path.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx "Renegade" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of the cockpit.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of bridging the vast expanse between galaxies.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, each one a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate attacks.  But the allure of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting new worlds beyond the known cosmos, outweighed the risks. The galaxy was vast, a frontier ripe for exploration, and Jaxx, with his crew of seasoned spacefarers, was determined to stake his claim amongst the stars.
