
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant shimmer.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it holds the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to find a rumored haven from the creeping plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the sun on her face and the vastness of the land before her fuels a fierce, stubborn determination – a quest for survival woven into the very fabric of this medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver gleam against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: a decades-long expedition to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out habitable planets.  The jump to hyperspace is a blinding flash, followed by the comforting hum of the engines.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, the unpredictable nature of alien life – the thrill of discovery, the push against the unknown, mirrors Elara's medieval journey.  Both women are pioneers, driven by a spirit of adventure that transcends time and space.
