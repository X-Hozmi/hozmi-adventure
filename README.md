
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both horse and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the whispers of silks, spices, and untold riches spurred her on, a defiant glint in her eye despite the hardships. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new step closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours a stark contrast to the sterile metallic gleam of his ship.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the crippling effects of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for Razor, though the loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at him, a price paid for exploring the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
