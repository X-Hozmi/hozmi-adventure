The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Gold, a fabled metropolis whispered about in taverns and sung of in ballads, its location a secret guarded by treacherous terrain and wilder beasts.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the anticipation of his perilous journey, a test of courage and endurance against the untamed wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump through the void was a gamble, a leap of faith across the vast emptiness, a testament to humanity’s relentless drive to explore the cosmos and claim new worlds.
