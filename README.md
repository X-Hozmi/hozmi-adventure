
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a vengeful lord. Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, with every sunrise, the vast, unknown landscape fueled her adventurous spirit, promising a future far beyond the confines of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson and gold dust swirling around his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  He faced dangers far removed from the medieval world – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and alien lifeforms both beautiful and terrifying. Yet the lure of the cosmos, the thrill of discovering new worlds and pushing the boundaries of human exploration, overshadowed any fear.  The universe was his canvas, and his ship, his brush.
