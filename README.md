
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each crunch of mud beneath the beast's hooves, punctuated the silence of the unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him a king's ransom in spices, a desperate gamble to escape the plague-ridden city and find a new life in the East.  Bandits, starvation, and disease lurked around every bend, testing his resolve at every step of his perilous journey across the untamed continent.

Her mission: to locate the mythical lost colony of Lyra, scattered across the galaxies after a devastating solar flare centuries ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders, Elara relied on her wits and the advanced technology of her vessel to overcome impossible odds and unearth the secrets of a long-lost civilization.
