
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack animals and weary men, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts. We are bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in canyons, raging sandstorms that threaten to engulf us, and the gnawing thirst that tests our resilience.  The reward, however, is the legend itself, the promise of untold riches and a place where the desert gives way to life beyond imagining.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship powered by a harnessed singularity, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies. Our mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a thrilling encounter with the unpredictable forces of the cosmos. The risks are immense – rogue asteroids, uncharted nebulae, and the ever-present threat of encountering alien life forms, both benevolent and hostile, all stand between us and the future of humanity.
