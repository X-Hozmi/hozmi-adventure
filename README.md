
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate quest for a legendary healer rumored to reside in the far-off kingdom of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, yet the allure of Eldoria, and the promise of salvation, spurred her onward despite the looming dangers of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson gas a breathtaking backdrop to the obsidian hull of the *Starseeker*.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across the Andromeda galaxy centuries ago.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own set of perils – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of spatial distortion. Yet the possibility of discovering a new world, of forging contact with a lost civilization, fueled Jaxx's relentless pursuit, a quest far grander than any medieval pilgrimage.
