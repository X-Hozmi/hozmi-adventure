
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to the air.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, lumbered across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown – the promise of bustling market towns or the danger of bandit raids, the beauty of untouched forests or the harshness of unforgiving deserts. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril but rich in the camaraderie of shared hardship and the breathtaking spectacle of a world largely uncharted.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a sleek vessel slicing through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to survey the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  The vast distances, measured in light years, were a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the breathtaking scale of the cosmos.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards – the discovery of new life, new worlds, new possibilities – far outweighed the risks.
