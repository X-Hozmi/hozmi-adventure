
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease.  Yet, with every hardship, her resolve hardened, fueled by the image of her brother's pale face.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a silver needle piercing the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating through treacherous nebulae and evading pirate ships, Eva felt a kinship with the medieval travelers of old. The vast emptiness of space mirrored the vast, unknown stretches of medieval lands, both journeys testing courage, resilience, and an unwavering belief in a destination shrouded in legend.
