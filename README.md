
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the adventure, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – that lay between her and her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's vibrant hues.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards; the vastness of space, however, presented a different kind of fear – the isolating loneliness of an infinite universe, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic anomalies lurking in the void.
