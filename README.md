
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the scent of brine and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay the treacherous Silk Road, a tapestry woven with sun-baked deserts, towering mountain passes guarded by brigands, and bustling caravanserais offering fleeting respite.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new landscapes, new dangers –  a sudden sandstorm, the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger – but also the allure of exotic lands and the whispered legends of fabled cities lost to time.  We travelled by mule, on foot, sometimes by river barge, our hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration with every step closer to our unknown destination.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Starseeker' hummed beneath our feet as we hurtled through the inky blackness, leaving behind the familiar glow of Kepler-186f. Our destination: Gliese 581g, a planet whispered to possess oceans and a breathable atmosphere. The journey, measured not in days but in years, offered breathtaking views of nebulae painted across the cosmos and the chilling beauty of a dying star.  Advanced technology shielded us from the harsh realities of space, yet the vastness and mystery of the universe instilled a sense of awe and a humbling perspective rarely matched by any terrestrial exploration.
