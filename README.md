
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried rations; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to reach the distant city of Eldoria and secure an alliance against the encroaching Saracen armies.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the challenges awaiting her on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a gamble against the setting sun.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet teeming with a rumored energy source vital to the survival of the Galactic Federation.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the Xylos system was notorious for its unpredictable wormholes and hostile pirate factions lurking in the shadows of the cosmos.  The journey was a race against time, a desperate gamble against the odds,  with the fate of billions resting on her shoulders and the vast, indifferent expanse of space her only companion.
