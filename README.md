
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow stinging her nostrils.  Her worn leather satchel held her only possessions: a chipped map promising untold riches in the distant kingdom of Eldoria, a few dried figs, and a worn dagger – her only defense against the bandits and wild beasts that haunted these lonely trails. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay ahead in her grand adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the Althea shuddering as it jumped across the void between galaxies.  His mission: to locate the fabled Kryll Nebula, rumored to contain a substance capable of creating faster-than-light travel.  The star charts were unreliable, the navigational sensors glitching under the strain of intergalactic travel, but the lure of such a monumental discovery propelled him onward.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of nebulae, was both terrifying and awe-inspiring, a stark contrast to the familiar confines of his ship, a testament to the boundless scope of his journey.
