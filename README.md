
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne stretching before them.  Their quest: to retrieve the stolen reliquary of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of the bandit lord, Renaud.  Days blurred into weeks, each sunrise revealing treacherous mountain passes, shadowed forests teeming with unseen dangers, and rivers swollen with the relentless spring thaw.  Their horses, once proud steeds, were now gaunt shadows, mirroring the dwindling hope in the hearts of the weary knights.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star-cruiser a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space. Her mission: to establish contact with the long-lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Warp drives hummed, a constant thrum against the silence of the void, punctuated only by the crackle of comms and the rhythmic pulse of life support.  The journey was a test of endurance, not just for the crew, but for the ship itself, battling solar flares and navigating asteroid fields, a perilous dance between the sublime beauty of the cosmos and the harsh reality of interstellar travel.
