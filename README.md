
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a testament to countless rips and repairs, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a destination whispered about in hushed tones – a place of untold riches and equally untold dangers.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of the cockpit.  His mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining crystals to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of collapse.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates, a race known for their brutal efficiency and advanced weaponry, was a daily challenge.  The vast expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying peril, but the promise of salvation for Kepler-186f fueled his relentless journey.
