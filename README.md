
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses’ hooves sinking into the parched earth.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, and each sunset the chilling reality of dwindling supplies. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their kingdom.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, from the shadowed forests teeming with wild boar, to the soaring peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, where the air itself seemed to bite.  Their courage, however, burned brighter than the midday sun.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Terra, scattered across the far reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  Alien landscapes unfolded before her – vibrant purple plains on Kepler-186f, towering crystalline structures on a planet orbiting a binary star – each a testament to the universe's boundless wonder. Yet, the loneliness of interstellar travel, the constant hum of the ship's engines, was a heavy burden against the backdrop of cosmic majesty.
