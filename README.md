
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager provisions in dusty villages.  Their quest, to secure an alliance against a rising northern threat, demanded courage, resilience, and an unwavering faith in the providence of God.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable alien lifeforms and treacherous landscapes.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of distant suns were everyday occurrences, but the real danger lay in the volatile politics of the intergalactic alliance, a constant threat of betrayal and sabotage lurking just beyond the shimmering expanse of hyperspace.  The fate of her crew, and perhaps her entire sector, rested on the success of this perilous journey.
