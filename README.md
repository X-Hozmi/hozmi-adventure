
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as her horse, a sturdy mare named Bess, picks its way across the parched landscape.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promises both peril and the rumored lost city of Zerzura, its fabled treasures a siren call against the gnawing hunger in Elara's belly.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown, the promise of glory, fuels her onward.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The hyperdrive hums a hypnotic tune as they jump between star systems, chasing whispers of a lost Precursor civilization.  Alien landscapes, swirling nebulae painted across the void, and the ever-present danger of pirate raiders make each leg of her journey a high-stakes gamble.  The lure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of a bygone age, outweighs the risks; Eva and her crew press on, driven by a thirst for knowledge that spans the vast emptiness of space.
