
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tightly.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees mountains did little to deter her; she was bound for the rumored City of Gold, a legend whispered amongst her people.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the unpredictable beauty and peril inherent in medieval travel.  Companionship offered by a grizzled knight and a mischievous young boy balanced the ever-present risk of starvation, disease, and unforeseen encounters.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours of alien planets pulsed on her navigation screen, each a potential destination, each a potential danger.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would test the limits of both her ship and her crew.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle, held equal measures of wonder and terrifying unknown, from rogue asteroids to uncharted wormholes – each jump a gamble, each arrival a victory in this grand interstellar odyssey.
