
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and impending storm clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats and a well-thumbed map, its creases mirroring the lines etched on her face.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse; a constant reminder of the perils facing a lone woman journeying across the war-torn kingdom. Her quest, to find a lost herbalist's manuscript rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging her village, demanded courage and resilience far beyond the ordinary.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding rogue asteroid fields was a daily challenge, the hum of the ship's engines a constant counterpoint to the breathtaking views of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies. Her mission, a search for a habitable planet capable of sustaining humanity’s expanding population, demanded precision, unwavering resolve, and a thirst for discovery that echoed the spirit of her medieval predecessors – though her methods, and the stakes, were immeasurably greater.
