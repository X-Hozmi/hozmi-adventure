
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the unforgiving landscape tested her resilience daily. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and secrets, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, a swirling tapestry of nebulae and unmapped planets.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – the thrill of discovery remained the same.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her, a testament to human ambition and the unending quest for the unknown.
