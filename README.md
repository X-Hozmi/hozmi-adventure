
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she trudges across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies, feels like lead.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death follow her every step as she journeys to rejoin her estranged brother, a knight fighting in the Hundred Years' War. Each sunrise brings a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, murky forests teeming with unseen dangers, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the unwavering hope of reunion fuels her perilous pilgrimage across the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Vast distances between planets are measured in lightyears, not miles.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion as she traverses the galaxy, charting unmapped systems and searching for the legendary lost colony of Aethel.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faces the ever-present threat of pirate attacks and malfunctioning warp engines.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, and the legacy of their ancestors propel them onwards through the star-strewn expanse of the cosmos.
