
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's worn leather boots pounded the rutted track.  His retinue, a motley collection of knights and squires, trailed behind, their faces grim under the relentless sun.  Their journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a desperate hope for survival.  Yet, the lure of the Sultan's legendary hoard, and the glory that would follow its acquisition, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with its own perils.  Warp jumps were unpredictable, alien lifeforms potentially hostile, and the vastness of space itself a constant reminder of the ship's fragile position.  But Eva, fueled by the unquenchable thirst for discovery and the promise of finding a new habitable world for humanity, pressed on.  The cosmos held infinite dangers, but also infinite rewards.
