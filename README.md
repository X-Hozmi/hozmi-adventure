
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new vista to marvel at – a testament to the raw, untamed beauty and constant danger of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance steered her starship *Stardust* through the nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a breathtaking backdrop to the hum of the hyperdrive.  Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and untold risks.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, alien encounters held the promise of both wonder and annihilation, and the loneliness of interstellar space gnawed at her spirit.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for expanding the boundaries of human knowledge, spurred her onward, a modern-day echo of Elara’s medieval pilgrimage.
