
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, had led him through bandit-infested forests, across scorching deserts, and over treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – the relentless sun, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of wild animals and rival knights. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with peril: unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space.  But the promise of new worlds, teeming with undiscovered life and resources beyond imagination, fuelled her unwavering determination.  The cosmos held infinite possibilities, and Elara was determined to chart a course through them all.
