
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the creeping plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown brush, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the even deadlier hand of starvation.  This journey, fraught with peril, was a pilgrimage of hope across a vast and unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space was as isolating as any medieval wilderness, the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies a stark contrast to the constant threat of asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present danger of equipment failure light years from any known rescue.  His journey was a quest for survival, a voyage across an unimaginable expanse of cosmic dust and starlight.
