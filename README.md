
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a testament to weeks of relentless travel, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, reminding her of the perilous beauty of this medieval journey – a quest for a mythical healing herb, a gamble for her life and the lives of her people.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, pierced the inky blackness of hyperspace.  Navigating through nebulae of breathtaking colour and encountering alien life forms both wondrous and terrifying were commonplace on her interstellar voyages. The thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, the exhilaration of discovering new worlds, far outweighed the risks of asteroid fields and hostile alien empires.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a journey that spanned light-years and tested the limits of human ingenuity and courage in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
