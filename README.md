Her journey across the sprawling plains of Francia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and whispers of the Black Death stalked her every step. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unpredictable landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  A single miscalculation could strand them in the void, or worse, expose them to the unknown horrors lurking between galaxies.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also terrifying isolation.
