
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes guarded by snow leopards, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by desperate prayer and the whispers of ancient maps, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life beyond humanity's reach.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory warships of the Kryll Empire, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's cutting-edge technology. The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than a medieval forest, but the lure of discovery, the possibility of contacting another civilization, was a powerful incentive, a future worth risking everything for.
