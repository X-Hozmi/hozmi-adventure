
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail glinting under the unforgiving sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Ardennes forest, was treacherous.  Bandits, rumored to lurk in the shadows, were a constant threat, and the gnawing hunger in his belly was a more immediate one. His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to possess a relic capable of curing his ailing daughter.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrill and terror of his perilous journey across the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  The swirling nebula outside the viewport was a breathtaking spectacle, but her focus remained fixed on the coordinates – Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey had already spanned months, a constant dance between navigating asteroid fields, repairing minor hull breaches from micrometeoroid impacts, and battling the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar space.  The potential discovery, however, far outweighed the risks of this galactic odyssey.
