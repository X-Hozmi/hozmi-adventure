
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth thick in the air.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones, led her through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers spanned only by rickety rope bridges, and past bandit-ridden forests where the shadows held more danger than the daylight.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the lure of the unknown, of uncovering the secrets Zerzura held, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Starfall' navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, flung across the vast gulf between galaxies.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with peril – gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable whims of the spacetime continuum.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of bearing witness to a civilization lost to time, fueled his journey across the uncharted territories of the universe, a voyage as daunting and potentially rewarding as any medieval pilgrimage.
