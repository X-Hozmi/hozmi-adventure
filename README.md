
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of reaching Zerzura, of defying the odds and saving her brother, fueled her onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate raid was all in a day's work for a seasoned intergalactic courier. Yet, the breathtaking vistas of alien planets and the awe-inspiring expanse of the cosmos always held a certain thrill, a constant reminder of the wonder and peril inherent in pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
