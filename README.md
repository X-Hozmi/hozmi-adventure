
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, swift rivers demanding perilous crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the possibility of glory and untold riches, spurred her onwards, her heart thrumming with the intoxicating rhythm of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a rapidly expanding human civilization.  Warp jumps brought breathtaking views of celestial wonders, but also the constant risk of encountering unpredictable space anomalies and hostile alien lifeforms.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested Nova's courage and skill, as she navigated the infinite frontier.
