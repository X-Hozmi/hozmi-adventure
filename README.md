
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s small band of knights crested the hill, the harsh sun beating down on their worn leather armor.  Before them stretched the endless, unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside, a tapestry woven with treacherous bogs, dense forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging their kingdom.  Each day was a gamble against the elements, disease, and the unpredictable savagery of man.  Survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding not with fear, but with the exhilaration of charting unmapped space.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists, engineers, and seasoned explorers, navigated the treacherous gravitational currents, their scanners constantly searching for habitable planets within the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vastness of space, the thrill of discovering alien civilizations, and the constant threat of cosmic anomalies made their interstellar voyage a breathtaking, perilous adventure unlike any other in human history.
