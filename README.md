
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, pushed him relentlessly forward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The challenges were different now – navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers in heavily-armed freighters, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive straining against the fabric of spacetime.  Yet the same thrill of discovery, the same yearning for the unknown, fueled her journey, a lone star charting a course through the infinite darkness.
