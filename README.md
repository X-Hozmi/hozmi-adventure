
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary steed onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Aquitaine, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards he'd left behind. His quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled metropolis said to hold the cure for the Black Death that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the silent, creeping plague itself.  Survival was a daily gamble, played out against a backdrop of breathtaking, unforgiving beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at faster-than-light speeds.  The ship groaned under the strain of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering uncharted wormholes.  The vast, inky blackness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, filled with the promise of discovery and the constant threat of the unknown – derelict alien vessels, hostile sentient life, and the ever-present danger of equipment failure light years from any rescue.
