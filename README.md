
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a tattered map, guiding her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable terrain itself were constant companions on this arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  This was no quest for a mythical cure; it was a scientific expedition, the search for habitable worlds a necessity for humanity's survival. Yet, the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies made this journey as perilous, in its own way, as Elara's medieval trek across the continent.
