
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the biting chill.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Yet, the unwavering glint in his eye spoke of a determination fueled by hope and a desperate need to return home.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking vistas of cosmic wonders unfolding outside her viewport.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels – but the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories in the vast ocean of space, spurred her onward.
