
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched earth.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.  The whispered legends of Zerzura fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unknown expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of interstellar space.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, she charted a course for the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  The vastness of the cosmos was a thrilling yet terrifying prospect, each new planet a potential haven or a graveyard of forgotten explorers.  Ryla’s mission – to seek out new civilizations and chart unmapped territories – was a quest for knowledge that dwarfed even the most daring medieval expeditions.
