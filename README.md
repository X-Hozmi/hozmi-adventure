
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back, urged his weary horse onward.  The map, a crudely drawn parchment, promised riches beyond the Whispering Mountains – a lost city said to hold treasures beyond imagining.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, fear, and the relentless beauty of a land both harsh and unforgiving.  They traveled for weeks, their small band of adventurers battling storms, crossing treacherous rivers, and relying on the kindness – and sometimes the suspicion – of the scattered villages they encountered along the way.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a humbling reminder of humanity's insignificance against the backdrop of a billion stars.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the danger of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. The galaxy stretched before them, a limitless ocean of adventure and peril, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery.
