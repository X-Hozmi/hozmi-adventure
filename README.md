
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather – a map leading to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a city said to hold secrets beyond imagining.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold riches, a constant tension fueling her onward journey through bandits' lairs, treacherous mountain passes, and whispering forests.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a civilization far exceeding humanity's own.  The hyperspace jump had been treacherous, leaving the ship shuddering with the aftereffects of folding spacetime.  But the allure of discovering new life, new technologies, and new worlds far outweighed the risks.  Ava gripped the controls, her eyes fixed on the swirling colours ahead, the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos her own personal frontier.
