
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the disease itself.  He pressed on, driven by a desperate hope that outweighed the ever-present dangers of the medieval road.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the distant Kepler-186f system.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate fleets, and facing the unpredictable whims of warp drives were all in a day's work. The vast distances and alien landscapes presented challenges far exceeding any medieval journey, yet the allure of discovery and the promise of new worlds burned as bright as the distant nebulae.
