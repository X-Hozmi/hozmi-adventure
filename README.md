
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a constant companion on his journey from the bustling port city of Bristol to the shadowed forests of the Black Forest.  He carried a king's writ, a sealed parchment promising riches and danger in equal measure, and the weight of his family's hopes rested heavily upon his shoulders.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the unknown adventures that lay ahead, a thrilling mix of anticipation and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the ever-present tension of deep space travel.  While the dangers were different—cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the uncharted territories of the galaxy—the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, resonated across the vast gulf of time, connecting Eva's journey to Thomas's, a shared human spirit of exploration.
