
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and the tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's fever.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog in the distant villages was a potential threat, each mountain pass a gamble against bandits and treacherous terrain.  Survival itself was the grandest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, each star a distant sun, each jump a calculated risk through the treacherous currents of spacetime.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Eva faced not bandits and storms, but cosmic radiation and the unpredictable whims of alien space.  The galaxy was her arena, and exploration its reward.
