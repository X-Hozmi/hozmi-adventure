
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the relentless sun threatened to bake her alive.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, heightened the sense of adventure and the ever-present threat of the unknown, a tapestry woven from hope and fear.  She pressed on, her heart pounding a rhythm against her ribs as determined as the hooves of her weary mount.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the ship shuddering through hyperspace.  The jump to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel, had been rough,  but the potential reward – unlocking faster-than-light travel across the galaxy – outweighed the risk.  His crew, a motley collection of seasoned explorers and wide-eyed cadets, were a tight-knit band, their camaraderie forged in the crucible of deep space. The hum of the engines, the distant starlight visible through the viewport, and the weight of their mission spurred them onward towards the unknown, their destiny a beacon amidst the cold expanse of the cosmos.
