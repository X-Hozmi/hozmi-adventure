
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary pack animals, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the relentless heat sapping our strength, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its whispered tales of unimaginable riches and exotic spices, pushes us onward.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every groan of a burdened camel, is a testament to the human spirit's insatiable thirst for adventure and discovery.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out the vast emptiness of interstellar space.  We're hurtling towards Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in subjective moments of time dilation.  The crew, a diverse band from across the known galaxies, share a bond forged in the face of unimaginable distances and potential peril.  Cosmic storms and rogue asteroids are ever-present threats, but the tantalizing prospect of galactic exploration and the chance to rewrite the laws of physics fuels our every action.
