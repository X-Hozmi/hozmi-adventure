
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small caravan struggled onward, the creak of wagon wheels a mournful counterpoint to the howling wind.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches, had already claimed two pack animals and tested their resilience to the bone.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed their every step, yet the lure of the unknown pushed them further into the unforgiving heart of the desert.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, a fragile flame against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists, engineers, and mercenaries, were on a mission to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out new, habitable worlds for a burgeoning human colony.  The vast distances between star systems, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life forms made every jump a gamble. Yet, the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity’s reach across the cosmos, fuelled their courage and pushed them towards the uncharted territories of the universe.
