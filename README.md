
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mount onward.  The journey to the fabled city of Zerzura had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets fueled her relentless trek across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise a promise of closer proximity to the legendary oasis and its rumored wonders.  The scent of woodsmoke in the distance offered hope, perhaps a village, perhaps respite… or further danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a terraformed planet teeming with alien flora and fauna, had been flawlessly executed, but the real adventure lay ahead.   Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the territorial patrols of the Kryll Hegemony were only the initial challenges.  Eva's mission, to locate a lost research team, demanded courage, quick thinking, and a healthy dose of luck within a galaxy brimming with both wonder and hostility. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, stretched before her.
