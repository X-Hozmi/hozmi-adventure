
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, the promise of salvation, spurred them onwards, each sunrise a renewed pledge to their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raids, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her spirit and resolve.  But the thought of her people, and the hope of finding a future for them all, fueled her engines and burned bright within her heart, a guiding light in the infinite darkness.
