
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track winding through the French countryside, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke and fear.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic. Bandits lurked in the shadows of the forests, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air heavier than the dust.  Each day was a gamble, a test of endurance and courage against the unforgiving wilderness and its hidden dangers.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded absolute precision and nerve of steel.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense distances separating humanity from its future amongst the stars.
