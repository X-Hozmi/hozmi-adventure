
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains of Aquitaine in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing king.  Robbers, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of a medieval journey where survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the perils of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike the medieval knights of old, Eva relied on sophisticated technology, but the thrill of exploration, the vastness of space, and the sheer audacity of her mission echoed the spirit of adventure that has captivated humanity across the ages.
