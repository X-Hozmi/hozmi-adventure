
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation were less daunting than the unknown that lay beyond the next ridge – the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold secrets older than the kingdoms themselves.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of discovery, or demise.  The journey was perilous, but the lure of the unknown fueled her onward, a stubborn ember against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike any encountered before.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Unlike the medieval adventurers before her, Eva had advanced technology at her disposal, but the challenges were no less significant – navigating treacherous wormholes, deciphering alien signals, and facing the ever-present unknown that lay beyond the reach of even the most advanced sensors.
