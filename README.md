
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Eadwine, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were commonplace, the forests teemed with wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-shifting sands of the desert. Yet, the promise of divine grace and the thrill of the unknown spurred them onward, their resolve hardened by every hardship faced.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable forces of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vast, uncharted cosmos held both wonder and terror, with each jump to warp speed a gamble against the unknown. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of new worlds and civilizations, fueled her insatiable thirst for adventure.
