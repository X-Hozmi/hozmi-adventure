
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease clung to the air like a miasma, and the unpredictable weather threatened to swallow him whole. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge: fording raging rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager sustenance in squalid villages. Yet, the lure of the exotic East, the whispered tales of silks and spices, fueled his relentless progress, a single flickering candle against the vast, uncertain darkness.


Centuries later, Elara piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering void between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The journey was less physically demanding than Thomas's, but the challenges were no less daunting.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the ever-present threat of solar flares demanded constant vigilance.  But unlike Thomas, Elara possessed technology that bent the very fabric of spacetime, making the impossible, almost routine, even if the loneliness of the vast cosmos was a constant companion.
