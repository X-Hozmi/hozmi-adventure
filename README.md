His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience as he pressed further into the unknown, his heart pounding with the thrill of the journey and the desperate hope of finding what he sought.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the Kepler-186f system.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet unforgiving, was her domain.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and repairing critical systems under the relentless gaze of distant stars were all part of her daily routine.   The promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, fuelled her relentless pursuit across the galaxy, a modern-day explorer pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
