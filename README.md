
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of St. Michael.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her treacherous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast distances and the immense technological marvel that allowed her to traverse the galaxy. While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the thrill of discovery and the unknown burned just as brightly as it had for Elara, centuries before.
