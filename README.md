
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of craggy mountains, while scorching deserts threatened to consume them whole.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous rivers, bartering with suspicious villagers, and outwitting cunning desert nomads.  Their determination, however, burned brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling space pirates were commonplace occurrences on their mission to locate the legendary Xylos system, a cluster of planets said to possess a source of unlimited energy.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of fear than the medieval wilds, a cosmic loneliness punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional burst of enemy fire.  Yet, the promise of discovery propelled them onward, a beacon in the inky blackness.
