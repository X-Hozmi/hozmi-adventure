
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under the overcast sky, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became routine as the vast emptiness of space pressed in.  But the potential reward – a breakthrough that could reshape galactic civilization – spurred Eva and her crew onwards, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
