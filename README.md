
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him. His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  But the hope of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him onward despite the peril.  He carried with him not only his sword, but the weight of his people's fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a one-way trip to a potential new home for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding hostile alien patrols was a daily test of skill and nerve.  Unlike Reginald's medieval journey, Eva faced dangers unseen, threats that defied earthly comprehension. Yet, the same burning determination fueled her – the will to survive, to explore, and to secure a future for her people among the stars.
