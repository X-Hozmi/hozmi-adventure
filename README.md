
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and damp earth, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Black Forest, promising both peril and untold riches.  He carried with him a King's decree, a whispered map promising a lost monastery brimming with forgotten lore, and a heart filled with the reckless ambition of youth.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger of the wilderness all stood between him and his goal, each challenge a potential end, or a step closer to glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable emptiness of space.  Asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were ever-present dangers, but the promise of a new life, a fresh start on a vibrant alien world, fueled her unwavering determination.
