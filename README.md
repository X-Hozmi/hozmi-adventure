
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched earth, the midday sun a merciless judge.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a whisper on the wind from her dying grandmother, had taken her through bandit-infested passes, across scorching deserts, and into the heart of unforgiving mountains.  Each sunrise brought fresh peril – the threat of starvation, dehydration, or the blade of some unscrupulous mercenary – yet the allure of the unknown, the possibility of finding something beyond the mundane, spurred her onward.  This was a pilgrimage, a trial by fire, and a testament to the enduring human spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across the Andromeda galaxy centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory graviton storms of the outer reaches, Jaxx relied on his crew's skill and the aging ship's temperamental hyperdrive.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and deadly unknowns, tested their courage and resourcefulness every lightyear. The reward, the hope of finding a lost civilization, fueled their relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
