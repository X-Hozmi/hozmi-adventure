The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear; rumors of bandits infested the King's Road, and the heavy pouch of gold Thomas carried for his lord weighed heavily on his conscience, and his saddle. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a constant reminder of the perilous journey before him – a journey to deliver the gold and secure his family's future.

But the vastness of space, its unpredictable dangers and the loneliness of interstellar travel, were a constant companion, a palpable reminder of the bravery, and the sheer gamble, involved in seeking out a new beginning amongst the stars.
