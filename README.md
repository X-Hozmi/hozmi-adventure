
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, pinned to a cryptic map promising untold riches in the far east.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumour of bandits in the night, fueled the thrill of her adventure, a gamble against famine and fate itself for a life beyond the impoverished village she'd left behind.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course charted across lightyears to a rumored lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the immense distances and unimaginable dangers he faced.  But the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover a civilization lost to time, outweighed the risk, a siren song echoing across the vast emptiness of space.
