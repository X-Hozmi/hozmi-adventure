
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the already fading light. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of saving their kingdom from a devastating plague.  Each day brought its own peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria and the hope it offered fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling temporal anomalies were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva.  The vastness of space held both incredible wonders and terrifying unknowns, but the promise of finding Xylos, and perhaps even forging a new future for humanity, spurred her onward across the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
