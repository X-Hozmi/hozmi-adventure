
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully in the fading light, urged his weary steed onward.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across whispering forests teeming with unseen dangers, and over rivers swollen with the spring thaw. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadows, sudden storms, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume them all.  Yet, the lure of the lost city, whispered of in ancient texts, fuelled their desperate journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships disguised as space debris, and battling the ever-present threat of solar flares were all part of a typical day for a galactic freighter captain.  The vast, indifferent expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying peril, testing the limits of both technology and human resilience.
