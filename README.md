
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights crested the hill, their worn leather armor gleaming faintly in the harsh afternoon sun. Before them stretched the endless expanse of the Ardennes forest, a tapestry of green and brown under the vast, indifferent sky.  Their quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Aquitaine, bearing a vital message that could decide the fate of a war.  Each day brought new challenges - treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril and hardship, but also with the thrill of the unknown and the camaraderie forged in the face of shared danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The ship, a marvel of advanced technology, hummed with the energy of its hyperdrive, pushing them towards the Andromeda galaxy, billions of light-years from their home planet. Their mission: to chart unexplored star systems and search for habitable worlds.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the silent majesty of celestial bodies contrasted with the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering unforeseen anomalies in the fabric of space-time itself. Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble on the future of humanity.
