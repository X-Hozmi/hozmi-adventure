
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored monastery at Montserrat, a sanctuary whispered to hold ancient secrets, but the journey promised bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each step was a gamble, each sunrise a fragile victory in her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll Empire demanded skill bordering on the impossible.  The crew, a motley collection of explorers and smugglers, relied on Ryla’s intuition and the ship's aging hyperdrive, their courage fueled by the allure of discovery and the promise of a future unbound by the limitations of space.
