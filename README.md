
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, spurred him on, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown lands stretching before him.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival on a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils – unpredictable spacetime distortions, pirate raids, and the chilling emptiness of interstellar space.  But the vastness of the cosmos, the potential for discovery, fueled her unwavering determination, a beacon guiding her through the infinite darkness.
