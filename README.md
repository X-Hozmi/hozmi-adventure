
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, was far more perilous than the king's messengers had anticipated. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whisper of plague hung heavy in the air alongside the scent of sweat and fear.  Each creak of their saddle leather, each rustle of the dry grass, was a potential harbinger of death, transforming their journey into a constant struggle for survival against both man and nature.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of gas and starlight concealing untold dangers.  Her mission, to retrieve a rare element from the ice planet of Kryos, was fraught with technological challenges and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Warp drives hummed, sensors beeped warnings of approaching asteroids, and the vast, unknowable expanse of space pressed in on them, reminding her of the sheer audacity and vulnerability of humanity venturing into the galactic unknown.
