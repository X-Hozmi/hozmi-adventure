
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had been fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve, but the promise of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigation through the treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the vastness of space itself.  The loneliness, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the distant whispers of cosmic radiation, was a different kind of hardship than any land-bound adventurer had ever faced.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to find a lost civilization, kept Ryla’s spirit soaring among the stars.
