
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I rode towards the Spine of the World, a mountain range rumored to hold a lost city of gold.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of powerful artifacts and forgotten magic, pushed me onward, a lone speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled my ears as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside my viewport were more breathtaking than any earthly vista, the constellations utterly alien and breathtakingly beautiful.  Our mission: to chart unexplored systems in search of habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth. The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, extraterrestrial life.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of a new beginning for humanity, drove us across the boundless expanse of space.
