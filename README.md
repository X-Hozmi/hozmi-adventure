
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Dust coated his throat and sweat stung his eyes, but the thrill of the unknown spurred him on.  He carried a king's desperate plea across treacherous mountain passes and sprawling forests, a journey fraught with bandit ambushes, river crossings swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, each sunset the fragile hope of reaching his destination before winter's grip tightened its icy hold.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time, but the dangers remained constant: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Her mission, to deliver vital life-sustaining resources to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, demanded unwavering focus and courage.  The stars themselves seemed to test her resolve, yet the promise of salvation for a distant world fueled her every decision.
