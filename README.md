
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys, a quest for a lost healing herb whispered of in ancient texts, had tested her endurance beyond measure.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger had all been faced with grit and a stubborn refusal to give up. The whispered legends, however, promised a reward worth more than all the hardships combined.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her home world.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of space-borne anomalies were commonplace dangers.  Yet, the allure of exploration, the thrill of discovering the unknown amidst the vast, breathtaking expanse of space, kept her spirit soaring.
