
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band crested the hill, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before them. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each step was a gamble – bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, wild beasts roamed the unforgiving highlands, and the whispers of ancient magic clung to the very stones.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the constant, gnawing fear of the unknown.  Survival itself was their greatest adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms were mere inconveniences compared to the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself. The vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, demanding constant vigilance and unwavering courage. The ultimate prize, however, was the hope of finding a lost civilization and uncovering the secrets of the anomaly.
