The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, snaked ahead, promising both peril and reward.  Whispers of a hidden monastery, brimming with ancient texts and untold riches, fueled his journey.

Yet, the promise of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries, propelled her and her crew forward into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
