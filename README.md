
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a faint comfort against the biting wind.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing shrine of Saint Brigid, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation tested her resolve daily. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of courage, and a renewed hope of finding solace and healing at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of iridescent gas, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the navigation console.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps across unimaginable distances were punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the eerie silence of interstellar space. The dangers weren't bandits or starvation, but rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any help.
