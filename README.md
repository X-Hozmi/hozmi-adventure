
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Venice, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our worn leather boots.  Ahead lay a treacherous path across the Alps, rumored to be haunted by brigands and snowstorms.  We carried with us only our meager supplies, our wits, and a map as old and fragile as parchment itself; our destination, the mythical city of Samarkand, a whispered promise of untold riches and adventure. Each creak of the wagon wheel, each rustle in the forest, held the thrill of the unknown, the potential for both glorious triumph and devastating failure.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the silence between stars.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, orbiting a red dwarf sun. We, a crew of explorers aboard a vessel built for the vastness of space, faced not bandits but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the alien landscapes of unexplored worlds.  The thrill was different, the challenges more vast, but the same spirit of daring adventure pulsed through our veins as our ship cut a path through the cosmos, a tiny speck of hope against the breathtaking, terrifying grandeur of the galaxy.
