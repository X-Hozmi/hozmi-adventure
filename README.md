
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping at my cloak as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead lay the promised lands of the East, rumored to hold silks finer than moonlight and spices that could cure any ailment.  Each creak of the packhorse, each rustle in the snow-laden pines, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of distant cultures and untold riches, spurred me onward.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant color as we jumped between galaxies, leaving the familiar spiral arm of the Milky Way behind. Our mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a swirling tempest of gas and dust said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, civilizations. But the potential reward, a revolution in interstellar travel, was a prize worth risking everything for.
