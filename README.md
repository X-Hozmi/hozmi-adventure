
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zamora, whispered to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the trials she faced, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of uncertainty and the unwavering resolve to continue her quest.  The air was thick with the scent of pine and the distant cries of wolves, a soundtrack to her solitary adventure across a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Vast distances and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were the constant companions on her voyage across the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown where unforeseen celestial events and hostile alien encounters were commonplace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a different kind of challenge to the medieval adventurer, replacing the bandits with sentient asteroid fields and the starvation with the slow creep of oxygen depletion.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of the known universe, burned as brightly as any medieval knight’s zeal.
