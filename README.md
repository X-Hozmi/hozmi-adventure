
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Each sunrise brought a renewed test of endurance, each sunset a desperate hope for shelter and survival.  Her only companions were a battered map, a loyal dog, and the unwavering glint of adventure in her eyes.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted wormholes threatened to rip her ship apart, pirate factions patrolled the lucrative trade routes, and the ever-present threat of spaceborne anomalies kept her crew on edge. The journey to the fabled planet of Aethel, rich with untold resources and ancient secrets, was a gamble, but the potential rewards outweighed the risks for the intrepid crew. The vastness of space offered limitless possibilities, but with each jump to hyperspace, they wagered their lives on the unpredictable whims of the cosmos.
