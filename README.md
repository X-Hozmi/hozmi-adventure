
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of reaching Zerzura, fueled by his love for his sister, propelled him forward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps sent jolts through the ship, while the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation and rogue asteroids tested the crew's mettle.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration, and the possibility of discovering a new civilization, pushed them ever deeper into the inky blackness, their tiny vessel a beacon of human ambition against the boundless expanse of space.
