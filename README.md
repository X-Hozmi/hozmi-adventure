
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged, snow-dusted peaks as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril – not only the unforgiving elements, but also the ever-present threat of bandits and the whispered legends of monstrous creatures lurking in the shadowed valleys.  Each creaking step of their weary mounts brought them closer to the mythical Sunstone, a relic said to hold unimaginable power, and closer to the edge of their endurance.  The promise of glory and untold riches, however, fueled their desperate advance.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and the unpredictable quantum currents that threatened to rip their ship apart.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown lifeforms and guarded by ancient, technologically advanced sentinels.  The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the risks they faced, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the fabric of spacetime itself.  The fate of humanity might rest on their shoulders, a burden light years heavier than any physical weight.
