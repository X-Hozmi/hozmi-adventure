
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the muddy track swallowed by the encroaching twilight.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort from our exhausted mounts, echoed the anxieties in our hearts.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and dangers alike.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just a few of the obstacles separating us from our goal – a desperate gamble for fortune and survival in a world ruled by feudal lords and fickle fate.


Millennia later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The crimson nebula of Xylos blazed outside the viewport as the Althea, our generation starship, jumped between galaxies.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from our own dying sun. Our mission, a desperate search for a new home for humanity, carried the weight of billions of hopes and fears.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional flicker of a distant star, was both breathtaking and terrifying, a constant reminder of our fragility against the cosmic expanse.
