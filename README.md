
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a pungent mix of ale and desperation clinging to our roughspun tunics.  Ahead lay the sun-baked plains of France, then the treacherous Alps, a gauntlet of icy passes and unpredictable weather.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the relentless gnawing of hunger, and the constant threat of disease.  Yet, with every league covered, the thrill of the unknown spurred us onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.  Our destination, the fabled city of Constantinople, held the promise of untold riches and unimaginable wonders, a dream worth risking everything to achieve.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our destination, Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star, lay light-years away but within reach of our advanced technology.  The breathtaking nebulae outside our viewport shifted in a kaleidoscope of impossible colours, a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the ship's interior.  While the journey itself presented few physical dangers, the mental strain of interstellar travel was immense, the vast emptiness both awe-inspiring and isolating.  But the hope of discovering new life, of expanding humanity’s reach beyond the cradle of Earth, fuelled our relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
