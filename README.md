
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The journey from York to Constantinople was proving far more arduous than the tapestries in the King's hall had suggested.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud and ice, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Silk Road, of untold riches and exotic spices, fueled his weary steps, a beacon in the bleak expanse of his adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The jump to Kepler-186f was complete, the swirling nebulae a breathtaking spectacle outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored planet and search for habitable zones.  The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval landscape, held its own unique brand of peril: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present danger of mechanical failure light years from any rescue.  But the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, was a reward worth any risk.
