The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village he'd left behind. His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure.  Each creak of his saddle, each flash of steel from a passing knight, punctuated the relentless journey across the unforgiving terrain, a tapestry woven with danger and the unwavering hope of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, a beacon in the vast, inky expanse of the cosmos.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the distant crackle of subspace comms, were the constant companions of her interstellar voyage.  The risks were astronomical – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the potential reward, a new home for humanity, spurred her onward.
