
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than her hopes.  She was bound for the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of healing, a desperate quest fueled by her brother's lingering fever.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – yet the lure of the unknown propelled her onward.

Centuries hence, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in the starship *Stardust*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess the elusive "Aetherium," a substance capable of powering faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with perils – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Jax, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, held fast to his course, driven by the insatiable human hunger for discovery and the promise of a future beyond the known galaxy.
