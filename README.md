
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier to his quest.  He carried a king's ransom in smuggled spices and a desperate hope to reach the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's icy grip choked the mountain passes. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, each day a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Conversely, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the ancient whispers of the Galactic Concordance.  Ahead, the shimmering jewel of the K'tharr homeworld beckoned, a prize coveted for its unique energy source.  Her journey was fraught with peril too, but of a different kind:  uncharted wormholes, hostile pirate factions, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  Each jump was a leap of faith into the unknown, a testament to the boundless courage needed for interstellar exploration.
