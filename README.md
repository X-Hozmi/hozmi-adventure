
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of thyme and impending storm clinging to the air. Her worn map, a testament to countless rips and repairs, guided her towards the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the secret to a potent healing balm.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, an exoplanet promising untold riches in rare minerals and a new chapter in human colonization.  The journey was a perilous dance through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  Unlike Elara's journey limited by the earth's bounds, Rexx's voyage encompassed light-years and the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the universe.
