
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary men, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches in Cathay, fuels our relentless westward journey.  We are pilgrims on a path fraught with peril, but driven by a thirst for adventure that transcends the hardship.

Conversely, in the 27th century,  Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Starseeker*, across the vast emptiness between galaxies. Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy.  Instead of bandits, she faces the unpredictable hazards of nebulae and wormholes, and the silent threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  While the scale is unimaginable compared to a medieval journey, the spirit of adventure – the courage to face the unknown, to push the boundaries of the known – remains the same potent driving force.
