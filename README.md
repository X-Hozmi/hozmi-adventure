
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city of gold, said to be guarded by mythical beasts.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-scorched plains, treacherous mountain passes, and encounters with suspicious travelers and even more suspicious forest creatures.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, yet each sunset brought the unwavering hope of reaching Eldoria, a hope fueled by whispered legends and the glint of gold in his ever-present dreams.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by the warp storm decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational tides and avoiding pirate scavengers was a daily challenge, each hyperspace jump a gamble with the fabric of spacetime itself.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos stretched endlessly before her, a testament to the scale of the universe and the relentless drive of humanity to explore its furthest reaches, despite the overwhelming odds.
