
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a punctuation mark in her arduous journey to the fabled city of Samarkand.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unpredictable weather threatened both her and her meager supplies. Yet, the whispered legends of Samarkand's silks and spices, the chance to escape the stifling expectations of her village, fueled her onward, despite the perils of the unknown road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago. Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents and dodging rogue asteroid fields, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's aging technology.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and a profound loneliness, but the possibility of rediscovering lost humanity, of uncovering a forgotten history, made the risk worthwhile.
