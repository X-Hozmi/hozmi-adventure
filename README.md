
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary steed onward, the creak of leather and groan of saddle a constant companion.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the far-off monastery of St. Jude, had already taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and through dense forests whispering with unseen dangers. Each sunrise brought new challenges – the threat of starvation, the ever-present risk of ambush, and the gnawing uncertainty of the path ahead.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and hidden dangers. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was a daily routine.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, and the vastness of space, a constant reminder of her isolation.  But the vast unknown, brimming with untold possibilities, beckoned her onward, a siren song only a true explorer could resist.
