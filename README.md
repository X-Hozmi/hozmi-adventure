His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both horse and rider, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any man. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his steps, pushing him ever closer to the unknown.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against dwindling supplies and the ever-present threat of space pirates.

The fate of a civilization rested on her navigational skills and the unwavering courage of her crew.
