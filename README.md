
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril, a constant test of endurance and cunning.  The endless expanse of land, dotted with crumbling castles and haunted forests, was a tapestry woven with both beauty and brutality, a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hyperspace jump, a vibrant kaleidoscope of swirling colours and impossible geometries, was a thrilling, if slightly nauseating, experience.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, searching for habitable planets and potential new trade routes.  The vastness of space, punctuated by shimmering nebulae and the icy glow of distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Unlike the medieval era's dangers, Ryla faced threats that were alien and unknown, a battle for survival against the infinite.
