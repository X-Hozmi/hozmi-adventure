
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snakes across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the unpredictable wrath of nature, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every creak of our wagons and every beat of our weary horses' hooves, we inch closer to our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, a jewel shimmering on the horizon of a vast and unknown world.  The air hums with the unspoken hopes and fears of those seeking fortune, redemption, or simply a better life beyond the familiar.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a generation ship the size of a small moon, carries us across the gulf of interstellar space towards Kepler-186f.  We are pioneers, explorers charting the unknown vastness of the cosmos, navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, our destination a planet potentially teeming with life, both wondrous and terrifying. Each hyperspace jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable embrace of the galaxy.  Our legacy, etched in the stardust and echoing across light years, will be the courage to reach for the furthest stars.
