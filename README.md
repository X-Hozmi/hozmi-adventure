
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each treacherous river crossing, each fleeting glimpse of a hawk circling high above, fueled his determination. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a perilous gamble against time and fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light jumps were punctuated by the eerie silence of deep space and the occasional, terrifying encounter with unknown celestial phenomena.  The weight of her crew's lives, the promise of discovery, and the haunting mystery of New Eden’s disappearance pushed Eva to the limits of her endurance, a journey far more perilous than any medieval expedition, yet equally driven by hope and unwavering resolve.
