
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crested the ridge.  Before them stretched the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, a daunting obstacle on their journey to Santiago de Compostela.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions.  Yet, the promise of the holy city, and the whispered tales of miracles performed there, spurred her onward. Each aching muscle, each bite of meager rations, fueled a stubborn hope that burned brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth. The journey was fraught with perils far exceeding any mountain pass; asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders patrolling the void. But the lure of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, outweighed the risks.  Each jump through hyperspace, each narrowly avoided collision, brought them closer to a future yet unwritten.
