The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Ahead lay the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and even more dangerous secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but small inconveniences compared to the glory awaiting him – or the gruesome demise that could just as easily claim him.

But the promise of discovering new life, mapping uncharted territories, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled her unwavering determination.  The cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, held secrets waiting to be unveiled.
