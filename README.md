
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – a precious cargo for a monastery far to the north.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the whisper of the wind through the cypress trees and the sight of distant, snow-capped peaks fueled her relentless journey, a testament to the human spirit’s enduring capacity for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula, the crimson glow of distant quasars painting the cockpit of the 'Stardust Drifter'. His mission: to locate the mythical planet Xylia, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking against gravitational tides, a stark contrast to Elara's humble journey.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the relentless pursuit of a seemingly impossible goal, bound these two adventurers across time – a shared spirit of exploration echoing through the ages.
