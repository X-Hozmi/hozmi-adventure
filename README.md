
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the relentless march of disease.  Yet, the lure of the mythical City of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, drives us onward.  We brave treacherous mountain passes, ford icy rivers, and navigate dense, shadowy forests, fueled by hope and a shared thirst for the unknown.  The journey itself is the adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship and camaraderie, shaping us as much as the destination might.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The sleek, silver vessel, 'Stardust Drifter,' hums beneath my feet as we slingshot around a gas giant, its swirling colours a breathtaking spectacle.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a potential cradle of life light years from Earth.  The dangers are different now – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of engine failure – but the thrill remains.  Each jump through hyperspace is a leap into the void, a gamble against the infinite, pushing the boundaries of human exploration further than ever before.
