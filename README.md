
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his mount onward, the relentless sun beating down on the dusty track.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it offered, spurred him relentlessly across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a perilous journey across the Andromeda Galaxy, to retrieve a vital energy source for her dying homeworld.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were mere inconveniences compared to the vast, unknowable wonders and dangers of the cosmos.  Each jump through the void brought her closer to her goal, and to a potential future for her people.
