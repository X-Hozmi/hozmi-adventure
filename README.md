
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, crawled across the sun-baked plains.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of the unknown beyond the next dune. Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones around crackling campfires, propelled us onward.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant landscape, making the journey as much a test of mental fortitude as physical endurance.  We sought not gold, but a legendary healing balm, a desperate hope against the encroaching plague.

Centuries later, the *Starseeker* shuddered as it jumped through hyperspace, a pinpoint of light against the inky canvas of the cosmos.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to harbor the last vestiges of the ancient Proxima Centauri civilization.  The risks were astronomical, from rogue asteroids to unpredictable wormholes, but the promise of unlocking lost technologies, of understanding the fate of a vanished people, outweighed any danger.  The thrill of interstellar exploration pulsed through the crew, a potent mix of exhilaration and terror as we hurtled toward the unknown depths of the galaxy.
