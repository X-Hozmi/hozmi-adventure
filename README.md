
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her mule laden with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the ever-present tension.  Her quest – to reach the legendary city of Zerzura rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother – pushes her onward, despite the lurking dangers of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The sun bleeds across the horizon, painting the jagged peaks in fiery hues, a breathtaking but fleeting beauty in the face of her perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, a sleek vessel piercing the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive lulls her into a state of tense vigilance; the vastness of space holds unknown dangers, from rogue asteroids to unforeseen celestial anomalies.  But the thrill of discovery, the hope of finding new life and charting unmapped territories, fuels her courage as she navigates the cosmic ocean, a journey far removed from the medieval paths but equally fraught with risk and reward.
