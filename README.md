
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in his gloved hand.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the ongoing plague.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are his constant companions, testing his courage and resolve at every turn.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new peril, and each sunset the grim possibility that Ys remains only a legend.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  Beyond the familiar constellations lie uncharted nebulae and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Fuel reserves dwindle with each hyperspace jump, and the ship's aging systems creak under the strain of interstellar travel.  Elara's mission: to locate a rumored source of Xylium, a rare element vital to saving her dying home planet. The vast emptiness of space is as daunting as any medieval wilderness, and the unknown awaits with both wonder and terrifying possibilities.
