
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm mixing in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, rivers ran treacherous and swollen with spring thaw, and the whispers of djinn and monstrous beasts haunted the nights.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, a new vista of breathtaking beauty that fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been treacherous, the wormhole unstable, spitting them out light-years off course. Now, battling solar flares and navigating asteroid fields, Jax and her crew faced the vast unknown, their mission – the search for a new habitable world – a gamble against the odds of interstellar space.  The adventure was not just in the destination, but in the perilous journey itself.
