
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Yet, with each creak of saddle leather and rise of the sun, her resolve hardened.  The rumors of Saragossa's hidden libraries, filled with forgotten knowledge, spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Navigation through uncharted galaxies was a symphony of calculated risk and breathtaking wonder.  Each jump through hyperspace brought them closer to the rumored Proxima Centauri colony, a haven for those fleeing the crumbling galactic empire.  Though the void between stars was a lonely expanse, punctuated only by the hum of the ship’s engines and the occasional cosmic flare, the allure of a new beginning, a new world, fueled their relentless pursuit across the vast canvas of space.
