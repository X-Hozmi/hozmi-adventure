
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bit at Sir Kaelan's face as he urged his weary horse onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless rain.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged King – was a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild animals. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, reminding him of the countless dangers lurking in the shadows of the medieval world.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, but the reward – the safety of his King – spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: the Kepler-186f system, a potential colony site light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and battling solar flares was routine, but the thrill of exploration, the sheer audacity of venturing into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy, never faded. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a constant allure, a promise of discovery and a humbling reminder of humanity's fragile place in the cosmos.  Every jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown, but for Eva, the rewards far outweighed the risks.
