
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band crested the hill, the sun beating down on their worn leather and chainmail.  Ahead lay the Whispering Woods, a legendary expanse said to be haunted by sprites and worse.  Their quest: to reach the distant city of Porthaven, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each step was a gamble; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked them, making their journey a desperate race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva faced dangers far beyond anything a medieval knight could imagine.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies fueled her relentless pursuit across the vast emptiness of space.
