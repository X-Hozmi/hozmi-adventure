
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Elara, was far from the romanticized tales sung in taverns.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the relentless churn of their horses' hooves, the gnawing hunger in their bellies, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought the promise of another arduous league, a precarious dance between hope and despair under the vast, indifferent sky.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and incandescent gas was a far cry from the muddy tracks of Kaelan’s journey.  Yet, the challenges remained: unpredictable spatial anomalies, the constant hum of failing engines, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, the vastness of the cosmos both exhilarating and terrifying in its boundless expanse.
