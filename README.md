
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had etched lines onto his face, mirroring the rugged landscape he traversed.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary sigh from his exhausted horse, was a testament to their arduous journey across the treacherous highlands.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation were but small price to pay for the rumored riches awaiting them in the distant kingdom of Eldoria – a land said to be paved with gold and guarded by mythical beasts.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, terrifying silence of space.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions were challenges as perilous as any medieval knight faced, but the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, spurred her onward.  The galaxy was her battlefield, and exploration her ultimate conquest.
