
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of magic and forgotten empires, fueled his relentless journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite black. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Cygnus X-1 nebula, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the unpredictable gravitational forces of nascent stars was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of intergalactic travel permits and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vastness of space, however, held a beauty and wonder that mirrored the allure of the medieval world’s unknown territories, each new planet a promise of discovery.
