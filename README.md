
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadow of brooding forests haunted by bandits and worse. Each day brought new challenges –  negotiating with wary villagers, fording swollen rivers on rickety rafts, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of danger.  Their destination felt as mythical as the legends themselves, yet the lure of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the predatory drones of the Kryll, and repairing warp core breaches became routine amidst the breathtaking cosmic vistas. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted depths of the cosmos,  the ultimate test of courage and ingenuity in a universe both magnificent and terrifying.
