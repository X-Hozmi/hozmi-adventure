
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s worn boots as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn map, a tattered piece of parchment, offers little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sends a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurk beyond the next hill.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, fuels her relentless journey.  The quest for fortune, or perhaps something more, keeps her pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vast emptiness of space, peppered with the shimmering light of distant galaxies, is a different kind of wilderness, but no less perilous.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the ever-present risk of asteroid fields and pirate attacks.  Her mission: to locate a legendary artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a prize that could change the fate of humanity, but one that demands a daring journey across the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
