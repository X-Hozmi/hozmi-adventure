
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness of the Ardennes Forest, rumored to be home to bandits and worse.  Her leather-bound map, worn and faded, was her only guide as she journeyed towards the distant city of Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by a desperate hope and a knapsack filled with meager supplies. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, transforming the journey into a constant test of courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent light.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void, bound for Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away promising a bounty of rare minerals.  The journey, though measured in light-speed jumps rather than days, was still fraught with peril.  Nebula storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept the crew on high alert. The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and utterly terrifying, served as a constant reminder of the immense risks and equally immense rewards of interstellar travel.
