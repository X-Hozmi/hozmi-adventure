His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of gold in his imagination, and the whispered tales of Zerzura's wonders, spurred him onward, a solitary speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the expanding nebula decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous currents of space, dodging asteroid fields and battling unpredictable gravitational pulls, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond those of any medieval knight. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held its own untold mysteries and the hope – or the terror – of discovering what fate befell the lost colonists.
