
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of St. Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed. Yet, with each sunrise, they pressed further, driven by faith and the promise of adventure, their meager supplies and battered armor testaments to their arduous trek across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage of unimaginable scale and danger.  Asteroids the size of mountains loomed in the void, unpredictable wormholes twisted spacetime, and the threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations was ever-present.  But the lure of discovery, of charting the unknown corners of the cosmos, spurred her onward, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion on her lonely, epic journey among the stars.
