
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her family's hopes.  Bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, and the biting wind whispers tales of mythical beasts guarding forgotten trails.  Yet, the promise of a new life in the fertile lands beyond the mountains fuels her onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge, each encounter a potential lifeline or deadly threat in this perilous journey across a medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the alien light of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, mapping nebulae and searching for habitable planets amid the swirling cosmic dust.  The vast emptiness of space offers both sublime beauty and terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach among the stars, drives her ever forward on this epic voyage across the interstellar sea.
