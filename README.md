
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her weathered face.  Her journey across the harsh, unforgiving plains of Anatolia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling ruins, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the dangers that lay between her and her destination – a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The vastness of the landscape mirrored the daunting task ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The breathtaking cosmic vistas, however, were a stunning reward, a constant reminder of the boundless wonders – and equally boundless dangers – of interstellar travel.  The vastness of space, unlike the medieval plains, held the promise of discovery and a future far beyond human comprehension.
