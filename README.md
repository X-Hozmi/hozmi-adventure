
Sir Reginald, his armor dulled by weeks of relentless travel, spurred his weary steed onward.  The muddy track wound through a dense, primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and unseen things.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through him.  He was on a perilous quest, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold the key to ending a devastating plague, facing bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing fear of the unknown at every turn.  His only companions were his loyal sword and the fading light of the setting sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colors a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling to survive on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing vital systems during hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space held a different kind of fear than a medieval forest, the loneliness of the cosmos an ever-present companion on her perilous journey among the stars.
