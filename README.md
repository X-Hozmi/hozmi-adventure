
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, guided his destrier through the muddy track.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields bordering the road, held the potential for ambush or adventure.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispers of mythical beasts haunted the travelers’ tales around crackling campfires at night.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone – felt as daunting as the endless, unforgiving landscape itself.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble for the precious Xylossian crystals needed to power Earth's dwindling energy reserves.  The vast, inky expanse held dangers far beyond brigands and wild animals: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters, some potentially hostile.  The galaxy stretched before her, an ocean of stars promising both untold riches and certain death.
