
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a perilous cargo that demanded she brave bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new brush with fate; the vastness of the unknown land both terrified and exhilarated her. This journey, more than any treasure, was her true reward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the starship *Stardust* through the Andromeda Galaxy, its hyperdrive a hum against the deafening silence of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the political minefields of intergalactic trade routes were daily hazards, far removed from the mundane dangers of Elara's time.  Yet, the thrill remained; the vastness of space, the alien landscapes of newly discovered planets, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown life forms, all fueled the insatiable hunger for exploration that burned within her, echoing across the millennia from Elara's own courageous spirit.
