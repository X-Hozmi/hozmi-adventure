
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track wound through the dense Black Forest, a tapestry of ancient oaks and whispering shadows.  His quest: to recover the stolen Orb of Aethelred, a relic said to hold the power of kings.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in the ravines, treacherous bogs threatening to swallow man and beast whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him relentlessly toward his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were but minor inconveniences compared to the vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy.  Each jump through the void held the promise of discovery, or the chilling possibility of encountering something far beyond human comprehension. The weight of responsibility for her crew rested heavy, yet the allure of exploration, of pushing humanity's boundaries, burned brightly within her.
