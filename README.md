The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, whispered to hold the power to heal the ailing king.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  But the lure of glory and the hope of saving his kingdom fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered little comfort, but the possibility of reuniting with lost kin and uncovering the colony's fate drove her ever onward, a lone beacon of hope in the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
