
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Shrine of Saint Elara (a namesake coincidence she often pondered), had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over rivers swollen with spring melt. Each sunrise brought the promise of new perils – starvation, disease, or the ever-present threat of warring lords – but also the thrill of unknown lands and the chance to meet people as diverse and resilient as the land itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic tapestry.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had already taken generations, a multi-generational voyage fueled by cryogenic sleep and the unwavering hope of finding a new home amongst the stars.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates – the spirit of adventure remained the same, a burning desire to push the boundaries of the known universe and discover what lay beyond the reach of human understanding.
