
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, suspicious villagers, and the ever-present threat of bandits. Yet, the allure of Ys, the whisper of its healing powers, pushed her relentlessly forward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey fraught with unpredictable wormholes and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of galaxies spiraling into oblivion, but the loneliness of space, the weight of responsibility, and the ever-present hum of the ship's engines reminded him of the risks inherent in his profession.
