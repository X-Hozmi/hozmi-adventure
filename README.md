
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mare across the parched plains of Castile.  Ahead, the Pyrenees loom, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, famine, or the far more terrifying whispers of the plague that stalks the land.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to her exiled brother, demands courage and resilience, qualities forged in the fires of a life lived on the unforgiving edges of medieval Europe.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, breaches the nebula’s crimson veil.  Ahead lies Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  But the galaxy is a dangerous place, riddled with pirate fleets, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of the Kryll, a sentient energy being that feeds on starlight.  Ryla, hardened by years navigating treacherous space lanes, knows this journey demands more than just piloting skill – it demands a heart forged in the crucible of interstellar exploration and a mind prepared for the unimaginable.
