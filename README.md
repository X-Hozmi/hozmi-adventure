
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a daunting but necessary passage to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  My meager supplies dwindled with every passing day, matched only by the growing gnawing fear of bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving wilderness itself.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient secrets fueled my weary spirit, urging me onward into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a familiar comfort against the endless void of space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity amongst the stars.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Cygnus X-1 region was a nail-biting affair, the ship shuddering under the impact of stray space rocks.  But the thought of discovering new life, charting unmapped constellations, and expanding the reach of human civilization far outweighed the inherent risks.  The cosmos beckoned, a boundless ocean of adventure awaiting exploration.
