
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was a brutal one,  days bleeding into weeks of relentless travel.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of disease were merely inconveniences compared to the gnawing loneliness of the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a renewed hope of reaching the holy city, a hope tempered by the ever-present awareness of the journey's perils.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless consultations, his only guide through the labyrinth of unknown roads.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, while technologically advanced, held a similar sense of isolation.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling pinpricks of distant stars, was a different kind of wilderness.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate factions required a skill set as honed as any medieval knight's, and the loneliness of deep space was a constant companion. The promise of a new world, a new colony on the far side of the galaxy, fuelled her relentless push towards the unknown, a modern-day quest echoing through the millennia.
