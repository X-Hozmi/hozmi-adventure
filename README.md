
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of Constantinople, and the rumored lost scrolls held within its libraries, fueled her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, was a potential threat, but also a promise of untold discoveries.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  The vastness of space, peppered with the glittering pinpricks of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic radiation and unpredictable gravitational forces, each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  But the potential rewards – first contact, the expansion of human knowledge – outweighed the risks, propelling Eva and her crew further into the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
