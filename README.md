
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of fiery orange and blood red.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes were constant threats, but the lure of adventure, fueled by tales from wandering merchants and cryptic maps, pushed her further into the unknown.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of excitement, danger, and perhaps, glory.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a long-lost colony ship believed to have discovered a habitable planet beyond the known galaxies.  Warp jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and pirate attacks a constant worry. Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories among the stars, and uncovering the secrets of the cosmos fuelled her tireless journey across the vast expanse of space. Each jump into hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite.
