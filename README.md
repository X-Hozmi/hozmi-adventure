
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the fading light, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden lands of Albion had been arduous. Days bled into weeks, marked by meager rations, sleepless nights spent huddled around dwindling fires, and the ever-present threat of ambush.  Yet, the whispered legends of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold untold power, spurred him onwards, a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.  Each creak of his saddle, each clop of hooves, was a step closer to destiny, or perhaps, ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but the hyperspace rift left her engines sputtering, low on power and dangerously close to a rogue planetoid.  Ahead lay the fabled Cygnus Cluster, a rumored paradise brimming with resources and ancient technologies. The dangers of interstellar travel – radiation storms, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors – were constant companions, but the promise of untold discoveries pushed Elara and her crew relentlessly toward the unknown, across the vast gulf between galaxies.
