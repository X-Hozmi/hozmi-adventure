Each creak of the wagon wheels, each snort from her weary mule, was a measure of the distance to the fabled city of Granada, rumored to hold secrets lost to time. Bandits, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies were constant threats, but the promise of adventure – and perhaps a king's ransom in silks – spurred her onward. The whispers of ancient magic woven into the very fabric of the land fueled her relentless journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of warp drives were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like her. The vastness of space, teeming with both wonder and danger, tested the limits of her courage and technology, as she pushed humanity's reach further into the cosmos, seeking not gold, but knowledge and the possibility of a new home for mankind.
