
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of France was far from the idyllic pilgrimage she'd envisioned.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver of apprehension down her spine.  Yet, the allure of the rumored healing spring, whispered about in hushed tones in her village, spurred her onward, a beacon of hope in this harsh and unforgiving landscape.  She carried with her not only meager supplies, but the weight of her family's prayers and the unshakeable belief that the journey's end held the promise of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson and gold dust a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of his cockpit. His mission: to deliver vital terraforming algae to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potential but lacking the life-sustaining elements necessary for human survival.  The jump to hyperspace had been rough, pushing the ship and crew to their limits, but the breathtaking cosmic vistas and the thrill of interstellar travel made the danger worthwhile.  The fate of a nascent colony, and the future of humanity, rested on his shoulders, a burden carried with a steely resolve that only the vastness of space could inspire.
