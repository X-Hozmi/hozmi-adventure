
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of London before I set off, a pouch of shillings jingling against my thigh.  My quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  The journey would take me through war-torn France, across the treacherous Alps, and into the sun-baked deserts of the East, each step a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unforgiving elements.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, a new encounter with people as diverse and fascinating as the landscape itself.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The crew, a polyglot of humans and Xylar, navigated asteroid fields and navigated treacherous wormholes, the vastness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  While the dangers were different – plasma storms, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors – the thrill of exploration, the anticipation of discovering the unknown, remained a constant throughout both journeys.
