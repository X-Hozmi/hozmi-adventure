
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the King's Road.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the glint of Eldoria’s rumored gold, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Wanderer'.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but the real adventure was yet to begin. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and establish communication.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted space, Eva and her crew relied on their courage, advanced technology, and the unwavering hope of finding a new home for humanity amidst the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
