
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and deadly peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself all posed constant threats on her arduous journey.  The promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, however, fueled her unwavering spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the gargantuan engine of the 'Stardust Drifter' humming a low, reassuring thrum.  His mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet on the far side of the galaxy, a world rumored to hold the key to humanity's survival.  The vast, inky blackness outside was punctuated only by the distant glow of stars and the occasional flash of a meteor.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Jax faced a different kind of peril – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the threat of pirate raiders, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, both benevolent and hostile.  The weight of humanity rested on his shoulders as he steered the ship through the uncharted cosmic seas.
