
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his ribs, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse. His quest: to reach the distant Holy City of Compostela, a pilgrimage fraught with peril but promised salvation.  He carried with him a worn map, a blessed crucifix, and the unwavering hope that his journey would end in redemption.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms tested her skills and courage.  Her cargo: precious scientific equipment and the unwavering hope that humanity's future lay among the stars.
