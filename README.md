
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his squire a shadow at his side.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Every mile brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and rogue space pirates.  Instead of starvation, the threat was system failure and oxygen depletion.  But unlike the medieval traveler, Elara possessed technology capable of bending space and time, allowing her to traverse unimaginable distances, though the risks and challenges remained a constant companion across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
