
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He’d traded his meager inheritance for a place on this caravan bound for Constantinople, a city whispered to shimmer with unimaginable wealth and danger.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the nearby woods, fueled the thrill of the unknown – bandits, disease, and the endless, unforgiving expanse of the European landscape were all part of the gamble, a price gladly paid for the chance at a life beyond his village.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions beyond known space, a journey spanning light-years and countless alien worlds.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vast, echoing silence of the cosmos.  Each new planet offered a unique tapestry of wonders and peril – uncharted ecosystems teeming with bizarre life, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of the void itself.  For Eva, the true adventure lay not just in reaching these distant shores, but in facing the limitless possibilities of the universe.
