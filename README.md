
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering tapestry of pack animals and weathered wagons, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the restless energy within our hearts.  We're bound for Constantinople, a city shimmering in legend, seeking fortune and escape from the encroaching shadow of the Black Death.  Each day brings new challenges – bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, the gnawing fear of disease – but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the familiar, keeps us moving forward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void, leaving behind the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way for the uncharted territories beyond.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where nebulae paint ethereal canvases and alien worlds beckon with both promise and peril.  We seek new life, new civilizations, new knowledge –  the ultimate adventure, spanning not just continents, but galaxies.
