
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King, a desperate plea for reinforcements.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine – the wild lands held dangers far more real than any battlefield.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were her constant companions on this perilous journey across the ravaged countryside.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her cockpit.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research vessel orbiting a newly discovered planet.  The risks were different now – hostile alien lifeforms, malfunctioning AI, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies. But the thrill of exploration, the yearning to chart the unknown, burned as fiercely in her heart as it had in Elara's.
