
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle was a reminder of the perilous journey ahead – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Yet, the lure of the legendary lost city of El Dorado, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, fueled her onward.  The promise of untold riches and ancient secrets outweighed the gnawing fear, driving her across the unforgiving landscape, a lone figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the deafening silence of interstellar space.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere, a megastructure capable of harnessing the energy of an entire star, a prize coveted by empires across the known galaxies.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of unknown celestial phenomena, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of spatial distortion. But the potential reward, the chance to rewrite galactic history, ignited a fire within her that burned brighter than any star.
