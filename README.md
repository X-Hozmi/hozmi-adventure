
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the relentless terrain tested her endurance daily. Yet, the allure of the unknown fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and potential discoveries. The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and grime, was her only guide through this vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding rogue asteroids was a daily routine, each hyperspace jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the cosmos after a catastrophic event. The vast expanse of space, teeming with wonders and dangers in equal measure, held both the promise of reunion and the chilling possibility of oblivion.  The faint signal emanating from the Xylosian distress beacon was all that guided her through the endless night of stars.
