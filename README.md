
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every step.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering glint of faith and adventure in his eyes spurred him onward, a lone knight against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a journey across lightyears that tested the limits of both her ship and her courage.  The dangers were different—alien predators, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of system failure—but the thrill of exploration, the intoxicating allure of the unknown, burned just as brightly within her as it did in the heart of the medieval knight.
