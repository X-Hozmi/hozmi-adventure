
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onwards. The sun beat down on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, his small band of men a mere shadow against the vastness of the plains.  Their quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each rocky outcrop, each whispering forest, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.  Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies were daily anxieties, yet the unwavering hope of Eldoria fueled their journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also a constant source of unease.  Unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien species made each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover new worlds and expand humanity's reach, outweighed the inherent risks, driving Eva and her crew across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
