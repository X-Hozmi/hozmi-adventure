
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – a desperate cargo for a starving village far to the east.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Her journey was fraught with peril, a testament to the hardships and unwavering spirit required for even the simplest of cross-country travels in the medieval age.  Yet, the promise of sustenance spurred her onward, a beacon brighter than any star.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter* shuddering as they jumped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a newly discovered planet, a jewel shimmering across light-years of inky blackness.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of medieval travel, the journey held its own unique terrors: volatile nebulae, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, was a cold, unforgiving mistress.  The success of his mission hinged on the precision of his navigation and the strength of his crew.
