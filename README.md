
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather map, patched and stained with the sweat of countless journeys, guided her towards the legendary Sunken City, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the thrill of discovery spurred her onward, a fire burning brighter than any hearth.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, its navigation systems charting a course towards Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space, a tapestry woven with shimmering gas clouds and distant galaxies, held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present danger of pirate attacks tested the crew's mettle, but the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets fueled their relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
