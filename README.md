
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air. Her journey to Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow. Yet, with each creak of her saddle and rise of the sun, the thrill of discovery outweighed the fear.  She carried a map older than herself, a promise of silks, spices, and untold stories in the fabled city awaiting her.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage fraught with unimaginable risks – unmapped wormholes, rogue asteroids the size of moons, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space stretched before her, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonder and terrifying unknowns, but the lure of the unknown spurred her on.  The galaxy beckoned.
