
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous, overgrown track.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats and a chipped map, promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dense forest, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and mortal danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey across the unforgiving landscapes of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, charted unmapped nebulae and navigated treacherous asteroid fields, their destination a whispered legend among the cosmos – Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The thrill of discovery mingled with the chilling reality of cosmic hazards: rogue black holes, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations. The journey promised untold scientific advancement, but the risks were equally immense.
