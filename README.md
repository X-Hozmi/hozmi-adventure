
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds.  The promise of Eldoria, however faint, fueled their relentless march across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns were everyday occurrences.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, was a constant companion. Yet, the thought of those waiting on Kepler-186f, their lives dependent on her safe arrival, spurred her onward, a modern-day adventurer navigating a cosmos far stranger and more perilous than any medieval kingdom.
