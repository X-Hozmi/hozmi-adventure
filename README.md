
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks mirroring the anxieties churning in her stomach.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the constant threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura's wonders fueled her onward, a beacon against the harsh realities of the medieval world.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of adventure, of discovery, burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery.  Navigating hyperspace, dodging asteroid fields and the occasional pirate vessel, was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles back on Earth.  But the allure of the unknown, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries, propelled her forward.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders and the silent promise of untold adventures across the galaxy.
