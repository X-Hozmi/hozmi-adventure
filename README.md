
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as he guides his weary steed across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation, fueled by whispered legends and ancient maps, pushes him onward, a lone knight against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f,  a planet rumored to possess a rare energy source vital to the galactic federation's survival.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the loneliness of interstellar travel test her skills and resolve. The vastness of space is a different kind of wilderness, but the human desire for discovery and survival – a timeless thread – remains the same.
