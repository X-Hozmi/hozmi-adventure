
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Black Forest was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry she'd heard as a child. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of fear through her, yet the promise of reaching her sister in the distant kingdom spurred her on. The scent of pine and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear, a constant reminder of the risks inherent in her solitary quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting constant against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the thrill of exploration, the unwavering determination to reach her destination, echoed the spirit of those medieval travelers who braved the earthly wilderness centuries before.
