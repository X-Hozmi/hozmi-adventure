
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Castile, a worn map clutched in her sweaty hand.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery hidden amidst the peaks of the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unpredictable whims of nature itself.  Survival depended on her wit, her courage, and the kindness of strangers encountered along the perilous path.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the unexplored Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of space pirates kept every journey fraught with danger.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology that could save her dying planet.  The vast emptiness of space was a lonely adversary, but the promise of discovery and the camaraderie of her crew fueled her unwavering determination.
