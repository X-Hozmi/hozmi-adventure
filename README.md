
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her face.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness of the Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Her worn map, a precious heirloom, promised a hidden monastery holding the key to her family's lost legacy – a journey fraught with peril, but one she would undertake for the sake of her kin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held a fresh dose of suspense, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulas and distant galaxies, but also a treacherous void riddled with asteroid fields and unknown cosmic phenomena.  The hum of the hyperdrive engines was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the silence of space and the vastness of the unknown, each jump a leap of faith into the infinite possibilities – and perils – of interstellar travel.
