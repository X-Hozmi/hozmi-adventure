
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest – to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother – had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across scorching deserts, and over treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous terrain to bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, but the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, yet the mission – to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy – held far greater urgency.  Navigation through unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a gamble, but the thought of the colonists, stranded and alone, spurred her crew to push their vessel to its limits.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held constant reminders of their isolation and the immense risk they undertook.
