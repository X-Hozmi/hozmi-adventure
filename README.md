
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on her and her meager pack.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, blizzards threatened to bury her alive, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as formidable as any man.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing village, spurred her onward, each step a testament to her unwavering courage.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius navigated the swirling nebula, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  The jump to Xylos IV, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was risky;  uncharted wormholes and unpredictable gravitational fields threatened to crush his vessel.  But the potential reward – the ability to finally reach the mythical Andromeda Galaxy – outweighed the danger, fueling his insatiable thirst for exploration and the promise of untold discoveries.
