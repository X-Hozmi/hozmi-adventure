
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down on his back, a relentless companion to the gnawing hunger in his belly.  His quest – to find the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland – was a perilous journey across uncharted territories.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring rains. But the hope of salvation spurred him onward, a beacon against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a distant galaxy.  The journey was fraught with dangers unseen and unheard of on Earth;  navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate fleets, and battling the insidious effects of prolonged exposure to hyperspace. Yet, the promise of unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel fueled her unwavering determination, making the vast, star-dusted emptiness feel less like isolation and more like a boundless canvas of opportunity.
