
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the King's missive, a sealed scroll promising riches and glory if he delivered it to the far-off city of Aloria, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise painted a new vista of rolling hills or dark forests, each sunset brought the gnawing fear of night in the unforgiving wilderness. His adventure was a test of endurance, a gamble with fate, and a desperate hope for a better life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a gamble on untested coordinates, but the potential discovery of a new energy source for humanity overshadowed the danger.  Millions of stars blurred past her viewport, each a sun with its own untold stories.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, was a constant reminder of her own insignificant yet crucial role in humanity's relentless expansion across the cosmos.
