
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate gamble to reach the rumored fertile lands beyond the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, heightened the ever-present tension – bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable wrath of nature were constant companions on her arduous journey.  The glittering promise of a new life spurred her onward, a tiny ember against the vast, encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* across the inky expanse separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  Navigating through asteroid fields and nebulae, the hum of the hyperdrive a comforting counterpoint to the vast, indifferent silence, she carried a crew tasked with a mission of unprecedented scope: the search for a habitable planet for humanity's expanding population.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien life – but the spirit of adventure, the burning desire to explore the unknown, remained the same.
