
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves sent shivers down his spine, not just from the autumn chill but the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the key to a forgotten magic, a magic that might save his kingdom from the encroaching plague.  He carried with him only his sword, a meager supply of dried meat, and the unwavering hope that his journey wouldn't end in a nameless grave.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf between galaxies. The hyperdrive hummed, a deep thrum vibrating through the vessel, as they navigated the treacherous currents of the Andromeda stream.  Their mission, far more ambitious than Sir Reginald's, was to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to contain a source of energy powerful enough to solve the looming galactic energy crisis.  Eva, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebulae outside the viewport, knew the risks were immense – hostile alien encounters, unforeseen cosmic phenomena, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown. But the potential reward was worth the gamble, the fate of billions hanging in the balance.
