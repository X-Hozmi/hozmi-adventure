
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each creak of the saddle, each crunch of gravel underfoot, was a testament to the miles already endured on her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages they passed.  Yet, the allure of the sacred city, the promise of spiritual cleansing and the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward, a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the gargantuan engines of the *Stardust Wanderer* humming a song of interstellar travel.  Ahead, the emerald jewel of Planet Xylos itself beckoned, a promised land of untold riches and alien wonders.  But the void held dangers far beyond the medieval bandits: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships hunting for valuable cargo. The galaxy was vast, unforgiving, yet the pursuit of discovery, and perhaps even survival, propelled the *Stardust Wanderer* ever forward.
