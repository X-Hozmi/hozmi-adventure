The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy ochre curtain obscuring the endless plains of Aquitaine.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril – bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, fueling his thirst for the adventure that lay beyond the next horizon.  The whispered tales of Eldoria's riches were nothing compared to the intoxicating lure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, speckled with distant suns and swirling cosmic dust, held both wonder and dread.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged warp drives, and battling the occasional space pirate were just part of the routine. The true adventure, however, lay in the possibility of discovering life beyond Earth, a scientific marvel and a profound personal journey for a woman driven by insatiable curiosity and the unwavering pursuit of exploration.
