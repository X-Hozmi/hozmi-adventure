His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the lost secrets of a powerful, ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of Ys, and the glory that awaited its discoverer, spurred him relentlessly across the blistered landscape of Europe. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, each sunset a fragile hope for survival and ultimate triumph.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of rare isotopes across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems.

Yet, the vastness of space, and the potential for discovery at every jump, fueled her insatiable thirst for exploration – a modern-day odyssey amongst the stars.
