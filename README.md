
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with supplies and the weight of her family's hopes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of unease, but the promise of a new life in the fertile lands beyond spurred her onward.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were just a few of the perils she faced, yet the thrill of the unknown, the vastness of the uncharted territories, fueled her courageous journey across the rugged heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy to manageable size, but the dangers of interstellar exploration remained.  Uncharted wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure made each jump a gamble.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, unearthing lost civilizations, and expanding the reach of humanity across the cosmos propelled Jax and his crew into the black, boundless expanse of space, their vessel a tiny speck against the awe-inspiring backdrop of the Milky Way.
