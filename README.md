
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown brush, fueled a mixture of fear and fierce determination.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were all threats, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring drone amidst the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Though the risks were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the core of the adventure remained the same: a relentless pursuit of something precious, a journey fuelled by hope against the odds.
