
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming dully under the overcast sky, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the unending war ravaging his kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of legend, the hope of peace, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess knowledge of faster-than-light travel.  Warp jumps between star systems were risky, fraught with dangers from rogue asteroids to hostile alien encounters. But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting with humanity's forgotten brethren, spurred Elara and her crew onward, each jump a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
