
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary horse onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Provence, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the slow, creeping death he was desperately trying to outrun.  His journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, desperation, and the unpredictable brutality of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth, a struggle for resources that had fueled this perilous interstellar expedition.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the backdrop of infinite possibility.
