
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits a chilling whisper on the wind. Each sunrise reveals a new challenge – a broken wagon wheel to repair, a dwindling water supply to ration, or the unnerving sight of vultures circling in the distance.  Yet, the promise of Constantinople, a city shimmering with untold riches and opportunities, fuels our weary steps forward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship powered by a harnessed singularity, leaps across the void between galaxies.  We are explorers, charting unmapped nebulae and encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  The thrill of discovery intertwines with the constant vigilance needed to navigate asteroid fields, evade space pirates, and repair the ship’s failing hyperdrive.  Each jump into hyperspace is a gamble, a plunge into the unknown where the breathtaking beauty of cosmic wonders could be instantly shattered by the unforgiving reality of space.
