
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising untold riches in the mythical city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land were a constant companion. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends of Eldoria's magic, propelled her onward, a lone figure against the vast expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting lullaby against the terrifying beauty of the cosmos, nebulae swirling like cosmic brushstrokes across the viewport. Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos cluster, a region teeming with unexplored planets and potentially, new forms of life – and untold dangers. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a constant reminder of their isolation, a test of courage and resilience against the infinite unknowns of the galaxy.
