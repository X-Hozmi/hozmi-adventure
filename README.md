
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the relentless exhaustion of the road, and the ever-present fear of disease.  Yet, with every conquered peak and every shared hardship, their bond grew stronger, forged in the crucible of their shared adventure.  The legends of the holy city, and the whispered tales of the miracles within, fueled their weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The journey was fraught with peril – unstable wormholes threatened to tear their ship apart, alien lifeforms lurked in the void, and the vast distances themselves tested the limits of human endurance. But the promise of discovery, the potential to find new homes for humanity amongst the stars, spurred Eva and her crew onward, their courage fueled by the infinite wonder of the cosmos.
