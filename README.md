
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights urged their weary steeds onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a testament to human resilience in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant K'tharr Hegemony, a journey fraught with the perils of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing critical systems under the watchful gaze of alien predators tested the crew's skill and courage.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, but the potential rewards of interstellar commerce were a worthy incentive for their perilous voyage.
