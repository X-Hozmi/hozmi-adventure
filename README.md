
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whisper of legend, the promise of untold riches and knowledge, fueled his weary bones, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp drives hummed, stars streaked across the viewport like cosmic brushstrokes, and the silence of space was punctuated only by the ship's soft thrum and the crackle of comms.  The vastness of the galaxy, both terrifying and exhilarating, stretched before her, a testament to human ambition and the enduring allure of the undiscovered.
