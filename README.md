
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, a ribbon of mud and dust snaking through the Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the incessant rain. His quest – to recover the stolen relic of Saint Amand – led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed company of suspicious merchants and even more suspicious brigands. Each day brought a new peril, testing not only his courage but his dwindling supplies and the loyalty of his small band of companions.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the abandoned research outpost on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with challenges – unpredictable spatial anomalies, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the ever-present hum of the ship's failing hyperdrive.  But the promise of scientific discovery, and the weight of her crew's lives in her hands, spurred her onwards through the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
