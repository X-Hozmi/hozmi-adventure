The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest – to deliver the King's ransom to the besieged city of Carcassonne –  was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and whispers of monstrous beasts roamed the deeper woods.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, yet the glint of the gold nestled in his saddlebags spurred him onward, a beacon of hope against the looming darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of distant suns, was both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly lonely.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded constant vigilance.  But the lure of discovery, the possibility of finding humanity's forgotten brethren, was a powerful incentive, a driving force stronger than the cold vacuum of space itself.
