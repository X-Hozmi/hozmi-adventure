
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised autumn sky, spurred his destrier onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering pines, leading him deeper into the untamed Ardennes forest. His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a mission fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous bogs threatening to swallow man and beast, and the ever-present chill of a looming winter. Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled his determination, promising a reward greater than gold: the glory of a successful knight errant.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, a test of both ship and crew, involved navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outmaneuvering pirate vessels from the Andromeda galaxy, and enduring weeks of monotonous hyperspace travel.  The promise of discovery, however, fueled her crew's tireless efforts, a quest not for gold or glory, but for the very future of humankind – a new home among the stars.
