
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the scrub, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the desperate hope it offered, spurred her on, through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-scorched plains, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  But the galaxy was a perilous place.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadows between stars, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps meant facing uncharted cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of navigational failure.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers, relied on their skills and camaraderie to navigate the vast distances and dangers of the cosmos, their journey a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery.
