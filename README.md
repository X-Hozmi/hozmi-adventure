
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold forgotten magic and untold riches.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the chance to escape the drudgery of his village life, spurred him onwards, each sunrise bringing a renewed sense of hope, mixed with the ever-present reality of the dangers that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across light-years of unpredictable space.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, alien scavengers lurked in the dark sectors, and the ever-present loneliness of deep space tested her resolve. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovery, fuelled her tireless pursuit of the unknown.
