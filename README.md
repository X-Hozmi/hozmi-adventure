
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a testament to countless creases and water stains, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Brigid.  Each creak of her pack mule, each rustle in the tall grass, brought a prickle of both excitement and fear. Bandits, starvation, and the sheer vastness of the land itself were her constant companions on this perilous journey, yet the lure of the unknown pushed her onward.  The sun beat down relentlessly, but the thought of discovery fueled her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Valerius piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting a course to previously unimaginable worlds, outweighed any risk. The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the silent immensity of the cosmos, and Rexx gripped his controls, ready to face whatever wonders – or terrors – awaited them.
