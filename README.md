
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  The whispered rumors of a hidden monastery, said to hold ancient healing texts, spurred her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the unwavering belief in her quest fueled her weary legs. The vast, unpredictable landscape itself was an adventure, a test of endurance and will against a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a jewel hidden amongst swirling cosmic dust and the gravitational pull of a dying star.  The journey across galaxies was a constant dance with celestial hazards – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to chart new territories and expand human understanding, far outweighed the risks for this intrepid explorer.
