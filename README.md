
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she spurred her mare across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the gnawing hunger in her belly, but also the thrill of the unknown.  Her quest – to deliver a sacred relic to the distant monastery – was a perilous journey through feuding kingdoms and treacherous forests, a test of her courage and resilience.  The whispered tales of dragons and mythical beasts, once dismissed as folklore, now seemed plausible in the shadow of towering mountains and whispering woods.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the dangers of space were no less real than Elara's medieval perils.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear his ship apart, and the vast emptiness between stars held silent, unseen terrors, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble with fate.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of the uncharted cosmos, fueled his relentless journey.
