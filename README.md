
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke clinging to the wind.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to be hidden beyond the treacherous Black Mire.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of Ys, a city of gold and magic, fueled her onward, a shimmering beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the burgeoning colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, solar flares that threatened to fry her ship's systems, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms. But the promise of a new dawn for humanity, a future among the stars, propelled her through the unforgiving vastness of space.
