
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire, the distant Alps a shimmering mirage. His quest: to recover the lost relic of St. Jude, rumored to lie hidden within a forgotten monastery nestled in the treacherous Carpathian Mountains.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey, a tapestry woven with peril and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula aboard the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere orbiting a rogue planet, a feat demanding not only mastery of interstellar navigation but also the fortitude to brave uncharted regions teeming with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and potentially hostile alien life.  The vast, star-strewn canvas of the cosmos stretched before her, a thrilling and terrifying expanse beckoning her toward the furthest reaches of known space.
