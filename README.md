
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack mules and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our relentless westward trek towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the ever-present gnawing of hunger, and the fear of the unknown – a landscape vast and unforgiving, where whispered legends of monstrous creatures and treacherous terrain are as real as the scorching sun beating down on our backs.  The promise of riches and glory, however, keeps our spirits (barely) afloat.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel of shimmering chrome and advanced alloys, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with its own perils – cosmic storms that threaten to tear our ship apart, uncharted nebulae concealing unimaginable dangers, and the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive a reminder of the immense power, and the equally immense risk, of our interstellar voyage. The universe stretches before us, a tapestry of wonder and terror, promising both unimaginable discovery and potential annihilation.
