
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she squinted at the sun-baked horizon.  Her worn leather boots had carried her across half of Europe, a journey dictated by whispers of a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scripture of Saint Brigid.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit ambushes, starvation, or the chilling reality of the Black Death's shadow stretching across the land.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of sacred knowledge, spurred her onward, her heart a drumbeat against the relentless rhythm of the road.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids, she piloted her vessel through the breathtaking cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet, a shimmering oasis of life in the vast, desolate expanse of space. The risks were astronomical—fatal radiation storms, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities—but the potential reward, a new home for humanity, fueled her intrepid spirit and drove her across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
