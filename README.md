
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Provence, a worn map clutched in her gloved hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Eldoria, and the unwavering hope for her brother's survival, spurred her onward, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones she passed.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate ships were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space, breathtaking yet terrifying, filled her with both awe and a profound sense of loneliness.  But the knowledge that her cargo could mean the difference between life and death for colonists on a new world fueled her resolve, propelling her deeper into the inky blackness.
