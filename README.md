
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen by spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, promising riches and exotic spices beyond the horizon, pushes us onward.  The nights are filled with campfire tales of fantastical beasts and legendary cities, a stark contrast to the harsh realities of our daily struggle for survival.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship bristling with advanced technology, jumps between galaxies, each warp jump a gamble against unforeseen spatial anomalies.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets and potential allies.  The vast emptiness of space is a constant companion, broken only by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies. The thrill of discovery, the risk of encountering unknown alien civilizations, and the sheer scale of the cosmos fuel our unrelenting journey across the unimaginable distances of the universe.
