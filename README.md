
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onwards.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy ochre curtain obscuring the already distant spires of Oakhaven. Ahead lay the untamed wilds of the Black Forest, rumored to be infested with brigands and worse.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the Duke of Bavaria, was a perilous one, fraught with the dangers of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of apprehension, each sunset a renewed vow to reach his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling pinpricks of distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. Hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, and the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant reminder of the fragility of their vessel against the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  The journey, a pilgrimage of hope and ambition, demanded unwavering courage and precise navigation, a gamble against the infinite.
