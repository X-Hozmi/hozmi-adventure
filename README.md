
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – a constant reminder of the peril and uncertainty that defined travel in this era, a gamble played with life itself for a sliver of hope.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but Elara's heart pounded not with fear, but with the thrill of exploration – the intoxicating freedom of traversing the galaxy, facing the mysteries and wonders of the cosmos.
