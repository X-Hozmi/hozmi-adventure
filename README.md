
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague.  Each day brought new perils: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unpredictable river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The allure of Ys, however, fueled their relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Rex steered the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging hostile pirate ships were commonplace occurrences on this interstellar voyage. The mission, a desperate search for a new home for humanity, pushed Elara and her crew to the limits of their endurance and technology.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and deadly dangers, making their galactic journey a perilous, but ultimately hopeful, adventure.
