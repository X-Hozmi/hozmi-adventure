
The year is 1278.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of his sister's recovery fueled his resolve, propelling him further into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to solving a galactic famine.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and facing the existential dread of the vast emptiness between stars, Eva and her crew pressed on, bound together by a shared purpose and the indomitable spirit of human exploration.
