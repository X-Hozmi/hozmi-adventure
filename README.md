
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the even more fearsome unknown.  He carried only a worn map, a pouch of dwindling coins, and a heart full of reckless hope, spurred on by whispered tales of adventure and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a dimensional rift decades prior.  Navigation was treacherous, relying on antiquated star charts and the unreliable whispers of the galactic ether.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to reunite a lost civilization, fueled her unwavering determination, even in the face of unimaginable distances and cosmic perils.
