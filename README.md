
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear prickling his nostrils.  He was bound for the distant city of Prague, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unpredictable weather could prove as deadly as any blade.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: treacherous mountain passes, fordings of icy rivers, and the constant gnawing anxiety of the unknown.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the king, felt more monumental with every league covered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The ship's AI, a soothing female voice, reported on the jump coordinates while the vast tapestry of stars shimmered outside the viewport.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and galaxies.  While the dangers were less visceral than Thomas’s – more technological malfunctions and hostile alien encounters than brigands – the scale of the voyage was breathtakingly vast.  Every hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted depths of space.  The weight of the colony's fate rested on her shoulders, a pressure far heavier than any wind or weather.
