
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she rode, the relentless sun beating down on the endless plains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a vengeful lord.  Each creak of her aging mare's joints was a reminder of the perilous journey ahead – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large.

Their jump to Xylos had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints, but the reward promised untold riches – a rare crystalline mineral essential for faster-than-light travel.  The galaxy held countless such treasures and perils, nebulae shimmering like cosmic masterpieces and rogue asteroids threatening to become deadly projectiles.  The vast expanse of space was a daunting, beautiful, and infinitely dangerous frontier, where fortune favored the bold and quick-witted.
