
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the harsh, rocky landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the very air crackled with the unseen dangers of an untamed world. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory, etching the adventure deep into her soul.  The promise of Eldoria, a city said to hold ancient magic and untold riches, fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, she dodged rogue asteroids and navigated nebulae of vibrant, swirling colours.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond those faced by land-bound adventurers of old.  Yet, the potential rewards – a future free from conflict – made every risk worth taking, for Ryla carried the hopes of countless worlds on her shoulders.
