
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a ragged tapestry of humans and beasts, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, each sunset the gnawing hunger of a journey far from home.  We seek the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones, a place said to hold untold riches and unimaginable power.  Our meager supplies dwindle with each passing day, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the unpredictable, spurs us onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  We're charting a course to the Andromeda Galaxy, a pilgrimage to a rumored nexus of ancient technology, a place where the whispers of forgotten empires echo across the void.  The vastness of space is a terrifying beauty, the constant hum of the engines a hypnotic counterpoint to the loneliness of interstellar travel.  Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery, of unlocking the universe's secrets, outweighs the risks a thousandfold.
