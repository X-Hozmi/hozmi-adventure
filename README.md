
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests the hill, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aerthos is far from over; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions.  Yet, the whispered promise of the mythical Sunstone, hidden within a forgotten monastery nestled in the Whispering Peaks, fuels her onward.  Each aching muscle, each sleepless night, is a step closer to a destiny she can barely comprehend.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the besieged colony of Aethel on Kepler-186f.  Hyper-jumps across vast interstellar distances are commonplace, yet the unpredictable nature of space, from rogue asteroids to temporal anomalies, keeps even the most seasoned captain on edge.  The weight of countless lives rests on her shoulders, a far cry from the simple treasures sought by medieval adventurers, but no less perilous a quest.
