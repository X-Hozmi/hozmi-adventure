
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn leather boots crunched on the parched earth.  His small band, weary from weeks traversing the unforgiving landscape, pressed onward.  Rumours of a hidden city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts, spurred them across scorching plains and treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought the promise of danger – bandits, starving wolves, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving elements – but the lure of the unknown pushed them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of nebulae ablaze with colours unseen on Earth.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present danger of space pirates.  The vast, empty expanse of space held both terrifying isolation and thrilling wonder, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
