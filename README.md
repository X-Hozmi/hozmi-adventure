
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked every village.  But the promise of the fabled Emerald City, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, fueled her relentless pursuit, each day a gamble against the unforgiving elements and the ever-present threat of human malice.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a low, resonant song. Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational forces, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, friend or foe, made each jump into hyperspace a breathtaking gamble for life itself.
