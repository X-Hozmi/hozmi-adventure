
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Bandits were a constant threat, the whispers of plague a chilling undercurrent to every sunset.  Her quest – to reach the fabled monastery at the mountain's peak, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness – pushed her onward, past crumbling castles and through whispering forests haunted by the echoes of ancient battles. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where survival often depended on more than just luck.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes that punctuated the galaxy, each jump a gamble with space and time itself.  Unlike the predictable perils of medieval travel, the vastness of space offered both limitless potential and the terrifying unknown, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile existence amongst the cosmic wonders and dangers.
