
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the grey sky, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed with each passing day.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his relentless march across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but navigating the unpredictable currents of hyperspace and evading the territorial claims of hostile alien empires demanded skill and courage.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast unknown, but the enduring hope of reuniting with humanity’s lost kin propelled her onward, a lone star against the infinite blackness.
