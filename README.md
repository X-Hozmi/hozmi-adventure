
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both horse and rider plummeting, and the biting winds carried the ever-present threat of frostbite.  But the whispers of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, each hardship fueling her unwavering determination.  The thrill of the unknown, the tantalizing promise of discovery, made the hardship worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with its own unique dangers – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Elara's physical journey, Eva's traversed the vast expanse of space, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown. Yet, the allure of unmapped star systems, of potentially habitable worlds waiting to be discovered, fuelled her intrepid spirit, mirroring the ancient adventurer's quest for the unknown.
