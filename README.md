
The year is 1347.  Our battered wagon creaks across the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to everything.  Ahead, the Pyrenees loom, their peaks shrouded in mist, a daunting barrier between us and the rumored gold mines of Castile.  Each day brings its own challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, the gnawing hunger in our bellies.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of legendary cities and forgotten magic, keeps us pushing onward, our hearts filled with a heady mix of fear and exhilaration.  We are pilgrims, traders, adventurers – seekers of fortune and glory in a world brimming with both peril and promise.

Centuries later, the Althea leaps across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a hum against the vast silence.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the light of distant quasars, her crew a diverse band united by a common purpose: the search for habitable worlds beyond the known colonies.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted darkness where anomalies and unknown threats lurk.  But the possibility of discovering new life, new civilizations, new resources fuels their relentless journey, their courage tempered by the vastness and mystery of the cosmos.  The adventure is not just in the destination, but in the perilous, awe-inspiring voyage itself.
