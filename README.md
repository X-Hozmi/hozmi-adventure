
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Yet, with each arduous mile, the thrill of the unknown spurred them onward – the allure of distant shrines, the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, and the whispered legends of mythical beasts and enchanted lands, all fueled their tireless steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The dangers were different, but no less formidable.  Uncharted cosmic anomalies threatened to tear her ship apart, hostile alien patrols patrolled the void, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her crew's resolve.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of unmapped star systems, the thrill of discovery, and the promise of encountering new civilizations far outweighed the risks.
