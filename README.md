
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death loomed larger than any map could show, testing her courage and resilience on a journey that stretched far beyond the familiar.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with dangers unseen.  Hyperjumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each voyage a gamble, a high-stakes game of chance and skill played against the backdrop of an infinite universe.
