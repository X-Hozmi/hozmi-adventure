
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease.  Yet, the unwavering glint in her eyes reflects a fierce determination born of desperation and hope, driving her onward towards the fabled monastery rumored to hold the answer.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, stretches ahead, a trial of light-years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faces not only the physical dangers of space but the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present threat of unforeseen anomalies lurking in the vast unknown. Yet, the promise of a new home, a chance at a fresh start, fuels their relentless pursuit of a better tomorrow.
