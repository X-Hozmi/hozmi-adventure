
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the spires of Camelot a distant shimmer in the afternoon sun. His quest, to retrieve the stolen Orb of Aethelred, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across vast, sun-baked plains, and into the shadowy depths of the Whispering Woods. Each day brought new peril – bandits lurking in the shadows, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of adventure in his eyes burned brighter than any hardship, fueled by the promise of glory and the whispered legends surrounding the Orb's power.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, transforming the vast distances between galaxies into a series of jumps and calculated risks.  Each warp jump held the potential for catastrophic failure, yet the thrill of exploration, the hope of finding survivors, and the allure of the unknown pushed her forward, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted cosmic sea.
