
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of northern France, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant, unsettling cries of wolves. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching Black Death. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the hope of reaching his elusive destination, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and isolating.  The risks were different now – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, the unpredictable nature of warp travel – but the thrill of exploration, the yearning to discover the unknown, burned as brightly within her as it had in Sir Reginald centuries before.
