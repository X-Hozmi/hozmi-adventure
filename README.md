
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary beasts, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, whispering forests concealing unseen dangers, and rivers swollen with spring melt threatening to swallow us whole.  The reward?  The legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a shimmering mirage in the harsh reality of our arduous journey.  Every aching muscle and thirst-wracked throat is fueled by the promise of discovery, a testament to the enduring human spirit's desire to explore the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The Althea, our generation ship, hums with the tireless energy of its fusion core as it navigates the Orion Arm.  We're not bound by physical limitations; faster-than-light travel allows us to leap across vast interstellar distances, exploring worlds bathed in the light of alien suns.  Yet, the challenge remains; each planet presents its unique trials – hostile atmospheres, unforeseen alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving void.  But the thrill of discovering new civilizations, charting unmapped galaxies, and pushing the boundaries of human understanding outweighs every risk, echoing the same primal human drive that propelled those medieval caravans centuries ago.
