
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the parched Provençal landscape.  The sun beats down mercilessly, turning the dust to shimmering heat waves.  Ahead lie the treacherous Pyrenees, whispered to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts.  Every creak of the wheels, every rustle in the scrub, holds the promise of danger – or untold riches, hidden in some forgotten monastery or forgotten ruin.  We journey onward, driven by a thirst for the unknown, for glory, and for a chance to escape the suffocating grip of our mundane lives.


Centuries later, the Althea's hyperdrive hums a constant, low thrum as it leaps across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes reflecting the swirling nebula outside, navigates through asteroid fields and uncharted gravitational anomalies. This isn't a journey for gold or glory, but for the survival of the human race,  searching for a new home amidst the glittering, dangerous beauty of deep space. Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unknowable expanse, a testament to the boundless human desire to explore even the furthest reaches of existence.
