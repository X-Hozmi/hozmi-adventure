
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by both beast and brigand.  My meager supplies were dwindling, but the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, with its rumored healing springs and untold riches, spurred me on. Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay in wait on this arduous journey across the land.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, star-dusted emptiness.  My destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting Kepler-186f, a world teeming with exotic lifeforms and rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey had already spanned decades, punctuated by near-misses with asteroid fields and the chilling silence of hyperspace. Yet, the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and venturing into the unknown, fueled my determination to reach Xylos and unravel the mysteries that awaited me among the stars.
