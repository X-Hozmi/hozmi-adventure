
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of a monstrous beast that stalked the highlands fueled her fear. Yet, the allure of Eldoria, with its promised riches and ancient knowledge, spurred her onward, each creak of the saddle a testament to her unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanite crystals across three galaxies, a task made even more treacherous by the looming threat of the Kryll raiders, notorious for their lightning-fast starfighters and ruthless efficiency.  The vast expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers, a testament to the boundless challenges and rewards of interstellar trade in the far future.
