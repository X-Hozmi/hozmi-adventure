
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the distant peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains jagged against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a king's desperate plea for a legendary healer said to reside in the far-off city of Porthaven.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are mere inconveniences compared to her mission; each league a gamble, each sunrise a victory against the unforgiving wilderness.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of saving a life fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* cuts a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of colossal black holes, she pushes her crew and vessel to their limits.  The vastness of space offers a different kind of peril than Elara faced; the loneliness of infinite darkness, the unpredictable nature of alien entities, and the constant risk of equipment failure.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery, drives them towards the furthest reaches of explored space.
