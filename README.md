
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies – it contains the hopes of her family, fleeing the encroaching plague and seeking a rumored sanctuary across the mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the scrub, brings the threat of bandits or starvation closer, yet the fierce glint in her eye speaks of a determination that burns brighter than the midday sun.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the promise of a new life fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous political landscape of intergalactic trade routes, Ryla confronts not only cosmic hazards but also the subtle dangers of corporate greed and alien conspiracies.  The vastness of space offers unparalleled beauty, but it’s a beauty that hides countless threats, testing the courage and ingenuity of Ryla and her crew in their relentless pursuit of the unknown.
