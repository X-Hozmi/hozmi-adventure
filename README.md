
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crested the hill.  Before them lay the vast, untamed expanse of the Ardennes forest, a tapestry of emerald and shadow whispering tales of bandits and mythical beasts.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, carrying a sacred relic vital to her besieged village.  Each creak of Barnaby's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the perilous thrill of her journey, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay ahead, and the immense courage required to overcome them.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unexplored systems was routine, yet the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos never ceased to inspire awe. The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and distant suns, was both a mesmerizing spectacle and a constant reminder of the fragility of life, and the incredible distances humanity was now traversing to secure its future amongst the stars.
