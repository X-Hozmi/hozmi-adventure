
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held a King's ransom in spices, a desperately needed trade against the encroaching famine.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandits or worse – the wild, untamed lands were as dangerous as the seas.  The journey to the bustling port city of Marseilles was fraught with peril, a gamble against starvation, but the potential reward ignited a fire in her belly, sharper than any sword.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  While the dangers weren't bandits and starvation, they were no less formidable – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar travel, felt a familiar thrill course through her veins.  The vastness of space, like the medieval plains, offered both immense danger and the tantalizing allure of discovery.
