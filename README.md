
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cart piled high with salted cod and the hopes of a meager fortune.  Across the churning English Channel, through the sun-baked vineyards of France, and into the shadowy forests of the Holy Roman Empire we trekked, dodging bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for food and shelter in strange and bustling towns. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, a constant reminder of the risks and rewards inherent in medieval overland travel.  The whispered tales of dragons and mythical beasts only heightened the sense of adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky black between galaxies, the distant nebulae painting a breathtaking canvas beyond the viewport.  Navigating wormholes and asteroid fields is a daily challenge, the thrill of discovery tempered by the ever-present danger of cosmic radiation and unpredictable gravitational forces.  Each jump takes us to a new planet, a new alien civilization – vibrant, hostile, or simply indifferent to our presence.  The search for new worlds, for new knowledge, fuels our journey, making the risks of interstellar travel a small price to pay for the breathtaking wonders we encounter.
