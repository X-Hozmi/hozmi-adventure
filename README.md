
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a meticulously drawn map promising a legendary lost city nestled in the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – yet the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a stark contrast to the drudgery of village life she'd left behind.  She dreamt not of riches, but of uncovering forgotten secrets, a quest as vast as the land itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, mapping potential habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colours and unimaginable distances, held both wonder and peril.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery, of finding a new home among the stars, fueled her crew's unwavering courage.
