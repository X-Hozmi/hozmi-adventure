The dust-choked road stretched before them, an endless ribbon unwinding through the unforgiving landscape.  For weeks, they had traversed kingdoms and bandit-infested forests, their quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria fueled by whispers of ancient magic and untold riches. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swift rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of raiders lurking in the shadows.  The journey was arduous, but the allure of adventure burned brighter than any hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, though vastly faster than any medieval trek, held its own perils.  Warp drive malfunctions, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks kept her crew on edge.  Yet, the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped star systems, and expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy made the risks worthwhile. The vastness of space, a terrifying and exhilarating frontier, was their medieval equivalent of a world map brimming with unknown lands.
