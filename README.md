
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, had already claimed two pack mules and tested her resolve to the breaking point.  Bandits, storms, and the sheer unforgiving landscape were all foes in this brutal adventure, but the glint of gold in her imagination fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of another step closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and energy.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant.  The galaxy held infinite possibilities, but also infinite dangers; pirate patrols, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown space anomalies made each jump between star systems a gamble.  But for Razor, the thrill of the unknown, the endless expanse of space, and the chance to prove his worth were irresistible calls to adventure.
