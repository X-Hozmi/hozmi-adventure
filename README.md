
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape, a testament to human ambition and the enduring allure of the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp drives hummed, and alien constellations blazed past viewport windows, a stark contrast to Thomas's earthly struggles.  Yet, the same spirit of exploration burned within her – the relentless pursuit of knowledge and the intoxicating pull of the undiscovered, a human drive that transcends time and space.
