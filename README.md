
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  The journey was perilous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild, and the whispers of monstrous beasts haunted the nights.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in desolate villages, and constantly battling the gnawing fear that Eldoria might be nothing more than a legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden, inexplicable energy surge.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between stars, but the cosmos held its own dangers.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  The fate of a colony, and perhaps even the understanding of intergalactic travel itself, rested on Eva's courage and her ship's aging hyperdrive.
