
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom – not in gold, but in seeds of a rare spice rumored to cure the Black Death.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, yet the burning hope for salvation fueled her perilous journey eastward, a quest that felt as vast and unforgiving as the endless horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with sentient flora and hostile insectoid life.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms, pirate raiders, and the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems made every jump a gamble, a constant test of skill and courage in the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
