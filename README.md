
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scrolls of Hermes.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the obstacles strewn across his path.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, yet the lure of the unknown, the whisper of ancient secrets, spurred him relentlessly towards his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source discovered on a newly-charted planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and combating the unpredictable effects of hyperspace travel were everyday occurrences.  The vastness of the cosmos, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, presented a challenge unlike any faced by Thomas, yet the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovery, ignited a similar fire in Eva's soul.
