
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map, promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Eloise.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on her perilous journey; each sunrise brought fresh challenges and a renewed hope for the sanctuary she sought.  The medieval world was vast and unforgiving, but the lure of the unknown fuelled her relentless westward trek.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing warp core breaches were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyage.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims before her, Eva’s journey was propelled by advanced technology, but the courage and resilience required to confront the unknown remained a timeless human necessity.  The vast expanse of space offered a different kind of hardship, but the spirit of adventure, the thirst for discovery, remained unchanged.
