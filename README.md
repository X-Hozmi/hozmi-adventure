
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the parched landscape, the only sounds the rhythmic clop of hooves and the occasional hawk's cry overhead.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura and claim the lost artifact of the Sun God, felt less heroic and more like a desperate struggle against the elements and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of the desolate plains. Each mile was a victory, each sunrise a renewed pledge to continue his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a breathtaking spectacle from her viewport, belied the treacherous currents of cosmic radiation that threatened to fry her ship's systems.  Her mission, to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, felt less like exploration and more like a high-stakes delivery run across an infinite, unforgiving ocean of stars. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held her captive in its awe-inspiring grasp, but the lives of the colonists spurred her onwards.
