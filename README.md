
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned – a few meager coins, dried herbs, and a chipped map promising a legendary lost city said to hold unimaginable riches.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at the dangers lurking unseen: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of adventure, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its sensors scanning for habitable planets in the Andromeda galaxy.  Years of interstellar travel had etched lines on her face, mirroring the vastness of space itself.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for disaster – rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, or the chilling emptiness of the void. But the promise of discovering new life, exploring uncharted worlds, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge fueled her unwavering determination, making every risk worthwhile.
