
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged city of Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient olive groves, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air, a more insidious threat than any highwayman.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, was a potential harbinger of peril, heightening the thrill of her desperate journey.  Survival itself was an adventure, a daily test of courage and resilience against the brutal beauty of a medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll raiders, a formidable alien race, was a constant gamble.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, each nebula a breathtaking spectacle, each unknown system a potential graveyard.   Her adventure wasn't simply about reaching Xylos, but about pushing the boundaries of human exploration and enduring the cosmic unknowns that stretched between the stars.
