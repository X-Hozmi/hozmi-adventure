Ahead, the road wound its way through a dense, ancient forest, a tapestry of emerald green and deep shadow. Every creak of the wooden wheels, every rustle of leaves, whispered tales of adventure. For Tristan, a young squire yearning for glory, this journey held the promise of knighthood, of valor tested against fearsome beasts and cunning foes.

Her home planet, a vibrant world teeming with life, was shrinking in the viewport, a testament to the immensity of the universe.

The journey was perilous, fraught with unknown dangers, but the allure of the unknown ignited a fire within her soul.
