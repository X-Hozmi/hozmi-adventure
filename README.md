
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – or peril. Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant threats, but the lure of the unknown pushed her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns, held both wonder and dread.  Navigation glitches, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events were just a few of the hazards she faced. Yet, the possibility of discovering a new world, a new beginning, fueled her relentless journey across the galaxy.
