
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery nestled high in the Carpathian Mountains, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the rough terrain tested her endurance, and whispered tales of mythical beasts lurking in the shadowed forests kept her ever vigilant.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a fragile victory in her arduous trek across the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a distant galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate vessels, and dealing with unpredictable warp storms were all part of a day's work. The vast, uncharted cosmos held wonders beyond imagination, but also dangers that dwarfed anything her medieval predecessors could have conceived. The universe was a perilous playground, and Eva, a seasoned explorer, was ready to play.
