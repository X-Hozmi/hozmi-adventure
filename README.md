
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unmarked trails, bartering for food and shelter in unfamiliar villages, and weathering sudden storms that threatened to consume them entirely.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve grew stronger, fueled by faith and the promise of reaching their sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a distant galaxy.  The journey was a tapestry of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen supplies tested her skills and courage to their limits.  But the allure of discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories amongst the stars, outweighed the risks – a testament to humanity’s insatiable thirst for exploration across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
