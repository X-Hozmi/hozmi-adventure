
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with every creaking step of her faithful beast, a sense of thrilling freedom bloomed in her chest; the open road, though perilous, promised adventure far grander than any tale spun in the village tavern.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, was a constant companion.  But the unknown held dangers more insidious than bandits or disease— rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling possibility of encountering alien civilizations with hostile intentions. Still, the boundless expanse of the cosmos beckoned, promising discoveries that would rewrite the very history of humankind.
