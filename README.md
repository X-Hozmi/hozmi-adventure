
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of her resilience. Yet, with every hardship overcome, her spirit soared, fueled by the unwavering hope of reaching her sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding civilization.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and unforeseen dangers, dwarfed even the most ambitious medieval treks.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and encounters with alien species – these were the trials of her age, demanding courage, precision, and a pioneering spirit as bold as Elara's.
