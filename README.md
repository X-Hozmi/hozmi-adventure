
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to Constantinople felt endless, a tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, the sting of hunger, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers to ford, and the wary suspicion of villagers clinging to their isolated lives. Yet, the lure of the fabled silks of the East, whispered tales of exotic spices and the promise of a fortune, spurred him onward.  The road was his battlefield, and survival his greatest conquest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, hurtling through the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport, breathtaking in their cosmic grandeur, paled in comparison to the thrill of the unknown.  Her mission: to chart unmapped star systems, searching for habitable planets and new resources for a humanity reaching for the stars.  The dangers weren't bandits and disease, but rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling vastness of space itself.  Her journey was a race against time, a gamble against the unforgiving indifference of the cosmos.
