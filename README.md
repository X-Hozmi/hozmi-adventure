
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sharpened her senses.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, one arduous step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Nird, a perilous undertaking requiring navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and outsmarting the treacherous Nird natives.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and untold dangers, presented a different kind of challenge than Elara's medieval trek, yet the thrill of the unknown, the relentless pursuit of a vital goal, connected them across the chasm of time.
