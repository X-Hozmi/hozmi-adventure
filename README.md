
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's destrier as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her lost brother, rumored to have joined a mercenary band heading east.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the brutal chill of an unexpected winter storm. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered tales of distant cities and exotic cultures, fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the backdrop of a medieval world ripe with peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of the bridge.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of the galaxy, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges that dwarfed even the most formidable medieval trials, demanding both courage and unwavering technological skill from Eva and her crew.
