
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering faintly in the distance.  Her journey from Prague has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the promise of the papal court, and perhaps a chance to escape her arranged marriage, fuels her onward.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape, a new opportunity to test her resilience and cunning in a world brimming with both beauty and brutality.  The road stretches before her, a tapestry woven with danger and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Ahead lie treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of unlocking galactic secrets, and the potential to reshape the future of interstellar travel, outweighs the risk.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and wondrous expanse, stretches before him, promising both unimaginable discovery and certain annihilation.
