
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salt spray clinging to our roughspun clothes as we embarked on a perilous trek eastward.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way through the sun-baked plains of Provence, then clawed its way over the unforgiving Alps, the icy wind a constant threat.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches, spurred us onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The Althea, a starship forged from the remnants of a dying sun, carried us across the vast gulf between galaxies.  We navigated nebulae of iridescent dust and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets, the hum of the warp drive a constant companion.  While lacking the immediate dangers of bandits and blizzards, the unknown dangers of deep space loomed –  uncharted wormholes, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, fuelled our journey into the unfathomable expanse of the cosmos.
