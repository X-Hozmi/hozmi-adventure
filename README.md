
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves thudding a weary rhythm against the unforgiving terrain.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the legendary city, and the hope it offered, spurred them on through the harsh beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of unimaginable cosmic landscapes, but also presented unimaginable dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Despite the technological advancements, the spirit of exploration remained the same: a brave venture into the unknown, fuelled by hope and a thirst for discovery across the vast expanse of space.
