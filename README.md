
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city of gold and magic, said to be hidden deep within the Whispering Woods.  He’d traded his family’s meager harvest for a sturdy steed and a rusted sword, risking everything for the chance to uncover Eldoria’s secrets and perhaps, escape the crushing poverty of his village.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the inky void, its hyperdrive humming a song of unimaginable speed.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  But the potential discovery of alien life, of new civilizations and technologies, far outweighed the risks for Eva and her crew.  The cosmos was their frontier, and the unknown, their irresistible allure.
