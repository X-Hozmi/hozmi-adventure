
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step a battle against the biting wind.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between me and the fabled city of Zerzura.  My meager supplies – dried meat, a waterskin nearly empty, and a worn map promising riches beyond measure – were all that stood between me and the harsh realities of a winter crossing.  Every rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down my spine, the whispers of bandits or worse, echoing in the desolate landscape.  Survival, not glory, was the only treasure I could truly hope for.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of colours marking our arrival at the Andromeda galaxy. This wasn't just another trade run; this was the first human expedition to this distant spiral.  The risks were astronomical – uncharted systems, potentially hostile alien life, and the ever-present danger of navigational errors in the unforgiving void. But the potential rewards, the chance to uncover the secrets of a new galaxy, outweighed the fear.  The cosmos awaited, a boundless ocean of stars ripe for exploration.
