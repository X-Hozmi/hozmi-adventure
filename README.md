
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The dust of the King's Road clung to his throat, a gritty testament to the weeks spent traversing the unforgiving landscape.  Rumors of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and guarded by monstrous beasts, fueled his relentless journey.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of untold riches, and the burning desire for glory pushed him ever closer to his unknown destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of cosmic wonders unfolding outside her viewport.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory space pirates of the Orion Arm were commonplace hazards. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested her courage and skill daily. Yet, the hope of discovering new life and charting unmapped galaxies spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer chasing a different kind of legendary treasure.
