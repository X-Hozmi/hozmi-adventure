
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the rumored monastery of St. Jude, said to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged her village.  Her journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unseen.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a victory hard-won against the elements and the darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, ORION, calmly reporting on the fluctuating gravitational pulls.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane-rich planet Kepler-186f, a journey requiring precise navigation through uncharted asteroid fields and potentially hostile alien territories.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held an equally terrifying potential for disaster. Yet, the lure of discovery and the promise of scientific advancement fueled her relentless pursuit across the galaxy.
