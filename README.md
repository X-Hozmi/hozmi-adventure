
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry; it was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Constantinople a beacon in the vast, uncertain expanse before her.  Each hardship forged her resolve, transforming her into something stronger, more resilient than she’d ever imagined.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and charting unmapped nebulae was a constant gamble, but the potential rewards – the discovery of new life, new worlds teeming with untold resources – outweighed the risks.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the colonized galaxy, shared a common bond: the insatiable hunger for the unknown, the daring to push the boundaries of human exploration, and the unwavering belief that the vast cosmos held secrets beyond their wildest dreams.
