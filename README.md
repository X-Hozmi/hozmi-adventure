
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless heat and the gnawing fear of bandits.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a jolt of adrenaline through him; every shadow held the potential for ambush.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre and secure a sacred relic – was fraught with peril, a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, unexpected encounters, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  He pressed on, fueled by duty and a flicker of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation threatened their shields, asteroid fields demanded precise navigation, and the vast emptiness of space held a chilling loneliness.  But Eva, alongside her diverse crew, pressed forward, driven by the same human spirit of exploration that propelled Sir Reginald centuries before, their sights set on charting the unknown frontiers of the galaxy.
