
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, mirroring the turmoil in his own heart. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whisper of Ys, a city of shimmering spires and healing waters, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unknown celestial phenomena and the ever-present risk of pirate attacks.  Sophisticated sensors hummed, plotting a course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, while Eva’s crew battled the monotony and the isolation of interstellar travel, their collective hope pinned on the discovery of new worlds and unimaginable resources.
