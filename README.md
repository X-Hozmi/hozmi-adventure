
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, a biting wind whipping my cloak around me.  Each step was a gamble, the path barely discernible amidst the snow and ice. My meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches, the only fuel for my weary soul.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the unforgiving wilderness surrounding me.  Survival, not glory, was the true adventure.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Through the viewport, a swirling nebula painted the blackness with ethereal colours, a breathtaking sight far removed from the gritty realities of navigating asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. My mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of our fragile place within the cosmic ocean.
