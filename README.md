Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the lost city, its promised riches and untold secrets, spurred her onward, each sunrise painting a new, breathtaking vista, each hardship forging her resolve.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world light years from her home in the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate convoys, and battling unpredictable temporal distortions were all in a day’s work for a seasoned spacefarer.  But the vast, breathtaking canvas of the cosmos, the alien landscapes glimpsed through her viewport, and the thrill of exploring uncharted territories far surpassed any danger, igniting within her the same adventurous spirit that had driven her medieval predecessors across continents.
