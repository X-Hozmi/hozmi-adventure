
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s retinue trudged across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests,  rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed hope, the glint of distant mountains a promise of progress, and the shared hardships forging bonds stronger than any castle wall. Their adventure was not simply about reaching their destination, but about the shared experience, the resilience tested, and the tales that would be told for generations.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the cosmic dust and the threat of rogue asteroids. Faster-than-light travel was a double-edged sword; the exhilarating speed was countered by the bone-jarring G-forces and the isolation of interstellar space.  Yet, the breathtaking vistas of nebulas painted across the void, the discovery of new life forms, and the thrill of charting the unknown fueled her relentless pursuit of exploration, a modern-day odyssey among the stars.
