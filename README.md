
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the unpredictable wrath of nature, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of untold riches and exotic spices, outweighs the peril.  We press onward, a thread in the vast human tapestry, seeking fortune and adventure in a world teeming with both beauty and brutality.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a starship shimmering like a captured nebula, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  But the vastness of space harbors its own dangers—uncharted nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien lifeforms.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the tantalizing glimpse of new worlds and civilizations, fuels our journey across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
