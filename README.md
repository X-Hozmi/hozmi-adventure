
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers ran swift and treacherous, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, as she navigated a world both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, but the mission to Kepler-186f was far from a sightseeing tour.  They carried vital terraforming equipment, a desperate gamble to establish a new human colony.  The dangers weren't bandits or disease, but unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms potentially lurking in the uncharted sectors, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure millions of light-years from home.  Yet, the potential rewards – a new beginning for humanity – fueled her determination to press on.
