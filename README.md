
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her small caravan, a motley collection of pack animals and weary travelers, inched across the unforgiving landscape towards the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors spoke of unimaginable riches and dangers beyond imagining – sandstorms that could swallow a man whole, bandits lurking in the canyons, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Zerzura, a city lost to time, spurred Elara onwards, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating hope.

Millennia later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony, Rexx felt the familiar thrill of the unknown.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and inspiring, a boundless canvas of adventure where the only limits were the courage and skill of the pilot.
