
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the urgency gnawing at her heart. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of perilous adventure, a gamble for survival against the unforgiving landscape and the ticking clock.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Kerrigan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a tapestry woven with the hum of hyperdrive engines and the static crackle of subspace comms, was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos. Yet, the lure of discovery, the possibility of finding new life and unlocking galactic secrets, fueled her relentless pursuit across the star-strewn void.
