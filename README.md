
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of sweat and dried grass heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a single, precious map, promising a legendary lost city nestled deep within the untamed forests to the east.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the unforgiving terrain itself.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The ship's AI hummed softly, navigating the treacherous cosmic currents between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  The vast, inky blackness outside held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  But the possibility of a new beginning, a fresh start for humanity, far outweighed any risk.
