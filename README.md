
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guides her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each sunrise brings the promise of breathtaking vistas and terrifying encounters, a constant dance between hope and despair fueled by the legend of a lost oasis and the unshakeable spirit of a woman determined to find it.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Raxon pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting the cockpit in hues of alien beauty.  His mission: to retrieve the lost data-crystals from the derelict research station orbiting Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships, Rexx faces dangers far removed from medieval hardship, but the thrill of exploration and the allure of the unknown remain unchanged, a timeless human hunger for discovery across the vast expanse of space.
