
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a stolen map promising the location of a legendary lost city.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Her journey is fraught with peril, but the allure of discovery, the whispered tales of untold riches and forgotten magic, fuels her onward, her spirit as strong as the steed beneath her.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a dwindling human population.  The journey is a lonely one, punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the vast, inky blackness of space.  Nebulae swirl like cosmic brushstrokes, and distant galaxies glimmer like fallen stars.  Yet, the challenges are far greater than any medieval knight could imagine – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of equipment failure.  Eva's courage and unwavering determination are her only weapons against the unforgiving void.
