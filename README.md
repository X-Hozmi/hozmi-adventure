
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in Eldoria's rumored healing waters spurred him on, pushing him through the relentless hardships of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Andromeda galaxy and the Sol system, a journey fraught with peril.

But the promise of interstellar commerce, and the thrill of charting the unknown, fueled her unwavering resolve to conquer the vast emptiness between worlds.
