
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation dogged his every step.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience, a testament to the thrill of the unknown that drove him across the vast, uncharted landscape of the medieval world.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems under the weight of interstellar radiation were commonplace.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the thrill of discovering new worlds fuelled her unwavering resolve, proving that the spirit of adventure, though expressed in different forms, transcends time itself.
