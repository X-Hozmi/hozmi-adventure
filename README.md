
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred them relentlessly forward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet brimming with a rare energy source vital to the survival of her people.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirate fleet, Elara and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils, but the promise of Xylos – and the fate of billions – fueled their daring journey through the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
