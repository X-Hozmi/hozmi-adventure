
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the shadows, torrential downpours turning paths into raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of the distant castle, his promised reward for the delivery of this vital message, fueled his determination.  Each creak of saddle leather, each labored breath of his horse, was a testament to the hardship and heroism of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been smoother than expected, yet the interstellar journey was far from over.  Navigation charts flickered across her console, displaying the hazardous asteroid fields they'd soon encounter.  Though her ship possessed technology incomprehensible to Sir Reginald, the same spirit of adventure, the same thirst for the unknown, fueled her voyage across the vast expanse of space, a quest for knowledge and discovery as perilous as any medieval knight's.
