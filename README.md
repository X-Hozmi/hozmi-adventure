
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their battered packhorses strained under the weight of supplies, their destination a whispered rumour – Eldoria, a city said to hold the mythical Sunstone.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were their constant companions, but the lure of legend fueled their relentless journey across the vast, uncharted lands of the Holy Roman Empire. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to their grit and determination.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' a sleek starship slicing through the inky blackness between Andromeda and the Milky Way. Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to possess knowledge of faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were all in a day's work. But the possibility of discovering a new era of galactic exploration spurred her onward, a modern-day adventurer forging a path across the cosmic sea.
