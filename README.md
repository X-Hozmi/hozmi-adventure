
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a chipped map.  The journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked every village.  Yet, the glint of the distant Alps, a promise of safety and healing, spurred her onward, each creak of the mule's saddle a rhythmic beat against the relentless drum of uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by a thousand stars and guided by the faint, hopeful signal from a distant colony.  The journey across galaxies was measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hyperspace travel, punctuated by the routine hum of the engines and the occasional hiss of a meteor shower.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, held the promise of new worlds, new challenges, and the bittersweet reunion that fueled her relentless trek across the cosmic ocean.
