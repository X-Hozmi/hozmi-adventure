
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resolve daily.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching their destination, but also the grim reality of another day's relentless travel across a land teeming with both beauty and brutal indifference.  The clatter of their horses' hooves was a constant rhythm to their arduous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps across light years were commonplace, yet the unknown dangers of uncharted space, from rogue asteroids to hostile alien encounters, kept her crew on edge. The vastness of the galaxy, breathtaking and terrifying in equal measure, offered a different kind of adventure, one measured not in leagues, but in lightyears.
