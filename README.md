
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned – a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the legendary city of Eldoria before winter’s grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions on her arduous journey across the known world.  The whispers of Eldoria, a city of untold riches and magic, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation system.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The thrill of exploration was a powerful drug, tempered by the ever-present risk of hyperspace anomalies and the unknown dangers lurking on uncharted worlds.  The vast expanse of the cosmos stretched before her, a testament to humanity's insatiable curiosity, but also a humbling reminder of its smallness in the face of infinite possibility.
