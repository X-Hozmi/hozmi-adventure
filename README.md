
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary steed as she crests a windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but a vital message for a besieged prince, a mission undertaken at great personal risk.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to break her resolve.  But the hope of success, the thrill of facing the unknown, keeps her pushing forward, a lone figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, are bound for Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of the Kryll pirates, a ruthless spacefaring syndicate, are just some of the perils they face.  The vastness of space, filled with both wonder and terrifying unknowns, fuels their insatiable thirst for discovery, a modern-day quest as perilous and exhilarating as any medieval pilgrimage.
