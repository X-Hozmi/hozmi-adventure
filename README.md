
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous Wilderlands was proving more arduous than the chronicles had foretold.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested his mettle and the loyalty of his small band.

Yet, the potential discovery of a new form of energy, vital to humanity's survival, outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held the promise of a future humanity desperately needed.
