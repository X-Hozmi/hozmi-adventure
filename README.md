
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their worn packhorses trudged onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the creeping despair of a journey with no guaranteed end.  They crossed treacherous mountain passes, forded raging rivers, and bartered meager supplies in dust-choked villages, their hope fueled by whispers and ancient maps.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' across the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and our own.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of preventing a devastating solar flare predicted to engulf her homeworld.  The journey was fraught with perils of its own – unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on interstellar travelers.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each distant star a beacon of hope in the infinite darkness.
