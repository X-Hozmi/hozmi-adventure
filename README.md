
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel bumping against her thigh.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death are constant companions, but the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold ancient magic, pushes her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each river crossing, is a gamble, a test of her courage and resilience against a world both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.  The journey is less about the destination and more about the forging of a soul tested by hardship and strengthened by the open road.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Theron pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly years ago.  The vastness of space, peppered with the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, is a constant reminder of her insignificance, yet the potential for discovery and the weight of responsibility for her crew fuel her drive.  Each jump through hyperspace, each encounter with unknown celestial bodies, is a risk, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by the hope of finding not just a lost colony, but a new understanding of the universe itself.
