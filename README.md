
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried rations and a chipped map, its promises of a fabled city shimmering as elusively as the distant horizon.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, yet the lure of adventure, of untold riches and forgotten knowledge, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerian piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unmapped galaxy of Aethel.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and mercenaries, shared her thirst for the unknown.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates were just a few of the perils they faced,  the vast, beautiful, and terrifying emptiness of space a constant reminder of the scale of their ambition – and the potential for both glory and annihilation.
