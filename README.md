
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under the relentless sun, urged his weary steed onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  He'd been traveling for months, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and arcane secrets. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger had tested him, but the whispers of Zerzura, and the glint of gold imagined in his mind, pushed him ever forward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Alien encounters, hostile pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of system failures were the price of exploration, but the hope of reuniting with the lost colonists, and uncovering the secrets of Xylos' advanced technology, spurred her onward, a lone explorer against the infinite expanse of space.
