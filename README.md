
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden villages he'd left behind. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of disease.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, balanced against the gnawing fear of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Elara piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids across the vast gulf between galaxies was a daily challenge, her ship a fragile speck in the immensity of space.  The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the risks, fueling her relentless pursuit of the unknown and the promise of a future beyond the stars.
