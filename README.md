
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of exotic spices and silks that fueled his journey east.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harsh realities of a land unknown.  He carried little beyond his sword, a worn map, and the unshakeable hope of finding fortune and adventure beyond the familiar borders of his homeland.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, the familiar hum of the ship's engines a comforting counterpoint to the silent, star-dusted void. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown,  but the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the universe's secrets, spurred her onward,  a modern-day explorer charting a course through the cosmos.
