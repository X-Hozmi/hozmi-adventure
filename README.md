
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a city of gold and magic.  Each creak of my saddle, each rustle in the snow-laden pines, sent a shiver of anticipation and fear down my spine. Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving elements were but a few of the obstacles between me and my destiny.  My only allies were my trusty steed and the flickering flame of hope in my heart.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The destination: Xylos, a planet teeming with the Xylan crystal, a substance crucial to sustaining life across the Federation.  This wasn't a journey measured in leagues, but in light-years, each jump a gamble against space-time anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. While lacking the immediate physical dangers of medieval travel, the loneliness of deep space and the ever-present threat of unseen dangers presented a different, but equally daunting, adventure.
