
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched landscape, the midday sun beating down on her meager supplies.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, felt as endless as the shimmering heat haze.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the lost city, and the possibility of uncovering forgotten secrets, spurred her onward, a lone speck against the vast and unforgiving expanse of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his heart thrumming with a different kind of anticipation.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been perilous, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits. Now, they were on the precipice of discovering a new habitable planet, rumored to hold the key to solving the galactic famine.  The vastness of space, a cold and unforgiving void, was a different kind of wilderness than the one Elara faced, but the courage and resilience needed to traverse such unknowns remained a constant, woven into the fabric of human exploration across time and space.
