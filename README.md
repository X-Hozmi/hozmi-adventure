
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled my nostrils, a stark contrast to the salt spray of the coast I'd left behind weeks ago.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, a place of untold riches and even more perilous challenges.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the obstacles between me and my destiny.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Vast nebulae painted the viewport in hues unseen on any Earthly canvas as we navigated the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  My crew, a motley bunch of explorers and mercenaries, held their breath as the jump coordinates were finalized.  This was no mere sightseeing trip; we sought the legendary Xylos system, a place said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a secret that could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration, or end us all.
