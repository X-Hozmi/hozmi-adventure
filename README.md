
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor substitute for the fear gnawing at her stomach.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled in the Pyrenees, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the gnawing uncertainty; would she reach her destination in time?  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset, the bitter taste of potential failure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the velvet void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the thrill of exploration never faded.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting constant as Ryla navigated asteroid fields and charted unmapped nebulae, her crew a band of diverse specialists united by the thirst for discovery.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology that could solve the galaxy's energy crisis, a quest as perilous as any medieval pilgrimage, but amongst the stars.
