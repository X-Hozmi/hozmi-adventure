Its inhabitants, a motley crew of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, were bound for the fabled city of El Dorado, a place whispered to be adorned in gold and overflowing with riches. Their journey was fraught with danger: bandits roamed the countryside, wild animals lurked in the forests, and treacherous mountain passes loomed ahead.
