
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the canyons, rivers ran dry, and the relentless heat threatened to break her spirit.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis in a sea of sand, kept her moving, fueling her unwavering determination despite the hardships.

Millennia later, Captain Rexx steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the navigation console. Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos galaxy, a region teeming with uncharted planets and potentially hostile alien life. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held an inherent danger.  Unpredictable asteroid fields, powerful gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble, yet the allure of the unknown propelled Rexx and his crew forward into the cosmic frontier.
