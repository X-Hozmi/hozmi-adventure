
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her sweat-soaked skin.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees loom, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against fate. Yet, the whispered promise of a life beyond the ravaged lands fuels her onward, a beacon brighter than any star in the darkening sky.


Centuries later, Captain Jax surveys the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy is fraught with its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Jax, hardened by years of traversing the cosmic wilderness, feels the familiar thrill of adventure coursing through her veins.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space is a challenge, and she, along with her crew, are ready to face it.
