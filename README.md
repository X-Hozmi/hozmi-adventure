
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to possess a relic capable of curing the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unseen horrors whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires.  His journey was a gamble against time, against the elements, and against the very fabric of a perilous world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the discovery of a new energy source vital to the survival of the Sol Federation.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pull of dying stars was child's play compared to the political machinations and interstellar rivalries threatening her mission.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
