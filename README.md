
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched his well-worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys across the rugged terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the mule's harness, each rustle in the nearby forest, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present chill of starvation.  His quest, to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, fueled his weary steps, promising untold riches and glory, if he survived the treacherous path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.  Her mission: to establish first contact with the sentient crystalline beings of the Xylos system, a journey fraught with potential dangers beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  While Thomas faced bandits, Eva faced hostile alien lifeforms and the unpredictable nature of wormholes, both seeking discovery across uncharted territories.
