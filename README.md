
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, scorching heat, or starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope in her emerald eyes burned brighter than the midday sun, fueling her onward, a lone knight errant against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of vibrant colour as the *Stardust Drifter* jumped across the Andromeda galaxy. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was routine, but the loneliness of deep space, the crushing weight of responsibility, and the ever-present threat of the unknown were far more terrifying than any blaster fire. The cosmos held both wonder and peril in equal measure, a galaxy-spanning adventure fueled by a desperate hope for survival and discovery.
