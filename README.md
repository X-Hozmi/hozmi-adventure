
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  His meager supplies dwindled with each creaking mile, the sun a merciless judge in the vast expanse of sand.  He faced bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving desert itself, all for the chance of discovering lost treasures and untold riches.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril and the tantalizing allure of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable nature of the anomaly itself.  Elara and her crew faced the vast emptiness of space, the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, and the terrifying possibility of never returning to Earth, all driven by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the secrets of the lost colony.
