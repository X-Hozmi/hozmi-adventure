
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate moorland, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Dunstan from the clutches of a rogue baron.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the gleam of the holy relic in his mind, and the promise of glory, spurred him onward.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and countless uncharted systems.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate fleets was commonplace. The true challenge, however, was the loneliness of deep space, the crushing weight of responsibility for her crew, and the gnawing uncertainty of whether they would ever return to a familiar sky.  The vastness of the cosmos held both terrifying beauty and breathtaking wonder, a testament to human ambition and the enduring allure of the unknown.
