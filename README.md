
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest – to find the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his village – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across whispering forests haunted by bandits, and into the heart of a land ruled by a capricious and cruel warlord. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by sentient crystalline beings.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and outwitting the complex gravitational forces of a newly discovered black hole were just a few of the perils she faced.  The galaxy was a vast and unforgiving ocean, but the promise of saving her dying homeworld pushed Elara and her crew to the very limits of human endurance.
