
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of opulent cities and treacherous bandits that fueled his journey east.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or death.  His quest: to find a legendary lost scroll said to hold the secrets of alchemical mastery, a journey fraught with peril, but one he embraced with a heart both brave and foolish.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a hypnotic rhythm against the breathtaking backdrop of a million stars.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held infinite possibilities, but also the constant threat of pirates, asteroid fields, and the unknown.  Her mission: to secure Kepler-186f for humanity, a mission as vital as it was perilous.
