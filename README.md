
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of London, a knapsack slung over my shoulder brimming with dried meats and a worn map.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clings to my clothes as I set out for the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Robbers lurk in the shadows of Sherwood Forest, the Black Death stalks the countryside, and the very mountains themselves seem to conspire against the weary traveler.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of distant lands and holy relics, fuels my steps toward the shimmering horizon.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is my constant companion.  We are charting a course through the Cygnus X-1 region, a swirling nebula of unimaginable beauty and terrifying potential.  Each jump through hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  The stars are our guide, yet the vastness of the cosmos is a humbling reminder of humanity's smallness, a stark contrast to the thrilling prospect of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and perhaps, new enemies among the galactic tapestry.
