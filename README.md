
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him across treacherous mountains and sun-baked plains, his meager supplies dwindling with each passing day.  He sought the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His heart ached with worry and the burn of the setting sun mirroring the fire in his belly to continue.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had taken years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable currents of space-time.  Her crew, a motley band of explorers, faced down cosmic storms, navigated asteroid fields, and even encountered alien life – some benevolent, some decidedly hostile.  The discovery of a potentially habitable planet on the far side of the galaxy spurred them on, a beacon of hope in the vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos, a reward for the countless risks they took.
