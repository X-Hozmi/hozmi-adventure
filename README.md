
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promises a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Days melt into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains, treacherous river crossings, and wary encounters with wandering knights and suspicious villagers.  Each sunrise brings the gnawing fear of bandits, and each sunset the dwindling hope of reaching her destination before it's too late.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking vistas of alien planets and star clusters flashing past their viewport.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates is a daily challenge, but the promise of discovering new life forms, new technologies, and expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy fuels her relentless journey into the unknown.
