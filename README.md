
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide to the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey is arduous, a relentless test of endurance against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Yet, with every sunrise, Elara's determination burns brighter, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in the starship 'Stardust'.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  Instead of bandits, he faces cosmic storms and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a gamble against the unforgiving void of space.  Advanced technology eases some of the burden, but the loneliness of interstellar travel is a relentless foe, a constant reminder of the vast, uncaring universe.  Yet, like Elara before him, Jax presses onward, driven by the hope of finding a better future for his people, even across the unimaginable gulf of space.
