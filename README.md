
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Provençal countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, the promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, starvation, or the unexpected kindness of strangers along the arduous path.  The journey was a tapestry woven with fear and exhilaration, the very essence of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs.  The journey across the galaxy was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the vast, glittering panorama of space, the thrill of charting unknown territories, and the anticipation of discovering alien life far outweighed the risks.  This was the ultimate frontier, a cosmic adventure on a scale unimaginable to her medieval predecessors.
