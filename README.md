
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed each sunrise.  Every creak of their worn wagon wheels, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through them, reminding them of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, a constant dance between hope and survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily challenge, the vast emptiness of space a stark contrast to the cramped confines of her ship.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the potential discovery of new life, fueled her every decision. The vast, unforgiving expanse of space presented a different kind of adventure than the medieval world, but the spirit of discovery remained the same.
