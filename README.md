
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised purple sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, was her only guide to the mythical City of Whispers, a place said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses – wolves prowled these heights, and bandits were even more dangerous.  Survival, not comfort, was the traveler's only reward on this perilous journey across the unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky void between galaxies.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with challenges – navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar space.  Yet, the thrill of exploration burned bright within him, fuelled by the promise of untold discoveries and the possibility of reshaping the future of interstellar travel forever.
