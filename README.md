
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin testament to the miles already covered.  The King's ransom, a heavy chest strapped to her pack horse, felt like lead against her aching back.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the dreaded Black Death itself.  Her journey to the distant city of Alexandria was a gamble on survival, a race against time and the ever-present shadows of medieval life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The crimson and gold gas clouds hid untold dangers: asteroid fields, rogue gravity wells, and the unpredictable spatial currents that could tear a ship apart in seconds.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming enzymes to Kepler-186f, a planet on the brink of colonization.  The vastness of space, a canvas of cosmic wonders and silent threats, offered a thrilling, if perilous, route to a future humanity strived to build.
