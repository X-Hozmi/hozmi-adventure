
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword gleaming dully, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous bogs swallowing unsuspecting travelers whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, rumored to grant its possessor untold power, spurred him on.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of both danger and the promise of untold glory.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the galaxy had been a tapestry of breathtaking sights – vibrant planetary rings, colossal gas giants, and the ethereal glow of distant star clusters.  But the void held its own dangers; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders haunted her every hyperspace jump.  The universe was a vast and unforgiving ocean, yet the lure of discovery propelled her forward.
