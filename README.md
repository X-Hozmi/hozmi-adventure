
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone monastery rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed depths of the Whispering Woods.  Each day brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in the valleys, hostile wildlife in the forests, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  Their only companions were the stars above and the unwavering hope burning in their hearts.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course charted for the Xylos system, a journey spanning light years.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space debris was child's play compared to the political machinations and pirate attacks that threatened their mission to secure a vital mineral resource.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers, the crushing loneliness punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms system.  But the promise of untold riches and the advancement of her people fueled her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the galaxy.
