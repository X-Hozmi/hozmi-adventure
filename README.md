
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and meager coins; it held the hope of finding her estranged brother, lost somewhere amongst the sprawling castles and treacherous mountain passes. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and discovery – bandits, warring lords, or perhaps, a serendipitous encounter that would lead her closer to her goal.  The journey was grueling, but the unwavering resolve in her heart fueled her onward, one precarious step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a distant galaxy. The rhythmic hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a stark contrast to the breathtaking cosmic vista outside. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted territories of the cosmos, kept her and her crew pushing forward, towards the edge of known space.
