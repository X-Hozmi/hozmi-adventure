
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the whispered tales of Zaragoza's healing spring fueled her weary steps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in her desperate race against time.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, jumped through hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of the Horsehead behind. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all in a day's work.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space stretched before her, a tapestry woven with wonder and danger, beckoning her ever onward into the cosmic unknown.
