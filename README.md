
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking below the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of untamed landscapes, the kindness of strangers in humble villages, and the ever-present threat of bandits and disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each ache in her bones, was a testament to the miles conquered, a reminder of the unwavering faith that propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and locate a rumored source of rare energy crystals crucial to intergalactic trade. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates was a test of skill and nerve, but the breathtaking vista of planets swirling in cosmic ballet, each a world teeming with untold mysteries, fueled her unwavering determination to complete her mission.
