
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess a miraculous cure for the creeping plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, held the promise of peril—bandits, starvation, or the disease itself lurking around every bend.  This journey was a gamble with death, but survival, and the salvation of her people, depended on it.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, Orion, calmly reporting navigation data.  Their mission: to locate and secure the mythical Xylos Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos held dangers far exceeding bandits and disease; rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the unforgiving vacuum of space were ever-present threats. Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to push the boundaries of human knowledge and unlock unimaginable possibilities, fueled her unwavering determination to reach their destination, even if it meant facing the unknown expanse of the galaxy.
