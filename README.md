
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, had been fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the allure of the unknown and the hope of glory that awaited her at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The vibrant colours of swirling gas clouds and distant, uncharted planets were breathtaking, yet held a hidden danger.  Pirates and rogue corporations lurked in the shadows of hyperspace, vying for control of rare minerals and lucrative trade routes.  With her loyal crew at her side, Ryla faced down laser fire and navigated treacherous asteroid fields, her unwavering determination a beacon against the vast, inky expanse of the cosmos, forever pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
