
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and distant woods filling her lungs. Her worn map, a testament to countless rips and repairs, guided her through treacherous mountain passes and across rushing rivers, each landmark a victory against the elements and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her journey, a beacon in the vast, untamed wilderness.  The risks were immense, but the promise of discovery burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the unmapped galaxy of Andara.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of space still held its terrors – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows between stars.  Andara promised untold riches – new elements, uncharted planets teeming with life, and perhaps, the legendary lost technology of the Ancients. The journey was perilous, but the potential rewards made it a gamble worth taking.
