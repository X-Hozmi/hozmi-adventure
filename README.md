
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, spurred his mount onward. The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy brown curtain obscuring the already fading light.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a rumored haven for brigands and worse, a necessary evil in his quest to reach the Sultan's court in Damascus.  Every creak of saddle leather, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him – a constant reminder of the dangers inherent in traversing the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  His destination, a distant promise against the vast, uncertain horizon.


Centuries hence, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Stars blazed like diamonds scattered across an infinite velvet cloth, while the hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship's hull.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys; yet, like her predecessors, Elara pressed on, driven by the same thirst for exploration that has propelled humankind across the boundaries of both time and space.
