
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his resilience, the promise of Eldoria his only guiding star.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and wrestling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond anything Thomas could have imagined, yet the allure of discovery burned just as brightly in her heart.
