The muddy track, barely a path through the whispering forest, swallowed the sound of their hooves.  His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing king.

Ahead lay untold dangers: hostile alien lifeforms, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of system failure. But the promise of galactic exploration, and the advancement of humankind, fueled her resolve.
