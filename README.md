
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over; rumors of a hidden monastery holding ancient texts fueled her relentless pace, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each rustling bush, each shadow cast by the gnarled trees, held the potential for peril, yet the lure of discovery pushed her ever closer to her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson light painting the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter* in an ethereal glow.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across the Andromeda Galaxy centuries ago.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every warp-speed transit a gamble.  Yet, the promise of uncovering Xylos's secrets – and perhaps even finding a cure for the devastating plague gripping their own world – spurred Jax and her crew onward, across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
