
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, offers little solace against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels a desperate hope: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's icy grip claims her life.  The journey is a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty, a testament to the human spirit's enduring quest for the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx commands the starship *Stardust Drifter*, its sleek hull a sliver against the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and fraught with unpredictable dangers.  From navigating asteroid fields to facing the enigmatic alien civilizations that lurk in the inky black between stars,  Rexx and her crew push the boundaries of human exploration, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a shared thirst for the cosmos' vast, uncharted wonders. The vastness of space, a daunting yet exhilarating canvas, promises discoveries beyond human comprehension.
