
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast, unforgiving landscape that lay between him and his destiny.  The hope of glory, and perhaps survival, fueled his relentless journey.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-lost research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and repairing the ship's increasingly unreliable hyperdrive were just a fraction of the perils she faced. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, promised both incredible discovery and the very real threat of annihilation.
