
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey, testing her strength and resilience at every turn. Yet, the whispered legends of miraculous healings and the unwavering faith of her people fuel her onward, transforming each hardship into a step closer to her goal.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of galactic exploration, the chance to rewrite the history of interstellar travel, makes the risks worthwhile.  The universe waits, beckoning him forward.
