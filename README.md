
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The map, a faded parchment clutched in her sweat-stained hand, promised riches beyond the whispering forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded plague that stalked the land.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold treasures and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, unpredictable tapestry of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Khalil piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a rare crystal from the methane seas of Kepler-186f, a planet light years from their home in the Andromeda galaxy. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace; the true peril lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the alien entities rumored to dwell in the uncharted regions of the cosmos.  The riches promised paled beside the thrill of discovery and the sheer audacity of pushing the boundaries of known space.
