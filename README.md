
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the grime of a thousand leagues, urges his weary horse onward.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  The glint of steel in the distance might be a fellow traveler...or a deadly foe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of pirate attacks from the Kryll Syndicate, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps make every voyage a high-stakes gamble.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy offers both breathtaking wonders and terrifying dangers, a constant push and pull between exploration and survival.
