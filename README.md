
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his retinue pushed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing hunger that threatened to break their resolve.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed,  navigational computers whirred, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her.  Alien encounters, treacherous asteroid fields, and the constant threat of system failures were her daily bread.  But the promise of finding her lost kin fueled her journey through the unimaginable distances of the universe.
