
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as his weary horse picks its way across the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy. Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, and the relentless sun beats down, but the thrill of the unknown fuels his journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, whispers of potential peril and unexpected discovery.  He carries with him not only his sword and meager supplies but the hope of uncovering a truth lost to time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unmapped gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the inky blackness between stars.  But the lure of unexplored worlds, the promise of discovering new civilizations and alien wonders, surpasses all fear.  The cosmos unfolds before her, a boundless canvas of adventure waiting to be charted.
