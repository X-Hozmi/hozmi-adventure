
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward. The sun beat down on the cracked earth of the King's Road, a ribbon of barely-there track snaking through the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon – was a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the chilling possibility of failure.  Yet, the fire of determination burned bright within her, fueled by loyalty and the hope of reaching her destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, however, was far from routine.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate attacks, and maintaining the fragile life support systems were constant battles.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on him, a stark reminder of the risks and rewards of interstellar exploration.  The promise of discovery, however, propelled him onward, a beacon in the inky black.
