
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet within the Andromeda Galaxy, a planet capable of sustaining humanity's desperate exodus from a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, and constantly battling system malfunctions tested her crew's skills and resilience. The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both magnificent beauty and unimaginable peril, making their intergalactic voyage a harrowing adventure far exceeding anything their ancestors could have ever imagined.
