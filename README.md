The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns – tales of far-off lands, of shimmering silks and potent spices.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every step.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience in a world where the journey itself was the greatest adventure.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, beautiful nebulas were mere inconveniences compared to the existential dread of deep space travel – the crushing loneliness, the constant threat of system failures, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien life, friend or foe. Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of charting the unknown, fuelled her relentless pursuit across the vast, unforgiving canvas of the cosmos.
