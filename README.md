Her journey, a desperate pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken her through forests teeming with bandits, across rivers swollen with spring rains, and into villages where suspicion and fear clung to the air thicker than the woodsmoke. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager meals with wary locals, yet the unwavering faith in her heart spurred her onward.  The path ahead remained uncertain, but the adventure, fraught with peril and hardship, was hers.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a gamble based on a centuries-old, barely decipherable transmission.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and grappling with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel was all part of a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva. The vastness of the cosmos was both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to a new star system revealing breathtaking wonders and hidden dangers, a far cry from the terrestrial challenges of her ancestors. The search was perilous, but the potential rewards—the discovery of a lost civilization—made the risks worthwhile.
