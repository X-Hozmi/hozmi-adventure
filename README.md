
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, dust caked and sun-scorched, trudged onward across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Each step brought the chilling rasp of leather on cobblestone, the rhythmic clang of our meager possessions, and the ever-present fear of bandits or worse – the plague that stalked the land like a phantom.  We sought the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie beneath the waves, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold riches and glory.  The distant peaks of the Armorican mountains offered little comfort, their shadows lengthening as the sun dipped towards the horizon, reminding us of the vastness of our undertaking and the uncertainty of our destination.

Centuries later, the star-lanes hummed with the warp drive of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust a breathtaking backdrop to our quest for the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the possibility of encountering hostile K'tharr raiders or even encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of peril – isolation, the constant threat of equipment failure, and the gnawing uncertainty of finding our goal before our supplies dwindled to nothing.
