
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the constant ache of saddle sores, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheel and every distant hawk's cry, a thrill pulsed through her. This perilous journey to the rumored Silk Road city of Samarkand, a quest for exotic spices and forgotten lore, was a gamble with life itself, but the promise of untold riches and adventure fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormhole currents still demanded skill and nerve.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far-flung planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and breathtaking alien landscapes. The stakes were galactic; failure meant the demise of countless colonies.  But for Jaxx, the thrill of exploration far outweighed the peril.
