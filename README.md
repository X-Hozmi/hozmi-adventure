
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, swallowed the midday sun.  Each creak of branches overhead, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic of immense power, a journey fraught with peril and uncertainty, yet one he would undertake for his ailing king.  The promise of glory, or a swift and violent end, lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver gleam against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation through the treacherous Kepler-186f nebula presented its own formidable challenges; volatile plasma storms and unpredictable gravitational anomalies threatened to tear the ship apart.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, a desperate search across lightyears of interstellar space.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos held both unimaginable wonders and the chilling possibility of absolute isolation, a test of courage and resilience unlike any faced by Sir Reginald centuries before.
