
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, a perilous journey to Constantinople to retrieve a sacred relic, had already claimed two of his companions.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous trek across a continent brimming with both beauty and brutal hardship.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, the chance of glory or grim demise.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling Sol Federation.  Warp drives hummed, bending space-time itself to propel her ship across unimaginable distances between star systems.  The thrill of discovery was tempered by the ever-present danger of pirate attacks, uncharted anomalies threatening to rip her ship apart, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The vastness of the cosmos was a breathtaking spectacle, yet every twinkling star held the potential for a fatal encounter.
