
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the glint of gold rumored to be found within Zerzura's walls, and the promise of adventure itself, kept her pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, vibrant colours swirling around her sleek starship.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and potentially encountering alien civilizations both friendly and hostile.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the constant hum of the ship's engines a comforting counterpoint to the silent immensity surrounding her. The thrill of discovery, the unknown awaiting her beyond the next jump, fuelled her relentless drive towards the unexplored frontiers.
