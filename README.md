
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hangs heavy in the air.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to a distant monastery – is fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowy forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs over her every step.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a hard-earned victory, etching a story of grit and determination onto her weary soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present danger of pirate fleets.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space stretches endlessly before her, each star a potential destination, each nebula a breathtaking marvel.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, relies on her skill and courage as they navigate the uncharted territories of the cosmos, driven by the insatiable human desire to explore the unknown.
