
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, legendary home to brigands and worse.  Her quest – to deliver a sacred relic to the abbey in Avignon – seemed more perilous with each creaking step of the mule.  The whispers of bandits, the foreboding silence of the swamp, and the ever-present gnawing hunger fuelled her determination, transforming the journey from a simple pilgrimage into a desperate race against time and the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's ethereal glow.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across the Andromeda galaxy during a catastrophic warp storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr, Ryla relied on her crew's skill and a battered star chart hinting at Xylos's hidden location. The vast, breathtaking expanse of space, both beautiful and deadly, tested their courage and resolve in a voyage that promised both unimaginable discovery and certain doom if they failed.
