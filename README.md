
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping my cloak around me as I traverse the unforgiving peaks of the Carpathian Mountains.  My quest: to reach the fabled city of Kitezh, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are my constant companions, but the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the chase, pushes me onward. Each sunrise reveals a breathtaking, yet perilous, landscape, a testament to the raw beauty and brutal challenge of medieval travel.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we slingshot around a gas giant, its swirling colours a kaleidoscope of purple and ochre.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to harbour sentient crystals.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling brilliance of distant nebulae, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The challenge isn't just physical; navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and potential encounters with hostile alien lifeforms demands unwavering focus and teamwork.  Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new knowledge, outweighs any risk.
