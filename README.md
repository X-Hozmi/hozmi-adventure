
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent winding through the unforgiving French countryside, creaked and groaned under the weight of our meager supplies.  Each sunrise brought the fresh terror of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheels, we edged closer to the rumored riches of the East – silks, spices, and perhaps, even a cure for the plague that stalked our homeland.  The journey was brutal, but the whispered tales of faraway lands fueled our weary spirits and spurred us onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumps between galaxies, navigating the treacherous currents of wormholes.  The thrill of discovery is constant; each new planet teems with alien life forms, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly deadly. While the dangers are different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and hostile alien civilizations – the same adventurous spirit that drove medieval travelers pushes us forward, propelled by the insatiable human need to explore the unknown and map the cosmos.
