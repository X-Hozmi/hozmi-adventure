
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and shadowed forests.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were constant companions on his perilous journey across the known world, each sunrise a gamble against fate. The thrill of the unknown, the allure of discovery, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, constellations shifted into breathtaking kaleidoscopes of color, and the vastness of space pressed upon her, a humbling and terrifying beauty.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and battling the creeping loneliness of interstellar travel were the daily struggles, but the promise of finding her people, of uncovering the mysteries hidden amongst the stars, sustained her through the infinite journey.
