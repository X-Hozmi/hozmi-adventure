
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, whispered to hold the secret to a cure for the Black Death, pushed him relentlessly across treacherous terrain, through bandit-infested forests and across swollen rivers. Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his horse, marked the relentless passage of time and the ever-present threat of the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and unimaginable beauty.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with promise but plagued by unpredictable atmospheric shifts.  The vastness of space, speckled with glittering star clusters and ominous black holes, held both wonder and danger. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the silent, unforgiving expanse between worlds.
