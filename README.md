
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – he was far from the familiar cobblestones of London, deep in the untamed forests of France,  pursuing a rumour of a lost monastery rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the allure of adventure, of discovering something beyond the known world, spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport was breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  Her mission: to navigate the treacherous Kryll Expanse, a region notorious for its unpredictable wormholes and pirate fleets, to reach the Xylos system and secure a vital shipment of rare minerals.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her as she charted a course through the unknown, the fate of her crew and the galaxy itself potentially hanging in the balance.
