
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the unwavering faith in her heart, and the whispered promises of salvation, spurred her onward.  The road was long and treacherous, but the adventure was worth the risk.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula, vibrant colours painting the bridge in shifting hues.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks but in years of hyperspace travel.  Each jump presented a gamble; unforeseen gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were constant companions. But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering a lost civilization, fueled her determination, making the unimaginable distances, and even the potential dangers, a small price to pay for the thrill of galactic exploration.
