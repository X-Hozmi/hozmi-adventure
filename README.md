
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little beyond dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for her brother’s wasting sickness, a journey fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of fear, but the hope for healing fuels her onward.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust Drifter*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, star-dusted canvas outside.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to sustainable energy.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of space pirates are commonplace hazards; the true challenge lies in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, where the fabric of reality bends and tears, threatening to swallow the *Drifter* whole. The weight of galactic peace rests upon her shoulders.
