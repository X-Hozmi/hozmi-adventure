
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise a battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts. Their journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship and hope, punctuated by the camaraderie forged in shared adversity and the breathtaking beauty of a world untamed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with celestial wonders and the chilling emptiness of the void, dwarfed even the most daring terrestrial adventures. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, the potential for discovery balanced precariously against the ever-present threat of pirate attacks and catastrophic system malfunctions.
