
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's ragged band of knights crested the hill, their eyes scanning the endless expanse of the French countryside.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Montsegur, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed forest, and the very ground beneath their horses' hooves seemed to whisper tales of treachery.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, each sunset the chilling certainty that their journey was far from over, a constant battle against the elements, starvation, and unseen enemies.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  The vastness of space, a beautiful, terrifying void, pressed in on them.  While they faced no bandits or starvation, the silent threat of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself were constant companions.  The weight of exploration, the loneliness of interstellar travel, and the hope of discovery fueled their unwavering resolve.
