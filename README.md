
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort from his weary mount, marked another mile on his perilous journey to the Holy Land.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in fairytale.  His quest, a sacred pilgrimage mingled with a desperate search for a lost relic, fueled his relentless forward progress.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula, her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The vast distances between star systems felt insurmountable, each alien world a new challenge demanding resourcefulness and courage.  Her mission, a desperate search for a habitable planet for a dying colony, pressed upon her, the weight of thousands of lives resting on her shoulders and the reliability of her aging ship.
