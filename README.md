
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling to their doom, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, fueled by whispered tales of unimaginable riches and exotic cultures beyond her wildest dreams.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos reflected in the viewport of his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Faster-than-light travel held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of reuniting a fractured civilization, the chance to uncover the secrets of a forgotten age, was a siren song that even the vast expanse of space couldn't drown out.
