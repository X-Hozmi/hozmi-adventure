
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on our backs.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to house bandits and worse.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down our spines.  Our quest? To deliver a vital message to the Duke, a message that could determine the fate of our kingdom. The rough-hewn tracks were our only guide, the unwavering stars our only solace in the vast, unknown expanse of the land.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we leaped across the void, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But the galaxy is a dangerous place, pirates lurk in the shadows of asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes keeps us on edge.  Each jump is a gamble, each encounter a potential end, but the potential reward, a future free from conflict, makes the risk worth taking.
