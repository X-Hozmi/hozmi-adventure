
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched Provençal plains, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less frightening than the reason for her journey: to reach the rumored monastery in the far north, holding the key to her family's lost legacy.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with rival travelers, and the constant gnawing hunger – yet the unwavering hope of discovery fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the answer to humanity's dwindling resources.  The vastness of space was a breathtaking and terrifying expanse, populated by uncharted anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, like Elara before her, Eva pressed on, driven by the promise of a future secured, not by the treasures of a forgotten past, but by the potential of a new world.
