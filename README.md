
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of dry grass and distant woods clinging to the air.  Her worn map, a tattered piece of parchment, offered little comfort against the uncertainty of the journey.  Each creaking step brought her closer to the fabled city of Zerzura, a legendary oasis whispered about in taverns and sung of in ballads, a destination rumored to hold both untold riches and perilous dangers.  Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colors painted across her viewport were a stark contrast to the cold, metallic hum of the ship.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the potential for encountering unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, spurred her on, a descendant of those medieval adventurers, driven by the same insatiable thirst for discovery and the relentless pull of the unknown.
