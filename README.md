
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored holy relic hidden deep within the Pyrenees, had tested him beyond measure.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger had become familiar companions. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of ancient magic and forgotten kingdoms, fueled his relentless journey, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and breathtaking discoveries.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the enigmatic Xylossian Collective, a civilization dwelling on a planet orbiting a binary sun.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading space pirates were commonplace hazards.  But the true adventure lay in the sheer wonder of it all—discovering new species, charting unexplored star systems, and facing the unfathomable beauty and danger of the cosmos.  The vastness of space, far more daunting than any medieval landscape, only intensified the allure of the unknown.
