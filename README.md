
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of dust and distant smoke.  His quest, a perilous journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy forests where bandits lurked. Each sunrise brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, skirmishes with rival knights, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria's untold riches and ancient magic fueled his unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, a far cry from Reginald's, spanned lightyears instead of leagues.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a constant battle against the unforgiving vacuum of space.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and mercenaries, worked in concert, their lives intertwined with the fate of their ship.  The destination, a rumored planet teeming with untold resources and alien life, held a potential for unimaginable wealth – or catastrophic failure.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, however, held its own magic, just as alluring and perilous as any medieval kingdom.
