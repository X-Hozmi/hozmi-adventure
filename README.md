His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost secrets of the Ancients.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, and the whispered legends fueled his relentless journey across the vast, unknown lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, her breath catching in her throat as the colossal, iridescent rings of Xylos shimmered in the viewport.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders in sleek, black starships, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted space were all part of the thrill, the siren song of galactic exploration calling her ever onwards.
