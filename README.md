
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony struggling against a hostile alien environment on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate raiders were commonplace hazards, but the vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, held its own kind of terrifying majesty.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the galaxy.
