
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, guided his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of Eldoria’s healing balm spurred him onward, pushing him through the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring exploration of the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  The vast distances between stars presented unimaginable challenges – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien life forms, and the constant threat of ship malfunction.  Yet, the promise of new worlds, new knowledge, and the potential for a better future propelled her across the unimaginable expanse of the cosmos, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
