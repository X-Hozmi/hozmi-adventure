
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of reaching Avignon before winter's icy grip claimed her and her precious cargo – a scroll detailing a rumored cure for the Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, fueled her fear and determination in equal measure, the adventure a constant tightrope walk between survival and oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas. The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace, was risky – a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate fleets lurking in the void.  The thrill of discovery battled the ever-present danger; the vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and deadly secrets, making every light-year a test of courage and skill.
