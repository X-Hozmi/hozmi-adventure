
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the mythical city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and whispers of monstrous beasts echoed in the night.  But the lure of Eldoria, a city said to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother, spurred her onward, each day a gamble against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the red alert lights flashing a frantic rhythm.  Their jump to the Andromeda galaxy had gone awry, spitting the *Stardust Drifter* into a swirling nebula of unpredictable energy currents.  Navigating this cosmic maelstrom was a fight for survival, the ship buffeted by gravitational forces that threatened to tear it apart.  But the promise of a new world, a planet teeming with untold resources and knowledge, fueled their desperate struggle against the unforgiving vastness of space.
