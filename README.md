
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's decree, a parchment clutched tight in his hand, promised riches beyond imagining – a mythical city whispered to exist beyond the Dragon's Tooth Mountains.  His journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the mountains themselves seemed to bristle with an ancient, malevolent energy. Yet, with each sunrise, Thomas pressed on, fueled by hope and a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the void years ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the existential dread of interstellar travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns, was a constant reminder of her isolation, but the possibility of finding survivors, of uncovering a forgotten history, pushed her ever forward, a solitary explorer charting the unknown expanse of the galaxy.
