
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that tested their resolve.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the uncharted, pushed them relentlessly forward, their hearts filled with a heady mix of fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the glittering tapestry of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of peril – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the ever-present threat of space debris, and the loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the promise of discovering new life, of charting unknown territories in the cosmic ocean, fueled her unwavering spirit, making the daunting journey worthwhile.
