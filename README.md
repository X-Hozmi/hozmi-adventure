The dust of the King's Road billowed behind them, a testament to their weeks-long journey across the unforgiving plains of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the glory awaiting them at the far edge of the known world – the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.

Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and the ever-present risk of system malfunctions were all in a day's work for a seasoned galaxy-hopper.  The search for new life, new worlds, was a far cry from the medieval quests of old, yet the thrill of exploration burned just as bright in her heart.
