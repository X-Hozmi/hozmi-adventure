
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – he was far from the familiar fields of his birth, deep in the untamed forests rumored to house brigands and worse.  His quest, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine promising healing for his ailing sister, was a perilous gamble against the unpredictable elements and the even more unpredictable nature of men. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the vast and dangerous unknown that stretched before him.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones, a familiar comfort in the face of the breathtaking, and terrifying, immensity of space.  Asteroids, like glittering ice shards, peppered her path, demanding constant vigilance.  The galaxy held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers far exceeding any earthly threat; pirates, rogue AI, and the ever-present, lurking void itself.  Her mission was a gamble on a scale unimaginable to Thomas, a race against time and the vast distances between worlds.
