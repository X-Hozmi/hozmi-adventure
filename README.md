
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his horse weary, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him and his small band across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests teeming with bandits, and across sun-baked plains where water was rarer than gold.  Their quest – to recover the stolen reliquary of Saint Aethelberht – felt as distant and improbable as the shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth.  Each creak of saddle leather, each snort of their worn steeds, was a testament to the unforgiving nature of their journey, a journey fraught with peril, but propelled by unwavering faith and a king's command.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Unlike the medieval knights before her, Elara's challenges were less bandits and more cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glitter of uncountable stars, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Each jump to warp speed was a gamble, each celestial body a potential hazard.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to find new life and new worlds, fueled her courage and drove her ever onward towards the unknown.
