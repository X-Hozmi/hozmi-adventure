
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the caravan as it lumbered across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic creak of wagon wheels a constant companion to the wind's mournful song.  Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming faintly under the harsh light, squinted at the horizon.  Rumours of a lost city, filled with untold riches and ancient magic, fuelled his perilous journey.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant shadows, but the lure of the unknown propelled him onward, his loyal squire, Thomas, ever at his side. Each sunset brought a new challenge, each sunrise a renewed hope for discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate Earth.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking gently as it navigated asteroid fields and avoided the gravitational pull of dying stars.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the brilliant colours of distant galaxies, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  With her crew, a diverse band of scientists and explorers, she pushed the boundaries of human knowledge, risking everything for a chance at humanity's survival.
