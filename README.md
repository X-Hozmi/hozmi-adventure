
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious, drought-resistant strains destined for a monastery far across the treacherous passes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of potential peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of the distant sun on snow-capped peaks spurred her onward; the promise of a bountiful harvest, a hope for the future, fuelled her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Starseeker*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae painted the viewport in breathtaking hues, a stark contrast to the cold, sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling population of Xylos. The vastness of space held a different kind of danger – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant pressure of dwindling resources.  But the thought of a new dawn, a chance to begin again, propelled her through the endless night, towards a destiny written in the stars.
