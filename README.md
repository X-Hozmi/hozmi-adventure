
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the sprawling French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate hope for healing, had been arduous.  Bandit encounters, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested her spirit and resilience.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering devotion in her heart propelled her onward, the distant spires of the papal palace a shimmering beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of a thousand distant suns.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylanium crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than any earthly wilderness, a loneliness punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the constant vigilance required to navigate the cosmic unknown.
