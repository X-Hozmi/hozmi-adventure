
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s shimmering spires and healing waters fueled their weary steps, transforming the arduous journey into a desperate, thrilling race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, was risky, the hyperspace currents unpredictable.  Alien life forms, both benevolent and hostile, lurked in the uncharted sectors.  But the promise of a new beginning, of terraforming a barren planet and forging a new human destiny, far outweighed the dangers.  The vastness of space held its terrors, but also an unparalleled sense of adventure that pushed humanity further than ever before.
