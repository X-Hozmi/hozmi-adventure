
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll, transforming the once vibrant tapestry of the English countryside into a blur of dusty plains and sparse woodlands. Each creak of his trusty steed, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and magical artifacts, propelled him onward, a solitary knight on a quest fueled by ambition and the intoxicating allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy. Unlike Sir Reginald's arduous journey across continents, hers was a breathtaking dance among nebulae and supernovas.  While dangers remained - rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters - Eva's journey was one of technological marvel and breathtaking scale.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders, replaced the mundane landscapes of the medieval world, offering a different kind of challenge and a different kind of adventure.
