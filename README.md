
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought the agonizing knowledge that his journey was far from over, but the glimmer of hope, the whisper of legend, spurred him relentlessly towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets and potential alliances.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperdrive failures, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were constant challenges.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the possibility of encountering new civilizations, fueled her determination, pushing her ever further into the cosmic unknown.
