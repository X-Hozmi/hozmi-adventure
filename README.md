
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward. The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth, the endless expanse of the plains stretching before her like a shimmering ocean.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of the fabled Silk Road, of untold riches and exotic lands beyond the known world, fueled her relentless journey, a potent elixir against despair and fatigue.  This was not mere travel; it was a pilgrimage of the soul.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexa navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the inherent risks remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present danger of pirate attacks kept her crew on high alert.  Each jump to a new star system brought the promise of discovery, of alien civilizations and unmapped planets rich with resources and mysteries yet to be unveiled.  This was not just interstellar travel; it was the human expansion into the infinite.
