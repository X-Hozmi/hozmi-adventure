
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had taken their toll –  the relentless sun beating down on the dusty track, the constant threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests, the gnawing hunger that seemed an ever-present companion. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, pushed him onward. Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his weary steed, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble on destiny itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey*, a silver needle piercing the inky blackness of interstellar space.  The rhythmic hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting drone against the vast emptiness.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth, promising the discovery of a new habitable world.  The journey, however, was fraught with peril – unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate ships –  but the potential reward, a new home for humanity, was a beacon bright enough to guide her through the darkest reaches of the galaxy.
