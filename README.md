His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.

Pirate attacks, system malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms made each jump a gamble, a thrilling dance between the vastness of space and the fragility of human ambition.
