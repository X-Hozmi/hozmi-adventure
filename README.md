
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Rhineland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, holds the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Her quest, to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, pushes her onward despite the gnawing hunger and the exhaustion that threatens to break her spirit. The journey is a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting kindness from strangers, and the unwavering hope that sustains her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel is fraught with peril; unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien civilizations. The vastness of space dwarfs even the grandest medieval landscapes, yet the human spirit, that unwavering drive to explore, remains the same, pushing Ryla and her crew across unimaginable distances in the search for a new beginning.
