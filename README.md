
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the unpredictable spring rains, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each creak of the saddle and each passing village, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a tapestry of human encounters and breathtaking landscapes weaving a story far richer than any tale told in the taverns back home.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent silence of space. Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the thrill remained the same.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling nebulae and distant suns, held a promise of discovery and adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval pilgrims.
