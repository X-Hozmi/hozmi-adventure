
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fuels his relentless onward march, a single knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with perils unseen.  Cosmic storms threaten to rip her vessel apart, unknown alien lifeforms lurk in the inky blackness between stars, and the relentless pressure of isolation weighs heavily on the crew.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to unravel a galactic mystery, propels them forward across the uncharted expanse of space.
