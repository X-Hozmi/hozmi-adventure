
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-covered plains of Eastern Europe, a stark contrast to the vibrant tales whispered in taverns of Constantinople's bustling markets and the Silk Road's exotic treasures.  Each creak of the saddle, each icy breath, fueled my determination to reach the legendary city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but a journey promising untold riches and experiences far beyond my humble village.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust and gas, paled in comparison to the thrill of charting unmapped territories beyond the known arm of the Milky Way.  Our mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel and resources vital to our survival.  The vastness of space, the unknown dangers lurking in the dark matter, all felt insignificant compared to the potential rewards and the sense of pioneering a new age for humanity.
