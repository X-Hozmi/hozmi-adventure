
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over; whispers of a mythical city, lost to time, fueled her relentless trek.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadowed glen, held the promise of both peril and untold riches – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions.  The allure of discovery, however, far outweighed the risks.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a nebula of swirling purple and gold.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet unforgiving, was a different kind of wilderness than Elara's forest.  Asteroid fields posed a constant threat, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes demanded precise navigation.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting a course to galaxies yet unexplored, was a siren song Eva couldn't resist.
