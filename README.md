
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s worn leather boots as she trudged across the parched landscape, the midday sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in hushed tones amongst desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey, but the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward. Each creaking wagon wheel, each labored breath, was a step closer to the adventure that defined her life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, were charting unmapped nebulae and scanning for habitable planets.  The dangers were different now –  rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the unknown alien lifeforms that might lurk in the shadows.  But the thrill of discovery, the chance to push humanity's boundaries, fueled their journey across the vast cosmic ocean, a quest as audacious and challenging as any medieval pilgrimage.
