
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, spurred his mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the vast plains of the Holy Roman Empire, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and distant battle.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large. Yet, the promise of salvation fueled his weary steps, each sunrise a renewed pledge to persevere.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia of spacetime.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of black holes, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval knights.  Alien life forms, temporal distortions, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure tested their resilience.  But the hope of reconnecting with humanity’s distant past pushed them further, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
