
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was far from over; bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in legend. Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled Sunstone city, a city of unimaginable wealth and power, spurred her onward, fueling her weary limbs and resolute spirit.  Each creak of the saddle, each ache in her bones, was a testament to her unwavering determination.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast emptiness. Her mission: to retrieve the lost fragments of the Xylos artifact, scattered across a dozen star systems after a cataclysmic supernova.  The risks were immeasurable; hostile alien empires, unpredictable nebulae, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions plagued their path.  But the allure of unlocking the Xylos's secrets, a power capable of reshaping entire civilizations, propelled her crew forward, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.
