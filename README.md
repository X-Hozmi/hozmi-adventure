
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, the kindness of strangers in humble villages, and the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new adventure and the unwavering hope of reaching her sacred destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had already spanned decades, a generational odyssey undertaken to find a new home for humanity.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's medieval trek, Eva faced the relentless pressure of maintaining the ship's fragile life support systems, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present psychological toll of interstellar travel—the isolation, the weight of responsibility for her crew's survival, and the gnawing uncertainty of their ultimate success.  But the promise of a new dawn, a new beginning among the stars, propelled her forward.
