
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The map, brittle with age, promised riches and glory in the distant Sultanate – a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit lords, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the obstacles in his path.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance, as he pressed on, the weight of his quest heavy on his heart.  The road ahead remained uncertain, but the lure of adventure spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Faster-than-light jumps were risky, fraught with spatial anomalies and unpredictable gravitational forces.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting a course to worlds beyond imagination, fueled her relentless pursuit. Every jump was a gamble, every star a beacon in the vast, inky expanse of space, beckoning her further into the unknown.
