
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun a relentless hammer on her back.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted with a vital message for the distant King.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the unwavering spirit of adventure fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of reaching her destination and fulfilling her sacred duty.  The road was harsh, but the reward promised a legend.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational fields and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life.  But the thrill of discovery, the potential for uncovering new worlds and technologies, far outweighed the dangers. The vastness of space was terrifying, but the allure of the unknown was irresistible.
