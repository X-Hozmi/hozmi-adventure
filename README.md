
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping at her cloak.  Her destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, testing her courage and resilience, as she pushes onward towards the unknown, driven by a thirst for discovery and a dream of a life beyond the confines of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *Stardust*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the potential for discovery boundless but shadowed by the unknown dangers lurking amongst the stars – rogue asteroids, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  With a crew of seasoned explorers at her side, Eva braves the uncharted cosmos, seeking new worlds and pushing the boundaries of human exploration, a modern-day adventurer in a universe brimming with wonder and peril.
