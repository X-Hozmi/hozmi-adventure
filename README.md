
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the unwavering need to save her people spurred her onward across the treacherous landscape. Each sunrise was a victory, each nightfall a gamble.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered nebula, rumored to contain a previously unknown energy source.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  Yet, fueled by scientific curiosity and a thirst for the unknown, Ryla and her crew navigated the cosmic sea, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the breathtaking, and potentially deadly, expanse of the universe.
