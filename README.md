
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of forests whispered to be haunted.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, the threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown. Yet, the promise of divine grace and the thrill of the open road kept their spirits high, pushing them ever closer to their destination.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies, Elara and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a constant reminder of their isolation and the monumental task ahead, yet the lure of discovery and the hope of finding the lost colonists fueled their intrepid voyage.
