
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the swirling anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, each sunset the gnawing fear of dwindling supplies.  Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones of unimaginable wealth and splendor, drives us onward, a shared ambition binding us together against the harsh realities of the road.  We are bound by a thirst for adventure, for the unknown that lies beyond the next dune.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship boasting engines that bend spacetime, cuts a path through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy. Our mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable worlds.  The breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, from swirling gas giants to shimmering planetary rings, contrasts sharply with the ever-present hum of the ship’s systems and the sterile gleam of the observation deck.  The risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms, or worse, catastrophic space anomalies, is a constant companion, but the boundless promise of discovery fuels our relentless journey across the vast cosmic ocean.
