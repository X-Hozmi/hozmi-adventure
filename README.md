The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and unknown dangers.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.

The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her;  the weight of her responsibility a constant, silent hum in the ship's quiet hum.
