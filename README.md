
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of weary men and beasts, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance in the shimmering heat, mocking our slow progress towards the mythical city of Samarkand.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagons is a testament to the arduous journey, a constant reminder of the bandits, unforgiving terrain, and dwindling supplies that threaten to unravel our quest for the lost scrolls of Ibn Sina.  The whispered tales of djinn and treacherous mountain passes fuel both our fear and our determination.

Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cuts through the inky void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Our mission: to locate a habitable planet for the fleeing remnants of humanity.  The hum of the hyperdrive lulls us into a false sense of security, a deceptive calm before the storm of interstellar navigation.  Nebulae painted across the void, breathtaking in their immensity, are a constant reminder of the scale of our journey and the vast unknowns that lie ahead, perils far exceeding any medieval bandit or desert storm.  The fate of our species hangs in the balance.
