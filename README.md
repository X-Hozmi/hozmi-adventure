
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey to the rumored City of Gold had already claimed two of his companions, felled by fever and bandit alike.  Each sunrise brought new perils – treacherous mountain passes, the ever-present threat of wolves, and the unsettling silence of vast, uncharted forests.  Yet, the glint of the sun on a distant peak fueled his relentless march, a promise of untold riches and glory, a reward worth the constant gnawing fear.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the jump to Xylos’s outermost planet held its own dangers: unpredictable gravitational fields, asteroid storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The mission: to retrieve a rare mineral vital to galactic peace. But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories amongst the stars, was a powerful motivator, a siren song stronger than any risk.
