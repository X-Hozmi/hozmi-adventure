
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, bumped along a rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's illness.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the whispered legends of Eldoria spurred them onward, a tiny speck against the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its multi-hued gases swirling around the ship like a cosmic painter's palette.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the Kepler-186f colony, a fragile outpost on the edge of known space.  Hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present danger of pirate attacks were all part of the routine. But the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the thrill of exploring uncharted territories, and the knowledge that her cargo could mean the survival of an entire world fueled her determination – a lone voyager navigating the infinite expanse of the galaxy.
