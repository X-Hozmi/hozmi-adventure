Sir Kaelan gripped the worn leather of his saddle, the chill wind whipping at his cloak as he surveyed the bleak, mountainous pass.  His quest, to recover the stolen Sunstone, led him through treacherous terrain, past whispering forests and haunted ruins, where every shadow held the potential for ambush.
