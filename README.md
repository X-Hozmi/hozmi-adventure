The King's writ, a crumpled parchment clutched in his gauntlet, promised riches and glory in the distant East, but the reality was days of relentless sun, nights shivering under a vast indifferent sky, and the ever-present threat of bandits and raiders lurking in the shadows of crumbling castles and ancient forests.  Each sunrise brought the tantalizing hope of reaching the fabled Silk Road, a path paved with danger and the lure of unimaginable wealth.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic wonders, was punctuated by the hum of the ship's engines and the constant vigilance required to navigate asteroid fields and unknown gravitational anomalies.  The promise of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of life beyond Earth, fueled her journey, despite the isolating loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown.
