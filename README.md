
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, sparked a fresh surge of adrenaline; bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable elements were constant companions on this desperate journey to escape the Black Death ravaging her village.  The path was arduous, but the hope of survival fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unpredictable alien lifeforms and treacherous terrain.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger than the medieval plains; here, malfunctioning systems and the unknown were the greatest threats, a constant test of skill and courage against the unforgiving vastness of the cosmos.
