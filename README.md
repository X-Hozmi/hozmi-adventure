
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and across rivers swollen with spring thaw. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, navigating by the unreliable stars, and the constant gnawing hunger that tested their resolve.  Their destination, however, fueled their weary steps, a beacon of faith in a world steeped in both beauty and brutal hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across uncharted sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, battling against gravitational tides and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed the challenges of her own personal demons – the loss of her crew, the ever-present weight of command – but the possibility of success spurred her onward, a tiny ship against the backdrop of an infinite universe.
