
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him after a day's hard riding, squinted at the setting sun.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between him and his quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost Scepter of Aethelred.  Bandit trails, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but minor obstacles compared to the rumors of sorcery and dark magic guarding the city itself.  Each day brought new challenges, forging him into a stronger, more resourceful knight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing vital systems were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, however, always instilled a sense of awe and wonder, a reminder of the incredible distances and unknown dangers that lay between the stars.  The galaxy was her canvas, and the *Stardust Drifter*, her brush.
