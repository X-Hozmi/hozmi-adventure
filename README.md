
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that clawed at her belly. Each creak of the saddle, each distant wolf howl, was a test of her courage, a testament to the relentless pull of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the terrifying vastness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory scavengers that lurked between the stars was child’s play compared to the political intrigue and potential betrayal that awaited her on Xylos.  The universe was a grand, perilous playground, and Ryla, its intrepid explorer, was ready to play.
