
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward.  The dusty track wound through a sun-baked landscape, the only companions the relentless drone of cicadas and the occasional hawk circling overhead. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rise and fall of the land, represented a step closer, or further, from hope. Bandits, scorching heat, and starvation were constant threats, making the journey a harrowing test of endurance and will.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, reassuring thrum, a stark contrast to the terrifying void outside.  Navigation charts flickered on holographic displays, while Eva and her crew battled cosmic radiation and the ever-present risk of encountering uncharted space anomalies.  Their mission, to find a new home for humanity, dwarfed the dangers, fueling their courage and pushing them to the very edge of known space.
