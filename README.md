
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn map, more faded than trustworthy, promises a shortcut to the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself are constant companions, yet the whispered tales of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient secrets fuel her onward.  Each creaking step of her weary steed is a step closer to the unknown, a gamble on fate and fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Corvus pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the vast expanse between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  His hyperdrive hums a steady, powerful song against the backdrop of cosmic silence, a symphony of controlled chaos as he navigates treacherous nebulae and avoids the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization said to possess technology beyond human comprehension.  The risk is immeasurable, the reward potentially limitless, and the journey itself a testament to humanity's unending thirst for exploration.
