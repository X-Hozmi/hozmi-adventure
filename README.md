
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the battlefield he'd fled.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his plague-stricken sister.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the even more terrifying unknown.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting kindnesses from strangers, and the unwavering hope fueling his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones, a familiar comfort against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Ahead lay the challenges of navigating treacherous asteroid fields, avoiding pirate fleets, and deciphering the cryptic warnings left by long-dead explorers.  The cosmos held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, a seasoned veteran of countless interstellar voyages, pressed on, driven by the insatiable human thirst for discovery.
