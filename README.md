
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the legendary city of Ys, was fraught with peril. Bandit lords lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, the promise of discovery outweighing the ever-present fear.  She carried with her not just a map, but a dream, woven from stories of ancient magic and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago.  Navigating through treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields, Ryla and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Alien leviathans and rogue gravitational forces tested their mettle, but the lure of a vanished civilization, the hope of finding answers to humanity's origins, propelled them further into the uncharted cosmos.
