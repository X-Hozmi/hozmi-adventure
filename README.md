
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown. Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, its promise of spices and riches beyond imagination, pushes us onward.  The dust-choked air carries whispers of distant cities, of mythical beasts and powerful sultans, fueling our relentless journey across the heart of a vast and unpredictable world.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, obsidian hull of the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky blackness of intergalactic space, its course charted by constellations unseen by earthly eyes.  We are explorers, charting new worlds and encountering civilizations both wondrous and terrifying, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies.  The universe unfolds before us, a boundless tapestry of nebulae and alien wonders, a journey beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers.
