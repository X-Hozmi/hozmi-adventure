
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her and the small caravan.  Their journey across the treacherous Black Mire, rumored to be haunted by bog-things and worse, was far from over.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, fording swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes.  But the promise of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura, a city of gold said to lie beyond the desert, fueled her onward. The risks were immense, but the potential reward, immeasurable.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla adjusted the chronometer on her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Ahead lay the Andromeda galaxy, a breathtaking expanse of nebulae and unexplored systems.  Their mission: to chart the Kepler-186f system and search for signs of habitable planets.  The journey would take generations, requiring the mastery of faster-than-light travel and the resilience to withstand the psychological toll of interstellar isolation.  But the quest for new worlds, for new life, made the seemingly insurmountable challenges of deep space exploration worthwhile.
