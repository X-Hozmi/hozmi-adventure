
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a fragile scroll containing a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the disease itself.  Yet, the hope fueling her journey outweighed every fear, pushing her ever onward towards the distant monastery rumored to hold the answer.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, a symphony of calculated risk and unwavering determination. The promise of new life, new resources, and the thrill of discovery fueled her crew, even as the vast, unknowable expanse of space whispered warnings of unseen dangers.
