
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged highlands as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled her nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village they’d left behind.  Her quest – to deliver a vital message to the King across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains – was fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, fueling her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael stared out the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*, a nebula of iridescent colours swirling across the black expanse.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped Xylos cluster, a journey spanning light years and fraught with gravitational anomalies and pirate fleets.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reminder of the immense power – and the potential for catastrophic failure – of interstellar travel.  The thrill wasn't in the physical exertion, but in the intellectual challenge, the sheer audacity of charting a course through the unknown.
