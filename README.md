
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's small caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wagon wheels a mournful counterpoint to the distant caw of ravens.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the unpredictable terrain tested both beast and man. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of Zerzura's power, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic dust and incandescent gas.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  While free from the immediate dangers of bandits and starvation, the vastness of space presented its own formidable challenges: unpredictable gravitational anomalies, the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, and the psychological toll of years spent in the confines of a starship.  But the promise of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of a galaxy beyond their own, fueled her unwavering determination.
