
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged through the unforgiving landscape, her worn map clutched tight.  The King's decree – to find the legendary Sunstone – had led her far from the familiar cobblestone streets of her village. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispers of mythical beasts chilled the air, yet the allure of the Sunstone, and the promise of untold riches, pushed her onward. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Survival was a daily victory.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate factions was a constant struggle, a far cry from the meticulously planned routes of the Galactic Federation.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of the colony's disappearance, fueled her journey across the vast expanse of the cosmos, a journey where the dangers were less tangible, but no less deadly.
