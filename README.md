
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation all stalked her journey across the vast and treacherous land.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of a thousand burning suns.  Her mission, far more ambitious than Elara's, was to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of celestial wonders, but also held the constant risk of encountering unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadowy reaches of hyperspace.
