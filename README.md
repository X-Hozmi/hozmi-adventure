
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne stretching before her.  Her worn map, patched and faded, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  This journey to Avignon, to deliver the King's secret message, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Yet, the glint of distant spires, promising sanctuary and perhaps even success, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, she relied on the ship's aging hyperdrive and her crew's unwavering loyalty.  The vast emptiness of space offered both thrilling freedom and a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the immensity of the cosmos.
