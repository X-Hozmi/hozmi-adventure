Bandit raids were a constant threat, the forests teemed with wolves, and the whispers of plague followed him like a shadow.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through a nebula shimmering with iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

But the lure of discovery, the chance to find life beyond Earth, fueled her unwavering determination across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
