
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled the air, a stark contrast to the rumors that swirled around him: of a hidden city lost in the Whispering Mountains, of unimaginable riches guarded by mythical beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrill of his adventure, a gamble against the dangers of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His journey, a desperate bid for fortune and glory, was a tapestry woven from equal parts hope and fear.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive resonated through Captain Eva Rostova’s bones.  Gazing out at the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy, she felt a kinship with those medieval adventurers, though her challenges were cosmic in scale.  Instead of bandits, she navigated treacherous asteroid fields; instead of starvation, the threat of oxygen depletion haunted her crew. The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, dwarfed even the wildest medieval fantasy.  Her mission, to locate a rumored lost colony on the edge of explored space, demanded bravery, cunning, and a touch of foolhardy daring—a timeless human pursuit, regardless of era.
