
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, urged his destrier onward. The trail, little more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous mountains, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Every creak of saddle leather, every rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild beasts, or perhaps even something far more sinister.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of magic and untold treasures, spurred them onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in months of hyperspace travel, was punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the ever-present risk of encountering space pirates or unforeseen stellar anomalies.  But the promise of discovery, of finding new life, new worlds, far outweighed the dangers.  For Eva, the vastness of space was not a void, but a boundless ocean teeming with untold wonders, awaiting exploration.
