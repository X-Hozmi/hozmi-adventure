
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s worn boots sank into the mire. Her journey across the Duchy of Aquitaine was a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of beauty – the sun-drenched vineyards of Bordeaux, the imposing silhouette of the Pyrenees mountains, the hushed reverence of ancient, moss-covered ruins.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the quest for her estranged brother fueled her onward, the hope of reunion a flickering candle in the vast darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging the gravitational pull of distant suns was routine for Rexa and her crew.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast distances were mind-boggling, the potential dangers unimaginable – rogue asteroids, uncharted wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of discovery, the thrill of charting the unknown, pushed them onward, toward the edges of the universe.
