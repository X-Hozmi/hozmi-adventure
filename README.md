
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the canyons, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the endless expanse of desert threatened to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each night a desperate scramble for safety and meager sustenance, but the whispered legends of Zerzura, a city of gold and untold wonders, fueled her weary spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different –  unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, burned as brightly as the distant starlight reflected on her visor.
