
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rasp of her worn leather boots against the rocky path, was a testament to her journey.  She carried with her not gold nor jewels, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust*, cut a swathe through the nebula, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Galaxies spun like celestial wheels outside her viewport, a breathtaking panorama of unimaginable scale.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to solving the Great Famine plaguing the unified human colonies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders, and wrestling with the limitations of faster-than-light travel were all in a day's work.  But the promise of salvation, for billions, burned brighter than any star.
