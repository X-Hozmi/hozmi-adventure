Her journey across the kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large.

The fate of millions hung in the balance, a weight he carried alongside the thrill of exploration in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
