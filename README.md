
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone, a relic said to hold the power of the harvest, from the treacherous Baron Malvoisin.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the Sunstone in his mind's eye spurred him onward, promising glory and the salvation of his people.  He carried not only a sword, but also a heart brimming with hope and the unwavering resolve of a knight errant.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Eva.  But the mysteries of the cosmos, and the potential fate of the lost colonists, ignited a powerful sense of adventure within her, pushing her ever closer to the edge of the known galaxy.
