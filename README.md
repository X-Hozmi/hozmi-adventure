
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by both faith and a desperate need to escape a failing harvest, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every creak of the saddle and each breathtaking vista, the adventure ignited a fire within her, stronger than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a thrilling leap into the unknown across unimaginable distances.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethel on the far side of the galaxy.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present danger of pirate attacks made each day a battle for survival.  But for Nova, the exhilaration of charting unmapped territories, the potential for discovery, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweighed the risks.
