
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her and her mule laden with meager supplies.  Ahead lay the vast, untamed forests of Arden, rumored to harbor both mythical beasts and forgotten pathways to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – and danger.  Her journey wasn't mapped; her only guide was the whispered tales of seasoned travelers and the unwavering glint of determination in her own eyes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions was commonplace, yet the thrill of discovery never faded.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable potential, and Eva, ever the pioneer, pressed onward, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.
