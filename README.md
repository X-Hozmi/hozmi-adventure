
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just meager rations; it holds the map promising a hidden monastery rumored to possess the lost Gospel of Judas.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise bringing a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience in her quest for sacred knowledge. The thrill of the unknown, the tantalizing scent of adventure, fuels her every step.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Warp drives hum, the cosmos a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant suns.  Yet, the beauty masks perilous asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system malfunctions.  Each jump into hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the enigmatic vastness, the ultimate test of human ingenuity and daring in their search for a new home among the stars.
