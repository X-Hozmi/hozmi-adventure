
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map – a lifeline in the untamed wilderness separating her from the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the allure of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous politics of intergalactic trade were just two of the challenges facing her crew.  Faster-than-light travel promised untold riches and the discovery of new life, but also held the risk of encountering uncharted dangers – from hostile alien races to unforeseen cosmic anomalies. The vastness of space, though breathtaking, was a lonely and unforgiving frontier.
