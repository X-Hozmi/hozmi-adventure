
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat: bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Her journey was a gamble against death, a desperate dash across a landscape both breathtaking and brutal.  Survival depended not only on her resilience but on the kindness of strangers, the generosity of isolated monasteries, and the unwavering hope that fueled her onward.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void, its hyperdrive spitting her crew into the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to limitless energy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers, they faced dangers far beyond those imagined by medieval travelers.  Each jump through hyperspace was a calculated risk, a gamble against the unknown physics of the universe. Yet the allure of Xylos, and the potential for a future free from energy scarcity, burned brighter than any sun, propelling them through the infinite blackness.
