
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange. Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold ancient magic, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the hope of discovery, pushed her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the celestial chaos.  The risks were immense – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions – but the potential rewards, the promise of new worlds and untold knowledge, far outweighed the dangers.  The cosmos awaited.
