
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a few coins, and a map older than her father.  She was bound for the fabled city of Zaragoza, seeking a cure for her ailing brother, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of the unknown, but also the thrill of the open road, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the hope of reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula NGC 7000, the vibrant hues of the cosmic clouds painting a breathtaking backdrop to her perilous mission.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, rumored to hold the key to solving a galaxy-wide famine.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the occasional asteroid field or rogue black hole, held a different kind of terror, a silent threat far removed from the tangible dangers of the medieval world.  Yet, the quest for survival and the possibility of discovery fueled her journey, a testament to humanity's unwavering spirit of exploration.
