Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation were his constant companions, but the glint of gold in his imagination – and the desperate hope of escaping his poverty-stricken village – spurred him onward. Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary step of his mule, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble with fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane seas of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields, encounters with hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of equipment failure were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyages. But the pursuit of scientific discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars, fueled her courage and drove her ever further into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
