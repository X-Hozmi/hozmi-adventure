
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Ys, with its promised riches and forgotten magic, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.

But the knowledge that her cargo held the key to saving countless lives spurred her on, a beacon guiding her through the perilous expanse between worlds.
