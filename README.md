
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each sunrise brings the promise of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, yet the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand – whispered of in hushed tones in taverns – pushes us onward. The rough-hewn map, filled with cryptic symbols and questionable directions, is our only guide amidst the whispering winds and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  We are bound by a shared thirst for adventure, a desire to test ourselves against the harsh realities of a world unforgiving and wild.


Centuries hence, the *Starseeker* breaches the veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrates through the ship's hull as we navigate through nebulae of unimaginable beauty and navigate perilous asteroid fields.   Unlike the medieval travelers, we face threats far beyond bandits – cosmic radiation, rogue black holes, and the potential hostility of an alien civilization. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of the universe, eclipses the dangers, pushing us ever forward into the boundless expanse of space.
