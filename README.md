
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred on by whispers of a mythical city of gold hidden deep within the whispering forests of Eastern Europe, trudged onward.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, swift rivers demanding perilous crossings, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  The promise of untold riches, however, fueled our resolve, pushing us further into the uncharted wilderness, where the legends of old held their breath.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The colossal starship 'Odyssey' cut through the inky blackness, its hyperdrive humming a lullaby of unimaginable speed. We were charting a course to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The thrill of discovery mingled with the cold dread of the unknown; the vastness of space held both unimaginable wonder and the chilling possibility of encountering something far beyond our comprehension, something utterly alien.
