
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each night brings a new camp, a new threat – bandits lurking in the shadows, the ever-present risk of disease, and the gnawing uncertainty of our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, shimmering like a mirage on the edge of our endurance.  The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in shared hardship, these are the coin of this realm, more valuable than gold.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Starseeker*, a vessel of impossible grace and power, leaps between galaxies, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Our mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump is a gamble, a plunge into the unknown, where derelict space stations haunt the void and sentient nebulae whisper secrets best left undisturbed. Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting the uncharted, fuels our hearts with a fire as bright and ancient as the stars themselves.
