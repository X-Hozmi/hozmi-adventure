
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but a fragile scroll detailing a rumored lost monastery, said to hold the key to a forgotten healing art.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are all challenges Elara must overcome on her perilous journey, fueled by hope and the whispers of ancient prophecies.  Each sunrise brings a new test, each sunset a hard-won victory in her quest across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Jackson pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the aggressive Xylossian space pirates is all in a day's work for Jax and his crew. The vastness of space, a canvas of glittering stars and cosmic wonders, hides untold dangers, but the promise of untold riches and scientific breakthroughs spurs them onward, defying the impossible distances between worlds.
