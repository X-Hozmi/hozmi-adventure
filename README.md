
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of sanctuary in the distant Italian city-states.  Each creak of her saddle, each rocky path, is a testament to the perilous journey, fraught with bandit raids, unforgiving weather, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the allure of freedom, the whisper of a better future, keeps her legs moving, one weary step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Valerius pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian bioluminescent flora to the galactic council on Kepler-186f.  The journey, though technologically advanced, is no less fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threaten to fry his ship's systems, pirate raids are a constant threat, and the sheer vastness of space, the cold, uncaring indifference of the cosmos, weighs heavily on his crew.  But Jax, hardened by years of interstellar travel, grips the controls, his eyes fixed on the distant glimmer of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope in the infinite darkness.
