
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, cloaked in dust and grime, pressed onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Our quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death that ravaged our homeland. Each creak of our wagons, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the sickness itself. We faced down storms that threatened to swallow us whole, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and bartered with suspicious villagers for meager supplies, our resolve fueled by a desperate hope for salvation.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our roadmap.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of interstellar exploration, shuddered slightly as it jumped through the wormhole, emerging into the swirling nebula of Xylos. Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Each jump risked catastrophic engine failure, each planet held the unknown threat of alien life or hostile environments.  Yet, the vast, glittering tapestry of the cosmos, the sheer audacity of pushing the boundaries of known space, spurred us onward, a testament to the enduring human spirit's thirst for discovery.
