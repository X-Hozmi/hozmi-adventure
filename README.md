
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into forests where shadows whispered secrets older than time.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the constant gnawing worry about their dwindling supplies. Yet, the allure of the legendary shrine, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer*, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of celestial phenomena and the chilling silence between stars, was a constant reminder of the immense risks and the even greater rewards of their daring voyage.  Each jump through hyperspace brought them closer to the unknown, and the possibility of discovering a new home for humanity.
