
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork of weary horses and even wearier men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We're bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold secrets older than time itself, but the path is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the desert itself threatens to swallow us whole.  Each sunrise brings the hope of progress, but also the chilling awareness that death could be just a stone's throw away.

Alternatively, imagine the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive, a symphony of controlled chaos propelling us towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Years melt into subjective time as we traverse the inky black, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae and the ever-present glow of our own star, a receding memory.  Our mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess knowledge beyond human comprehension.  The dangers aren't bandits or scorching sun, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself and the alien civilizations – benevolent or otherwise – that might reside within those uncharted star systems.  The reward, however, promises to be as vast as the universe itself.
