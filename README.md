
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, was far from over.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, and the whispers of plague followed like a chilling shadow.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh surge of adrenaline through her, a potent cocktail of fear and determination fueling her onward.  The promise of the Pope's blessing, and perhaps, a new life, kept her pushing against the relentless landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors beyond the Andromeda Galaxy, a task both exhilarating and terrifying.  The vastness of space was a humbling experience, the swirling cosmic dust a breathtaking, yet potentially lethal, tapestry.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the universe, outweighed the risks. The stars beckoned, promising untold wonders to the intrepid explorer.
