
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of sun-drenched lands beyond the mountains.  His quest: to find the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable wealth.  Each creaking cart wheel, each perilous river crossing, each encounter with bandits and unruly lords, chipped away at his resolve, yet the lure of adventure burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising the discovery of a new energy source vital to humanity's survival.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a stark reminder of the perilous journey.  Wormholes, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of void-quakes were just some of the hazards she faced.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to secure the future for her people, fueled her courage and guided her ship through the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
