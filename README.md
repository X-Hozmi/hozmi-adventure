
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the well-trodden path; bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, and whispers of plague stalked the villages. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, river crossings fraught with peril, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, with every sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose spurred her onward, the legendary shrine a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily occurrence.  The loneliness of interstellar travel pressed down, but the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover something new and invaluable, fueled her and her crew as they ventured ever deeper into the cosmic unknown, risking everything for the sake of scientific advancement.
