
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried apples, and the unwavering hope of reaching the fabled city of Ys before winter's grip tightened.  Each creaking cartwheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumour of bandits in the shadowed forests, only fueled her determination to overcome the dangers and uncertainties of this perilous journey across the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, his heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and outsmarting the bureaucratic nightmares of the Galactic Federation were all in a day's work for Razor, but the sheer scale of the cosmos and the mysteries awaiting him on that distant world filled him with a thrill no medieval journey could ever match.
