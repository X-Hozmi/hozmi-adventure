
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, snaked through the dense Ardennes Forest, promising both danger and untold riches.  Rumors of a lost monastery, overflowing with ancient scriptures and forgotten treasures, fueled his relentless journey.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the wolves, bandits, and perhaps even something far more sinister, that lurked in the shadows.  His only companions were his loyal squire and the gnawing hope of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, reassuring thrum against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Ahead lay the unknown – alien landscapes, strange new life forms, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile forces.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for discovery, embraced the challenge, driven by the insatiable human need to push boundaries and explore the cosmos.
