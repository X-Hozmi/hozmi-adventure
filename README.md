
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – seeds of a new life, a new beginning far from the plague-ridden village she fled.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, speaks of potential danger – bandits, starvation, the unknown.  Yet, the promise of a fresh start fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of fear and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', leaps across the void between galaxies. The breathtaking nebulae outside her viewport are a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship’s engines.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The challenges are not bandits and starvation, but treacherous wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any rescue. Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential to reshape galactic civilization, drives her forward, a beacon in the infinite darkness.
