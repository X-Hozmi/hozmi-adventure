
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The muddy track, barely a trail through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless downpour.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city of gold, guarded by mythical beasts and ancient magic.  Each crashing thunderclap felt like a challenge, each gnarled tree a potential foe in this perilous quest for glory and fortune.  He pressed on, spurred by both greed and the intoxicating allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship's warp drive to its absolute limit.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, a rumored haven for advanced alien civilizations and untold riches.  But the cosmos held dangers far greater than any forest beast: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, fueled her determination to succeed in this interstellar expedition.
