
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had transformed the vibrant green of England into a dust-choked expanse.  Each creak of his aging steed was a symphony of hardship, a testament to the miles conquered and the perils still to come.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences in his quest to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of eternal life.  The journey was fraught with danger, but the allure of the unknown spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, yet the vast, unknowable expanse of space held a thrill that matched any medieval knight's quest.  Though her ship boasted advanced technology, the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel demanded courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck – qualities as vital in the 24th century as they were during the age of chivalry.
