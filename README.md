
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air. Her journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward, her spirit as resilient as the weathered stones she passed.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' across the inky expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure safe passage through warring alien territories.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming agents to a newly discovered planet, a world teeming with potential but threatened by interstellar pirates.  The galaxy was vast, unforgiving, and breathtakingly beautiful, a constant reminder of the incredible risks and unparalleled rewards inherent in space exploration.
