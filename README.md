
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he urged the beast onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, the gnawing hunger in his belly. But the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him on, transforming the arduous journey into a pilgrimage of courage and unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystals, vital for jump-drive technology that could bridge the vast gulf between galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars, fueled her relentless pursuit, making the cosmic expanse her personal playground.
