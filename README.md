
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Her small band, a motley collection of mercenaries and pilgrims, pressed onward towards the fabled city of Zara, rumored to hold a powerful relic.  Every creak of their wagons, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, starvation, or the harsh realities of a world where survival demanded courage and cunning.  The endless horizon beckoned, a promise of both riches and ruin, their journey a tapestry woven with the threads of hope and fear.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His crew, a diverse collection of xeno-biologists and mercenary pilots, were on a mission to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable worlds.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger than the medieval plains: rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown, but the lure of discovery was too strong to resist, driving them further into the cosmic frontier.
