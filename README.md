
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the biting wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the Holy City of Jerusalem, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, disease stalked the land, and the very terrain itself threatened to swallow him whole.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim possibility of never seeing another.  Yet, the glint of faith in his eyes burned brighter than the flickering torchlight guiding his path.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unmapped nebulae and search for habitable planets beyond the known Federation.  The vastness of space, a beautiful and terrifying canvas of swirling gas clouds and distant suns, held both wonder and danger.  Navigation glitches threatened to send them spiralling into oblivion, hostile alien encounters were a constant possibility, and the psychological strain of years spent light-years from home tested the crew's resolve. Yet, the pursuit of knowledge, the insatiable human thirst for discovery, fueled their journey across the cosmos.
