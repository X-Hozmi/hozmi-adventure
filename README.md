
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a vital message for the King, a message that could prevent a devastating war.  Robbers lurk in the shadowed forests, and the treacherous mountain passes test both beast and rider to their limits. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for adventure, peril, and the unknown.  Survival itself is a daily quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* leaps across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying world.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the relentless pursuit of a rival empire, Ryla and her crew face cosmic storms and alien encounters that challenge their skills and courage. The vastness of space offers limitless possibilities, but also the chilling certainty that a single miscalculation could mean oblivion for them all.
