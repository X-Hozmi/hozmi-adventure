
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden plains of Aquitaine was a desperate gamble – a pilgrimage to find a legendary healer rumored to reside in the distant mountains.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat, yet the whispered promise of healing fueled her onward, her resolve as hard as the unforgiving earth beneath her boots. Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous rivers, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present shadow of human cruelty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization vanished centuries ago. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump was a gamble, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  But the allure of discovery, the potential for contact with a lost civilization, far outweighed the risk of never returning from the edge of the known universe.
