
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs and a chipped map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog was a potential threat, each sun-drenched valley held the promise of bandits or worse.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of adventure, spurred her onward across the unforgiving landscape, the endless horizon a tapestry woven with hope and peril.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a swathe through the nebula, its hyperdrive a hum against the backdrop of cosmic silence.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  The vast emptiness of space, the breathtaking beauty of swirling galaxies, both filled her with a sense of awe and a thrilling anticipation, a modern-day quest mirroring the age-old human desire to explore the unknown.
