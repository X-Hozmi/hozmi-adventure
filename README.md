
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, a vital artery connecting the warring kingdoms of Eldoria and Aeridor.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message, a fragile peace treaty clutched between parchment and prayer beads.  Each creaking step brought her closer to her destination, but also closer to the lurking dangers of brigands, starved wolves, and the unforgiving elements – a journey as perilous as any dragon's hoard.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve a lost artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, the alien flora and fauna of Kepler a potential death sentence, but the potential rewards—a legendary energy source—outweighed the risks. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to galactic survival.
