
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than supplies; it holds the hope of finding her estranged brother, rumored to be fighting for the King of Aragon.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens her senses, reminding her of the ever-present dangers: bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself. This journey, fraught with peril, is her only recourse, a desperate gamble against the vast, unknown landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport paint a breathtaking canvas, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship’s engines.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that will take generations by conventional means.  But Ryla pilots a vessel equipped with experimental warp drive technology, gambling with spacetime itself to bridge the unimaginable distances, facing the unknown threats of uncharted space with unwavering determination.
