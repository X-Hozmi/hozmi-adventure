
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of disease threatened her journey, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.  She carried not a map, but a whispered prayer and the unwavering strength of her heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver sliver against the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding hostile alien patrols, and wrestling with the unpredictable whims of hyperdrive were just a few of the challenges she faced. But the promise of new life, of untold scientific discoveries, and the thrill of charting the uncharted fuelled her every decision, making the unimaginable distances between worlds shrink under her determined gaze.
