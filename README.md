
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots slapped against the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to harbor both brigands and mythical creatures.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of bread, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between me and the unknown, as I journeyed across the continent to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, following whispers of lost knowledge and untold riches. Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of discovery – and the potential for deadly peril.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  My destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun millions of lightyears from Earth.  The vastness of space, a glittering tapestry of nebulae and distant galaxies, was both breathtaking and humbling.  While the dangers were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remained.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a chance to encounter new species, alien cultures, and landscapes beyond human comprehension.  The cosmos awaited.
