
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, bound for a rumored haven beyond the Black Forest, away from the encroaching plague. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or worse, the sickness itself.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of a new life fueled her onward, a tiny flicker of hope against the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her ship, a nimble freighter capable of traversing the void between galaxies, was her home, a metal cocoon against the infinite expanse.  This run was particularly dangerous; rumors of pirate activity in the Andromeda Galaxy had even the most seasoned spacers on edge.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the reward – a cache of rare crystals on the other side – was worth the risk.  The cosmos held both wonder and danger in equal measure, and Ryla, with her steely gaze and practiced hand on the controls, was ready to face it all.
