
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, trudges across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the threat of disease in stagnant waterholes, and the ever-present uncertainty of finding sustenance in this unforgiving landscape.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, making them seem both closer and impossibly far, mirroring the wavering hope in our hearts as we push towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the dry grass, is a potential harbinger of adventure, or disaster.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a generation ship carrying colonists to Kepler-186f, hums with the quiet efficiency of advanced technology.  Yet, the vastness of interstellar space is a different kind of wilderness.  Micrometeoroid strikes are a constant, low-level threat; the delicate balance of the ship's life support systems a source of constant vigilance. The journey is measured not in leagues, but light-years, and the ever-present darkness outside punctuated only by the distant glimmer of nebulae holds a beauty and terror unknown to medieval travelers.  The adventure lies not just in the destination, but in the endurance required to reach it.
