
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Yet, the thought of her brother spurred her onward, a beacon in the encroaching twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate scavengers was a daily challenge, but the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, and the hope of forging a new life for humanity fueled her journey across the cosmos.
