
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary horse onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire, the distant Alps a hazy promise of respite.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – yet the lure of survival, and perhaps even glory, pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent vastness of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, each star a distant sun, each jump a gamble against unforeseen celestial anomalies or hostile alien encounters.  The future, like the medieval past, was a perilous journey, demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering spirit.
