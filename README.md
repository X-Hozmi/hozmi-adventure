
The year is 2742.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, shuddered as we jumped through a wormhole, the kaleidoscopic swirl of colors a familiar prelude to arriving at a new system.  This time, Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was our destination.  We'd braved pirate attacks in the Andromeda galaxy and navigated treacherous asteroid fields, but the thrill of discovery, the potential for groundbreaking science, kept us pushing onward, risking everything for the unknown.

Xylos proved even more challenging than anticipated.  Its gravity was unpredictable, its atmosphere volatile, and its native life forms…unpleasant. But the breathtaking alien landscapes, the strange flora pulsating with bioluminescence, and the sheer audacity of being so far from home, so profoundly alone in the vast expanse of the cosmos, made every hardship worthwhile. The data we collected promised to revolutionize interstellar travel; the adventure, to forever change our lives.
