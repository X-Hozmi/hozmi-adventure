
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, spurred by the desperate hope that lay beyond the horizon.  The journey was arduous, testing their physical and mental limits, but the allure of Zerzura and the potential to save countless lives fueled their relentless pursuit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded after a catastrophic warp-core failure decades prior.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, dodging asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions, Eva and her crew faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of their medieval counterparts.  Yet, the shared human desire for exploration, for the discovery of new worlds and the forging of new connections, burned just as brightly in their hearts, driving them across the uncharted vastness of the cosmos.
