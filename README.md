
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elara from the clutches of a rogue baron rumored to hold court in the treacherous Black Mire.  Each day brought new challenges – perilous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory and the unwavering belief in their sacred mission propelled them forward, their resolve forged in the crucible of hardship.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the unpredictable cosmic currents.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were mere inconveniences compared to the crippling loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the insatiable human thirst for exploration, the hope of finding the lost colonists, and the sheer awe of the vast, uncharted cosmos fueled her journey, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and courage across the galactic expanse.
