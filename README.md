
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to possess a miraculous healing balm for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the harsh realities of medieval travel tested her spirit and strength with every passing league.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cutting through cosmic dust.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Unlike the medieval journeys of her ancestors, Ryla's travels were guided by sophisticated navigation systems, yet the inherent risks remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders in the black all tested her piloting skills and her courage across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
