The rutted track, barely a path through the whispering woods, offered little comfort, but the thrill of the unknown propelled him forward.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient texts of untold power, fueled his quest. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and excitement.  Bandits, wild beasts, and treacherous terrain were all potential obstacles on his arduous journey across the rugged landscape of Albion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense power and potential danger of interstellar travel.  Cosmic rays danced across her viewport as she navigated asteroid fields and charted unknown star systems, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying in its endless possibilities.
