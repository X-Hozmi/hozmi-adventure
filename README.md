
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest had tested them all – man and beast.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, whispered tales of mythical beasts chilled the night air, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and magic, fueled their relentless pursuit, a beacon in the vast, untamed wilderness. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the bittersweet satisfaction of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a symphony of calculated risks – navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue plasma storms, and constantly monitoring the hyperdrive's volatile energy signature.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known systems, were united by a shared thirst for discovery and the thrill of charting the uncharted.  The promise of a new habitable world, a paradise untouched by interstellar conflict,  made the perilous voyage worthwhile, even as the vast, star-dusted expanse of space stretched endlessly before them.
