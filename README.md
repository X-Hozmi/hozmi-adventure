
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was far from the romanticized tales of troubadours.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the allure of the distant city, a beacon of hope and perhaps salvation, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage light-years from Earth.  The ship shuddered as it navigated asteroid fields and navigated gravitational anomalies, the vast emptiness of space both exhilarating and terrifying.   Alien lifeforms, both beautiful and deadly, were discovered, requiring quick thinking and daring maneuvers.  While advanced technology offered protection, the unpredictable nature of space and the loneliness of interstellar travel presented its own unique set of challenges.  The unknown beckoned, but Eva, like Elara before her, pressed on, driven by the thirst for discovery and a spirit undeterred by danger.
