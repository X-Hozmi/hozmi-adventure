
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the rutted track, her mule struggling under the weight of their meager supplies.  The journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the vibrant hues of bustling market towns, the stark grey of windswept moors, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in shadowed forests. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with unruly peasants, and the constant gnawing fear of disease and starvation. Yet, the promise of Jerusalem, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need for change, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  The journey across light-years wasn't measured in days or weeks, but in the rhythmic hum of the hyperdrive and the endless cycles of cryo-sleep.  The vast emptiness of space, speckled with the glittering promise of uncharted systems, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The true adventure, however, lay not in the technological marvel of interstellar travel, but in the uncertain future awaiting them on a new world, a world full of unknown dangers and endless possibilities.
