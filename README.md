
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and wonder.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on her journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  The promise of a new life fueled her weary legs, pushing her ever onward towards an uncertain horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense canvas of space.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances between planets and galaxies still instilled a sense of awe and loneliness.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the cold, unforgiving void.
