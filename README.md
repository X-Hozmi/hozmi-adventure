
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s splendor, the whispered hope for his sister’s recovery, spurred him on, pushing him further into the unknown heart of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day's work.  But the lure of discovery, the potential to revolutionize interstellar travel, and the hope of finding the lost colonists drove her across the vast expanse of the galaxy, a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the cosmos.
