
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting wind and the constant threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through him.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  The journey was arduous, a constant test of endurance and courage, but the hope of salvation spurred him on.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were constant companions.  Yet, Eva, guided by the star charts and the unwavering belief in humanity's future among the stars, steered her ship onwards, a lone voyager charting a course through the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
