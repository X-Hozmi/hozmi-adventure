
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a half-finished map.  The scent of rosemary and fear mingled in the air – rumors of bandits haunted these lonely tracks, whispers of a lost city promising untold riches just as perilous to find.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, but the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, pushed her onward towards the shimmering horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel, but the breathtaking panorama of alien planets, each a vibrant jewel in the cosmic tapestry, fueled her unwavering spirit.  The mission: to locate a lost colony on the edge of known space, a perilous journey fraught with asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, a testament to humanity's ceaseless quest to explore the vast unknown.
