
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, reminding him of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister, a journey fraught with peril, but one he would undertake for love and family.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, echoing emptiness of space.  Ahead lay not bandits or starvation, but the unknown – alien life, potentially hostile environments, and the ever-present risk of catastrophic system failure.  Yet, the lure of discovery, of charting humanity's future among the stars, fueled her unwavering determination.
