
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to find the legendary Sunstone, a gem said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the risk of bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the unwavering hope of success spurred him and his small band of companions relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The breathtaking colours hid the dangers lurking within: unstable wormholes, pirate fleets, and uncharted celestial bodies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a settlement swallowed by the nebula decades ago.  With her crew relying on her every decision, the vastness of space felt both exhilarating and terrifying, the weight of their potential success – or failure – a constant hum in the cockpit.
