
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.  The rough track was her only map, the stars her only guide in this perilous journey across a war-torn land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the infinite black punctuated by distant nebulae and swirling galaxies.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Xenobiology, astrophysics, and the ever-present threat of space pirates were her constant companions, challenges far removed from the simple dangers of a medieval road, yet equally perilous in their own way.
