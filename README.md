
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whisper on the wind, a jewel hidden in the heart of the untamed forests.  Bandits, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were her constant companions, but the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset the chilling reminder of the dangers that still lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Faster-than-light travel was perilous; jumps through hyperspace were fraught with unpredictable anomalies and the constant threat of pirate raids. Yet, the thought of reuniting with the lost colonists, of piecing together the shattered fragments of their civilization, fueled his courage.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space held both immense danger and the promise of extraordinary discovery.
