
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, the allure of the Sunstone, whispered to possess unimaginable power, spurred him onward, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve.  The path was long, the dangers real, but the thrill of the unknown fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey encompassing light-years and unimaginable celestial wonders.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos both terrified and exhilarated her, a constant reminder of the immensity of space and the smallness, yet importance, of her role in the ongoing expansion of humanity's reach across the galaxy.
