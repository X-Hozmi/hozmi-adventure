
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in the dust of a thousand miles, pressed onward.  The sun beat down on our backs, a relentless foe as unforgiving as the bandits who lurked in the shadowed forests.  Each creak of our wagon wheels, each snort from our tired mounts, marked another step closer to our goal: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings.  We faced perilous mountain passes, treacherous rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the lure of adventure, the whispered promise of untold riches and glory, pushed us forward.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The crimson glow of Kepler-186f bathed the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter* as we jumped through hyperspace, a breathtaking cascade of nebulae swirling past.  Our mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy, a civilization swallowed by the void centuries ago.   Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown; the risk of encountering hostile alien species or navigating treacherous gravitational fields a constant companion. But the quest to uncover the lost colony's fate, to unravel a mystery spanning millennia, fueled our relentless journey across the cosmic sea.
