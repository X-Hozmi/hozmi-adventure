
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the exotic spices rumored to await him in the distant city of Samarkand.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, disease, or worse.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of silks and jewels, spurred him relentlessly across the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The breathtaking cosmic vista, a kaleidoscope of incandescent gas and dust, was a far cry from the muddy tracks of Thomas's journey, but the thrill of discovery burned just as bright within her.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with the dangers of unmapped celestial bodies and unpredictable gravitational forces.  The vastness of space, a daunting and beautiful expanse, stretched before her, a promise of adventure and the unknown.
