
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of shimmering silks and exotic spices in the distant city of Samarkand.  His quest, a perilous journey across war-torn lands to retrieve a stolen relic for his lord, had already tested his mettle.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the obstacles standing between him and his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as Eva navigated asteroid fields and charted unknown systems, her crew a motley collection of explorers and scientists. The thrill of discovery, the danger lurking in uncharted space, and the weight of humanity's future rested on her capable shoulders; this voyage was not just about exploration but about securing a future amongst the stars.
