
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the potential for bandits, disease, or the unforgiving wrath of nature, yet the promise of Constantinople, a city shimmering with gold and legend, fuels our weary steps. The rhythmic thud of horses' hooves and the creak of cart wheels are the soundtrack to our perilous, breathtaking journey across a world both beautiful and brutally indifferent.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaps across the void between galaxies, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Nebulae paint the darkness with vibrant colours, and alien worlds, each with its own unique wonders and dangers, beckon from the distance.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is the constant companion of my solitary journey, a counterpoint to the thrilling solitude and the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown, a journey fueled not by gold and glory, but by the insatiable human hunger for exploration and discovery.
