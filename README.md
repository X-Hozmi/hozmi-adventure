
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I led my small band across the desolate plains of northern France.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with winter rain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Our destination, the fabled city of Constantinople, seemed a lifetime away, a shimmering mirage on the horizon. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of exotic spices and untold riches, spurred us onward, each weary step a testament to our unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our pathways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of colours unseen by any earthly eye.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  We search for the mythical Xylos Crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize worth risking everything for.  The vast emptiness of space holds its own terrors – rogue asteroids, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of mechanical failure – but the promise of discovery outweighs every danger.
