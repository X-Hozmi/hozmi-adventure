
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Canterbury felt endless, each day a tapestry woven with the rough beauty of the English countryside – rolling hills, dense forests whispering secrets, and the occasional flash of steel from a passing knight.  He'd traded stories with grizzled veterans, bartered for food in bustling market towns, and narrowly avoided a band of highwaymen – each encounter etching itself onto his memory, a testament to the adventure unfolding before him.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her journey across the Andromeda galaxy was far removed from Thomas's, yet the thrill of the unknown remained the same.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp drives under the watchful gaze of alien stars, and deciphering cryptic signals from distant civilizations—each challenge pushed her to the limits, rewarding her with a view of the cosmos beyond human comprehension and a profound sense of exploration, echoing the spirit of medieval adventurers centuries past.
