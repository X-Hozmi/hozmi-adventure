The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through a landscape of brooding forests and treacherous mountains.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Yet, the lure of the legendary City of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge, propelled him ever forward, his heart a drum against his ribs, the thrill of the unknown his constant companion.

Her crew, a band of hardened explorers, stood ready, their destiny written in the constellations.
