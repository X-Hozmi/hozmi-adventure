
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely a path, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, each shadow whispering tales of bandits and wild beasts.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Aquitaine, bearing a vital message that could decide the fate of his own. The journey was fraught with peril;  crossing swollen rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages – each day a battle for survival against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was not measured in days, but in months of interstellar transit, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional meteor shower.  More perilous than any earthly beast were the unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirates, ruthless scavengers roaming the black void between stars, ready to claim her precious cargo – the hope of a new beginning for humanity.
