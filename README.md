
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland. Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of Eldoria’s rumored gold, and the hope for salvation, spurred them onward, their journey a perilous tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering resolve.


Centuries hence, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace decades prior.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the psychic storms that threatened to shatter their minds.  But the hope of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of Xylos’s disappearance, fueled her crew, driving them across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos in their desperate search for a lost people.
