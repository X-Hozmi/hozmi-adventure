
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little but dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing fear of the unknown that fuels her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Survival, she knows, depends on her courage and cunning.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through a nebula, its vibrant colours a breathtaking distraction from the gravity-defying maneuvers required to navigate the asteroid field.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The mission, though fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation and unpredictable celestial phenomena, holds the promise of a new home for humanity.  Eva, staring out at the swirling cosmic dust, feels the weight of generations resting on her shoulders, a responsibility as vast and profound as the universe itself.
