
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague haunted every dusty village. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the allure of the unknown pushed her relentlessly forward, a single flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The shimmering nebulae outside his viewport painted a canvas of breathtaking beauty, a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic storms, pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of dimensional rifts made this journey infinitely more challenging than any terrestrial expedition could ever be.  Yet, the promise of a breakthrough for humanity fueled his relentless pursuit across the void.
