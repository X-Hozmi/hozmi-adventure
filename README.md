
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that prickled his skin.  He carried a king's ransom in the saddlebags—a desperate gamble to save his family from ruin—and every creak of the cart, every rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of apprehension through him.  Bandits, starvation, and disease were as real as the sun in the sky, each a potential end to his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gazed out from the bridge of the *Starseeker*, the swirling nebula a breathtaking panorama outside the viewport.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already taken years, a test of both the ship's endurance and her crew's resolve.  But the allure of the unknown, the potential to rewrite the laws of interstellar travel, outweighed the risks.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters were all simply hazards on the path to a greater discovery.
