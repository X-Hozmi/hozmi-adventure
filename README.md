
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meats, a chipped flint knife, and a map older than her grandfather.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present chill of the unforgiving wilderness.  Each step was a gamble, a testament to her unwavering hope and the fierce love driving her onward.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space held wonders beyond imagining, nebulae painted across the cosmos like divine brushstrokes, and celestial phenomena that defied earthly comprehension.  But lurking in the darkness between the stars were dangers far greater than any earthly threat, pirates, rogue AI, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies, making every jump through hyperspace a high-stakes gamble.
