
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in the dust of a thousand miles, trudged onward. The midday sun beat down on our shoulders, the rough terrain a constant challenge to both horse and man.  We’d escaped the clutches of a bandit lord in the north, our meager possessions – a few coins, a battered map, and a shared thirst for adventure – all that remained.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, from treacherous mountain passes to hostile villages;  each sunset, a fleeting moment of rest before the next leg of our perilous journey to the mythical city of Eldoria.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula, a cosmic tapestry of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknown.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sector of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the Xylos system was notorious for its unpredictable wormholes and aggressive K'tharr pirates.   The journey demanded not just courage, but also precise navigation and a reliance on technology far surpassing anything imaginable in the medieval world – yet the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same.
