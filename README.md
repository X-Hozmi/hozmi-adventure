
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered directions from grizzled traders, guided her towards the mythical City of Whispers, a rumored haven said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape, yet the hope of salvation fueled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems were all in a day's work for this seasoned galactic explorer.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the incredible risks and equally incredible rewards that awaited her on this interstellar quest.
