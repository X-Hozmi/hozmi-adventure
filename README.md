
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests a windswept hill, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, promises a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this perilous pilgrimage across the unforgiving landscape, each sunrise bringing a new challenge to her unwavering determination.  The reward, however, might be worth the risk.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck of defiance against the cosmic expanse.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, the unpredictable gravitational pulls of celestial bodies a constant threat to her vessel.  Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate squadrons, and deciphering ancient star charts all pale in comparison to the ultimate challenge – finding a planet lost to time and legend in the infinite ocean of the cosmos.
