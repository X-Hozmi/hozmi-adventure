
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a desperate pilgrimage to a rumored healing spring in the distant Pyrenees mountains, had already claimed more than coin and supplies; it had tested her spirit and resilience against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential danger, yet the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The breathtaking cosmic ballet of colours, a far cry from the mundane greens and browns of Earth, both awed and humbled her.  Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system and search for habitable planets, a journey fraught with the perils of unforeseen gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life forms.  The vast expanse of space offered unparalleled beauty, but it also whispered of terrifying loneliness and the ever-present risk of never seeing home again.
