
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a legend whispered in hushed tones around crackling campfires.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons, and the relentless desert sun threatened to claim her as another victim of its unforgiving heat.  But the lure of discovery, the whispered promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge, spurred her on, a lone figure silhouetted against the vast, indifferent sky.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a motley bunch of xeno-biologists and seasoned navigators, were on the verge of charting a previously unknown galaxy, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace jumps and encounters with sentient species both friendly and hostile.  The thrill of exploration, the chance to uncover the secrets of the cosmos, outweighed the very real risks, fueling their relentless pursuit across the infinite canvas of space.
