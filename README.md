Weeks of relentless travel across the unforgiving terrain had brought his small band of knights to the edge of the Whispering Woods, a place whispered to be haunted by mythical beasts and forgotten magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down his spine, fueling the thrill of the unknown that had driven him from his castle walls.

But the potential rewards - unlocking interstellar exploration for humankind - outweighed the risks.  The cosmos held its breath as the Stardust Drifter plunged deeper into the unknown, a tiny vessel braving the vastness of space.
