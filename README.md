
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  His only companions were a grizzled old knight, a loyal hound, and the ever-present gnawing hunger in his belly.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of Ys fueled his weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily routine, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen anomalies. The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a testament to humanity's boundless ambition.  But the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the colony's fate, propelled her and her crew forward, across the uncharted seas of the cosmos.
