
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a few meager coins, dried bread, and a worn map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or simply the harsh realities of the unforgiving terrain.  Survival itself was an adventure, a constant test of will and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth, rumored to hold untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  His crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, were as diverse as the galaxy itself, each with their own reasons for risking life and limb in the vast emptiness of space.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reminder of the immense distances, and the potential for catastrophic malfunction a constant companion on their audacious quest.
