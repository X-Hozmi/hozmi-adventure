
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their weary mounts trudged through the mud, the stench of rotting vegetation heavy in the air.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, pushing them ever onward toward the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been fraught with peril, the ship battered by cosmic radiation and near misses with rogue asteroids.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony and secure a vital resource that could save humanity from a devastating energy crisis.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace and the alien landscapes of unknown planets was a constant battle against the odds, but the fate of billions rested on her shoulders, driving her across the vast emptiness of space.
