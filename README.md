
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in the form of a smuggled ruby, and her life depended on reaching the coast before the pursuing mercenaries caught her.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the tension of her perilous journey, a race against time and ruthless men.  The medieval world, a tapestry of intrigue and danger, stretched before her, demanding courage and cunning at every turn.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a breathtaking distraction from the looming threat of pirate slavers.  His destination: the Kepler-186f colony, a distant jewel orbiting a red dwarf star.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with perils – unstable wormholes, asteroid fields, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, the promise of untold riches and the thrill of exploration fueled his crew, driving them relentlessly towards the unknown expanse of the cosmos.
