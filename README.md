
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her mule struggling under the weight of their meager supplies.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered to hold ancient magic and untold riches, a beacon in a world shrouded in the superstition and hardship of the Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, or the plague itself – all threats in a journey where survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a wormhole decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own unique dangers – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering new life and forgotten technologies, spurred her onward, her crew a band of explorers facing the vast, breathtaking, and terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
