
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the potential to save countless lives, spurred them forward through the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was commonplace. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, demanded constant vigilance and precise calculations.  The success of the mission rested on her shoulders, the future of a fledgling colony hanging in the balance.
