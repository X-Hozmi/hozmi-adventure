
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching her brother in Avignon.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, with every league covered, the thrill of adventure fueled her onward, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience in the face of medieval hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant hues of distant nebulae painted the cockpit window, a breathtaking contrast to the stark, metallic interior.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and search for habitable planets.  Facing cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unknown dangers of alien worlds, Eva's journey was a different kind of adventure, one demanding scientific precision and unwavering courage in the face of the vast, uncharted cosmos.
