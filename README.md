
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of the desert oasis, fueled his determination, pushing him further into the unknown heartland.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the challenges were no less daunting.  Unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of engine failure tested her crew's skills and courage to their limits. The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable peril, an adventure far beyond any medieval knight's wildest dreams.
