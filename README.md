
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary Isle of Avalon, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just a few obstacles standing between him and his goal.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the allure of the mythical island, whispered of in hushed tones across tavern tables, fueled his unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the ethereal glow of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unmapped nebulae and seek out habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns.  Wormhole instabilities, rogue asteroids, and the chilling silence of the void tested her courage and skill daily.  Yet, the chance to expand humanity's reach, to find a new home among the stars, propelled her forward into the endless expanse.
