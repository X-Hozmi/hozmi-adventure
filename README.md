
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every creak of their saddlebags and each shared loaf of bread, their shared purpose burned brighter.  The whispers of miracles and the promise of redemption fueled them across the unforgiving landscape, a testament to human endurance in the face of medieval hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey taking decades even at near-light speed.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant stars and the hum of her ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and isolating.  But Eva, fueled by scientific curiosity and the weight of humanity's future, navigated asteroid fields, dodged rogue energy storms, and faced the unknown with unwavering courage. The cosmos presented a challenge as epic as any medieval quest, demanding resilience and ingenuity in its own unforgiving way.
