
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her meager pack heavier with each step.  Ahead, the looming Pyrenees mountains promise both shelter and peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her journey to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage fueled by hope and a desperate need to escape a life of servitude.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new landscape to traverse – a tapestry woven with both breathtaking beauty and agonizing hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan pilots her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the cockpit.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling against a deadly plague on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from her home.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of space pirates demands a skill honed by years of experience and an unwavering resolve.  The vast emptiness of space, a silent, breathtaking expanse, holds both the promise of salvation and the terrifying potential for oblivion.
