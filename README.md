
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather boots of Sir Gareth as he urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, a stark contrast to the lush meadows promised in the King's decree.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Jude, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of brigands and mythical beasts filled the night air. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the glint of the gold cross around his neck spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula known as the Serpent's Coil.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the cosmic dust, its hyperdrive humming a low, reassuring thrum.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.   The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with celestial wonders and perilous unknowns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving emptiness between stars.
