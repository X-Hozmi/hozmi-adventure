
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He carried a king's ransom – not in gold, but in seeds, rare herbs, and saplings destined for the royal gardens a thousand leagues away.  His journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every sunrise. Yet, with each sunrise, the promise of distant lands and the challenge of the road fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in subjective time thanks to advanced warp technology.  The vastness of space, teeming with celestial wonders and unknown threats – from rogue asteroids to sentient energy beings – presented dangers far removed from Thomas's, but equally thrilling.  The weight of exploration, the hope of discovery, and the unyielding pull of the unknown propelled Eva and her crew into the heart of cosmic mystery.
