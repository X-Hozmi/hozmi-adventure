
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices, a precarious burden alongside the map promising untold riches in the far east.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the ever-present shadow of the plague.  His journey was a tapestry woven with fear and hope, a desperate gamble for fortune against the brutal backdrop of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering starlight and looming black holes, presented a different kind of danger;  cosmic storms, pirate raiders, and the ever-present threat of engine failure loomed larger than any earthly bandit. But the promise of galactic exploration fueled her journey, a quest for scientific discovery among the silent wonders of the cosmos.
