
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Each step was a battle against the elements – scorching sun, biting winds, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  Their meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, testing their resolve and forging a bond stronger than any forged in the heat of battle.  The road ahead, though uncertain, held the promise of spiritual salvation, a reward worth the countless hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Eva's crew relied on sophisticated technology, navigating by starlight and sub-light engines, but the vastness of space presented its own perils – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien civilizations.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled their tireless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
