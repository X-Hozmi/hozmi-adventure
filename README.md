
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Black Forest was proving far more perilous than he'd anticipated.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent shivers down his spine, while the biting wind and relentless rain threatened to sap his strength completely. Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, said to be hidden in a forgotten monastery beyond the forest, fueled his relentless pursuit, a glimmer of hope amidst the oppressive gloom.  He pressed on, driven by a thirst for adventure and a desperate need to prove his worth.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the potential discovery of a new sentient species, and the technological advancements promised by their lost technology, outweighed the risk.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of untold adventure, a journey far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval knights.
