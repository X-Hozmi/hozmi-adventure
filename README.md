
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey across the treacherous highlands was a test of endurance, each day bringing new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the King, demanded unwavering resolve, a constant struggle against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable nature of medieval travel. The clang of Kaelan's armor was a lonely sound against the vastness of the untamed world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and alien encounters were always a possibility – some friendly, others deadly.  But Elara, with her seasoned crew, pressed onward, fueled by the insatiable human desire to explore the unknown.
