
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the packhorse behind.  Their journey from the besieged city of Avignon was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of courage and endurance, as they pressed towards the distant safety of the royal court, a desperate race against time and the relentless pursuit of their enemies.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with nascent life.  The interstellar journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hyperspace jumps, navigational anomalies, and the constant hum of the ship's powerful engines.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, was a constant companion,  a reminder of the fragility of life and the immense responsibility entrusted to her and her crew.
