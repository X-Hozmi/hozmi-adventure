
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged King across the treacherous, bandit-ridden lands of Aethelred.  Each day brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and evading the watchful eyes of hostile lords.  The journey was a test of endurance, a constant dance between survival and the hope of reaching their destination before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and contending with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps presented a different kind of peril.  Though the challenges were technological rather than physical, the stakes remained high – the fate of humanity, perhaps, resting on the success of her perilous, interstellar voyage.
