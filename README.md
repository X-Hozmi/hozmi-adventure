
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass.  Her small band of mercenaries, a motley crew bound by a shared thirst for gold and glory, press on despite the biting wind and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold treasures beyond imagining, a journey fraught with peril across unforgiving landscapes, perilous rivers, and the ever-watchful eyes of rival mercenary groups.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of their courage and camaraderie.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and perilous asteroid fields.  Advanced technology mitigates some dangers, but the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters remain constant companions.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap into the unknown, a gamble with fate itself.
