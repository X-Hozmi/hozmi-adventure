
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her few belongings, but more importantly, the cryptic map leading to the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the promise of both peril and discovery, a constant reminder that her quest was far from safe, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their hyperspace jump had placed them at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy, a breathtaking vista of cosmic wonders and untold dangers.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across light-years of unforgiving space, navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate fleets, Jax and his crew faced a journey far more perilous than any land-bound adventure, with the vast unknown a constant, terrifying presence.
