**Medieval Era (Travel Across Land)**

The medieval era beckoned with the unknown, its sprawling lands untamed and vast. For many, adventure wasn't a choice but a necessity, whether embarking on a pilgrimage to distant holy sites, a merchant caravan braving trade routes, or a knight answering a king's call across treacherous domains. Each departure from the familiar village gates was a leap of faith into a world defined by ancient forests, formidable mountain ranges, and the boundless horizon, where legends and dangers lay in equal measure.

Such journeys were a crucible of endurance, where dusty trails stretched for weeks, offering only the hospitality of isolated inns or the harsh beauty of the wilderness. Travellers faced the constant threat of banditry, the unpredictable wrath of nature, and the ever-present challenge of navigating without modern maps, relying instead on folklore, faint paths, and the guidance of the stars. Yet, with every hardship came the thrill of discovery: stumbling upon forgotten ruins, witnessing breathtaking landscapes, and encountering diverse peoples whose stories broadened the very fabric of their known world, transforming the weary wanderer into a seasoned voyager.
