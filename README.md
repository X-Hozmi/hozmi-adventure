
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He’d traded his meager farm for a chance at fortune, a whispered rumor of a lost city glittering with gold somewhere beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each day was a gamble against starvation, bandits, and the unpredictable terrain.  The camaraderie of fellow travelers, a shared pot of stew around a crackling fire, were the only comforts against the ever-present threat of the unknown, a constant reminder of the perilous beauty of this medieval quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey of unimaginable distances and potential dangers.  Unlike the tangible threats of the past, her foes were cosmic anomalies, rogue asteroids the size of small moons, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions. Yet, the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration across the vastness of space, fueled her intrepid spirit, a modern echo of the medieval adventurer's relentless pursuit of the unknown.
