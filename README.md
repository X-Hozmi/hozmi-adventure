Her worn map, patched with scraps of parchment, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty of the journey ahead.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation.

The discovery of Xylos’s legendary energy source lay ahead, a prize worth risking everything for.
