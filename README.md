
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing the only map she trusts – a crude sketch drawn by a dying cartographer.  Her quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, a mythical place said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brings new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope for her brother fuels her onward, through sweltering heat and freezing nights, across a landscape both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor'  Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble vessel cutting through the cosmic dust.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Xylos Prime, a world teeming with unknown flora and hostile fauna.  Warp jumps carry him across unimaginable distances, each one a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  The journey is fraught with peril – pirate attacks, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering uncharted anomalies. Yet, the promise of scientific advancement, and a hefty payday, keeps the *Stardust Drifter* and its crew pushing further into the uncaring vastness of the cosmos.
