
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of her journey.  She carried a king's ransom in spices, a secret map promising untold riches, and a heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles standing between her and her destination, a mythical city whispered about in hushed tones.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The swirling colours of the cosmos reflected in her visor as she charted a course towards the uncharted galaxy of Aethel.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, whispered to have mastered a form of faster-than-light travel.  The void between stars held its own dangers, from rogue asteroids to unknown space anomalies, but the promise of discovering a lost civilization fueled her onward, her resolve as unwavering as the starlight guiding her path.
