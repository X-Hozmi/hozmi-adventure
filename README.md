
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate plains.  Her worn leather map, clutched tightly in her hand, is her only guide as she journeys towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the key to curing her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her perilous quest, yet the unwavering hope in her heart fuels her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby as she navigates the swirling nebulae and avoids the treacherous asteroid fields.  Her mission: to establish first contact with a newly discovered sentient species.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, holds countless unknowns, but Ryla, a seasoned explorer, faces the challenges with steely resolve, her spirit as boundless as the cosmos itself.
