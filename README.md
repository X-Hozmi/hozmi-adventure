
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his mule westward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Days bleed into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of Ys, and the thrill of the unknown, spurs him onward, a single flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the Xylos Nebula aboard the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to establish a colony on Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent beauty of nebulae and the occasional flare of a distant supernova, presents a different kind of danger.  Asteroid fields threaten to pulverize her ship, alien lifeforms could lurk in the unexplored systems, and the weight of responsibility for the colonists' survival rests heavy on her shoulders.  Yet, the promise of a new beginning, a new home amongst the stars, fuels her unwavering determination.
