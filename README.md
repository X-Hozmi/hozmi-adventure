
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing a perilous route across the treacherous Black Forest to reach the fabled city of Eldoria.  Rumours of untold riches and powerful magic fuelled his journey, though the constant threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present shadow of starvation tested his resolve at every turn. Each creak of the forest, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised either exhilarating discovery or sudden, violent death.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system was risky, pushing the ship’s aging hyperdrive to its limits.  Ahead lay the promise of new worlds, uncharted planets teeming with alien life and untold resources.  But the dangers were equally vast: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets patrolling the interstellar trade lanes made every journey a gamble with fate.  The universe was a breathtaking tapestry of wonders, but its beauty masked a brutal and unforgiving reality.
