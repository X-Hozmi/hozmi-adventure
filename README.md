
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather jerkin bore the scars of countless scrapes and near misses, a testament to the perilous journey she'd undertaken.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the promise of reaching the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones across taverns, fueled her onward. The glint of distant mountains, hinting at the journey's end, brought a spark of hope to her weary eyes.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unseen planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the volatile K'tharr sector.  The reward?  The legendary Xylos nebula, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a prize worth risking everything for, even if it meant facing down alien pirates and navigating treacherous cosmic currents.  The vast, unknowable universe stretched before her, a canvas of infinite possibilities and unimaginable dangers.
