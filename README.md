
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Her journey across the kingdom was far from easy; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the whispers of a plague stalked her every step. But the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward – a quest to find a legendary healer rumored to reside in a secluded monastery beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains, a perilous journey that promised both danger and salvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a victory hard-earned against the unforgiving landscape and its secrets.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula, the swirling colours a mesmerizing backdrop to the vast emptiness of space. Her mission: to chart a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became commonplace, the constant hum of the ship's engines a lullaby amidst the cosmic ballet.  The challenges were far different from Elara’s, but the spirit of adventure – the thrill of discovery in the face of overwhelming odds – remained unchanged, a human constant across the millennia.
