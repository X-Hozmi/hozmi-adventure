
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and dried provisions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse grasses, speaks of unknown dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, disease clinging to the air, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, hidden deep within the Sahara, fuels her onward, a beacon in the harsh landscape of her adventure.  This journey, fraught with peril, is a test of her courage and resilience, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for exploration.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Wanderer', hurtling through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, she and her crew push the boundaries of human knowledge.  Their quest? To locate the mythical Xylos system, whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond anything currently known.  The vast expanse of space, filled with both wonder and terrifying unknowns, presents a challenge far greater than any medieval knight could imagine; yet, the allure of discovery burns as brightly in Ryla's heart as it did in Elara's.
