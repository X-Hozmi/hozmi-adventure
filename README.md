
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Thomas's boots as he trudged across the parched plains of France.  His meager pack held only dried meat, a waterskin dwindling with each sun-baked mile, and a worn map promising riches – or ruin – in the fabled city of Damascus. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey, a gamble with fate for a chance at fortune and glory. Every sunrise was a new challenge, every sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr pirate fleet, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to reach her goal.  The vast, inky blackness of space was a constant reminder of the perilous journey, but the potential rewards – a technological leap for humanity – made the risks worth facing.
