
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mire.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a daunting barrier on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones as a city of gold and unimaginable wonders, spurred her onward, a beacon in the bleak landscape.  Her worn leather satchel held not only meager supplies, but the hope of a lifetime.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  Navigation across interstellar space was a delicate dance with gravitational pulls and unpredictable asteroid fields.  This journey to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient plant life, was far removed from the medieval struggles of Elara, but the inherent risks remained.  The vast emptiness of space was as terrifying as any medieval wilderness, the potential for catastrophic equipment failure a far more potent threat than any bandit. Yet, the promise of discovery, the thrill of charting unknown territories, propelled her forward across the gulf of stars.
