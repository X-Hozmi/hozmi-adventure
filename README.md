
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara and her caravan struggled onward, their camels laden with silks and spices.  The journey from Samarkand to Constantinople was a perilous one, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: a sudden sandstorm, a confrontation with a rival caravan, or the chilling sight of a nomadic horde on the horizon. Yet, the allure of the fabled city, its riches and the chance to forge her own destiny, fueled their relentless progress across the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his ship a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  He was on a mission to recover a lost artifact, a journey spanning multiple galaxies and demanding navigation through treacherous asteroid fields, black holes, and the hostile territories of alien empires. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the thrill of exploration and the potential rewards far outweighed the risks for this seasoned spacefarer.
