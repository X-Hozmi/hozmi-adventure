
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, spurred his mount onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through a forest haunted by whispered legends of goblins and worse. His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to possess a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled his desperate hope and fear in equal measure, a constant companion on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the light of a binary sunset.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet light-years away, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raiders was all in a day's work, but the vast emptiness of space, the sheer scale of the universe pressing in on her, instilled a different kind of fear—the awe-inspiring terror of the unknown, a constant companion on her voyage across the galaxy.
