
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he rides across the parched plains of Aquitaine, his meager retinue a silhouette against the setting sun.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, whispers of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Ys, the hope of salvation, fuels their weary steps onward, a perilous journey across a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, 'The Icarus', through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a daring expedition to a newly discovered galaxy, charting unmapped star systems and searching for habitable planets.  The vast emptiness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets make every jump a gamble.  But the promise of new worlds, of untold discoveries and resources, keeps the Icarus's engines roaring, a voyage pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
