
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen by spring melt, and past the suspicious glares of feudal lords who controlled each sliver of land.  He faced down brigands, dodged the plague-ridden, and relied on the kindness of strangers as much as his own dwindling supplies, each day a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and bring back vital genetic samples.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers lurking in the void, and battling crippling solar flares were all part of a routine mission, but the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel gnawed at her.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against malfunctioning engines and unforeseen gravitational anomalies, with the fate of an entire species resting on her shoulders.
