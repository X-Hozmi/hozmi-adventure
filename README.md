
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey from York to the Holy Land was a tapestry woven with hardship and unexpected beauty:  dodging bandits in the Black Forest, sharing meager meals with weary pilgrims, and witnessing the breathtaking expanse of the Alps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new encounter, a new vista – a relentless test of her resilience and a constant reminder of the unknown that lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was a daily routine, far removed from the simpler perils of Elara’s era.  Yet the core of adventure remained the same: the thrill of the unknown, the push against boundaries, the camaraderie forged in shared hardship.  The cosmos, vast and indifferent, held the same allure of mystery and promise as the medieval world,  challenging Rexa to explore its furthest reaches, pushing the limits of human ambition against the infinite backdrop of space.
