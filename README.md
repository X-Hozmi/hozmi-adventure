
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or monstrous encounter, a constant reminder of the perilous nature of his journey across the untamed lands.  His only companions were his loyal sword and the unwavering hope that fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost in the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the occasional distant star or swirling cosmic dust cloud, presented a different kind of peril than Sir Kaelan faced.  The threat wasn't bandits or beasts, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the potential malfunction of ancient technology, and the ever-present unknown that lurked beyond the veil of the stars.
