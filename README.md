
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital to her village's survival.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes tested her courage daily, but the thought of her family spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of both peril and the quiet satisfaction of reaching her destination, a monastery rumored to possess the drought-resistant grain she sought.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way. Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of reversing a devastating solar flare threatening her home planet. The thrill of hyperspace travel was eclipsed only by the immense responsibility she carried, navigating not just the cosmos but also the political minefields of interstellar relations. The journey was fraught with dangers, from rogue asteroids to rival factions, but the potential reward – the salvation of her people – fueled her unwavering determination.
