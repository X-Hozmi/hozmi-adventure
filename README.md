Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed passes, and the biting wind promised frostbite.  But the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers encountered along the way, and the unwavering faith in her heart spurred her on, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  The mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.

Yet, the potential discovery of a new world, a civilization unlike any other, fueled her unwavering determination to press on through the cosmic unknown.
