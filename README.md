
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the windswept hill, their worn leather boots leaving barely a trace in the parched earth.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the Holy Roman Empire, a tapestry of sun-baked fields, whispering forests, and treacherous mountain passes.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging their homeland.  Each step was a gamble, fraught with the dangers of bandits, starving wolves, and the unforgiving elements, but the hope of salvation fuelled their weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a survey of potentially habitable planets within the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations.  The ship's AI, HALIX, hummed softly, monitoring the warp drive's stability as they hurtled across unimaginable distances.  While the physical dangers were less immediate – the occasional meteor shower, the ever-present threat of spacetime distortion – the psychological toll of isolation and the vast unknown proved a far greater challenge than any asteroid field.
