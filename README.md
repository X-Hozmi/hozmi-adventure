
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague before I set off, a worn map clutched in my hand.  My journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, promised hardship and uncertainty – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the chance to witness breathtaking landscapes and meet people from far-flung corners of Christendom, outweighed the risks. Each sunrise revealed a new vista, each sunset brought the comforting warmth of a shared campfire and whispered tales under a canopy of stars.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is my constant companion.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star lightyears from Earth.  The risks are different now – radiation, unforeseen celestial events, the sheer isolation of interstellar travel. But the thrill remains.  Gazing out at the swirling nebulae through the viewport, witnessing planets born and die in the vast cosmic canvas, is an experience that dwarfs even the grandest medieval pilgrimage. Each jump to hyperspace is a leap into the unimaginable, a testament to human ambition and our unending quest to explore the infinite.
