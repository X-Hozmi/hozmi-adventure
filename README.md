
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Sernin, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  The journey was fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand was her only guide, a lifeline in a vast and dangerous world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes demanded precision and courage, her crew a motley band united by the shared thrill of exploration and the faint hope of finding survivors.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered unimaginable wonders, but also the constant threat of unforeseen cosmic phenomena and the ever-present danger lurking in the unexplored reaches of the galaxy.
