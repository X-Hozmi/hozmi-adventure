
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a desperate flight from a vengeful baron and a quest to reach the legendary healer in Avignon, was fraught with peril.  Each creaking cart and rustling bush held the potential for bandits, or worse, the baron's relentless pursuit.  The rough terrain tested her strength and resolve, but the hope of healing spurred her on, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Ahead lay the K'tharr system, home to the elusive Xylos crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates tested her piloting skills to their limit.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of untold riches – or utter annihilation.
