
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting beauty.  He dodged bandits in shadowed forests, bartered for meager meals in dusty villages, and slept under a sky ablaze with unfamiliar constellations. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a thrilling gamble against the vast, unknown landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms,  Eva and her crew faced the ultimate test of courage and ingenuity. The breathtaking vistas of distant planets and the sheer scale of the cosmos filled them with a sense of awe, a profound understanding of their insignificance amidst the grand tapestry of the universe.
