
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she navigates the rutted track, her loyal steed, a sturdy grey mare named Lyra, struggling beneath the weight of their meager supplies.  Bandit whispers echo through the windswept plains, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next hill.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown – the whispered legends of the mythical Sunstone hidden in the far north – fuels her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each flash of a hawk overhead, is a testament to the raw, unpredictable beauty of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stares out the viewport of the 'Stardust Drifter', the swirling nebula of Xylos painting the cosmos in vibrant hues. Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the potential for encountering alien civilizations – some friendly, some decidedly not.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant, reassuring counterpoint to the vast, silent expanse of space, a stark contrast to the medieval traveler's reliance on wind and muscle, yet both journeys share the same core: the courageous spirit of exploration pushing the boundaries of the known world.
