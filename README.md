
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the king's decree – a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse, the wild beasts that roamed these lonely mountains.  Survival, not sightseeing, was her sole companion on this arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from the galactic core.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, punctuated by the occasional crackle of subspace comms.  While the dangers weren't of the flesh-and-blood variety, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel presented their own unique challenges.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a breathtaking beauty that far surpassed any earthly vista.
