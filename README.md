
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling taverns and crowded markets left behind.  His quest, to deliver a sacred relic to a besieged monastery far to the north, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across swollen rivers, and into the shadowy forests where rumors of outlaws and mythical beasts held sway. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the bittersweet comfort of a meager fire and hard-won rest.  Survival itself was an adventure, a constant test of courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a kaleidoscope of cosmic gas and dust, hid countless dangers – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a colony struggling on the edge of known space.  Years of rigorous training and countless voyages across the galaxy hadn't dulled the thrill of exploration. Every jump into hyperspace was a leap of faith, every arrival at a new star system a revelation of unimaginable beauty and perilous unknown.
