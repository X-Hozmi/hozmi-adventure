
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Aella, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across babbling brooks swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of the Whispering Woods.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous terrain, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown. Their battered packhorses carried meager supplies, their resolve, however, remained strong, fueled by faith and the thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara, at the helm of the 'Stardust Drifter', navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faint whispers of ancient stellar maps.  The journey between galaxies was a perilous undertaking, fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of Kryll raiders.  Yet, the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a world brimming with untapped resources and alien civilizations, spurred her crew onward. The vastness of space, though terrifying, held the ultimate allure of adventure.
