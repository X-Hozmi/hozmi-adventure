
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World, a formidable mountain range rumored to guard a lost city of gold.  My meager supplies – a waterskin, a half-eaten loaf, and a rusty sword – felt woefully inadequate against the looming peaks and the whispered tales of brigands and mythical beasts. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of fortune and glory, pushed me onward, a lone speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The star-strewn canvas of the galaxy outside my viewport was both breathtaking and terrifying; the vastness of space, the potential for unforeseen dangers, a stark contrast to the relative safety of our advanced starship.  Still, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new life and expand humanity’s reach across the cosmos, fuelled my journey across the unimaginable distances of interstellar space.
