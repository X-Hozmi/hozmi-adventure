
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, urged his weary horse onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a constant companion on his journey to the Holy Land.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to turn their already arduous trek into a deadly one.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a raging river to ford, a treacherous mountain pass to climb, or the wary eyes of a hostile village to contend with.  But the promise of adventure, of glory and perhaps even redemption, fueled his onward march.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue stars was a daily hazard, far removed from the dangers of bandits and blizzards.  Yet, the risks were equally profound.  Cosmic radiation threatened the ship's integrity, and the uncharted territories held unknown dangers, both natural and extraterrestrial.  But the allure of the unknown, the potential for groundbreaking discovery, spurred her onward across the cosmic sea.
