
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's urgent missive, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged castle far to the east.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, whose shadow stretched long across the land.  Her journey was a gamble against fate, a race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, punched a hole through the shimmering veil of a wormhole.  The kaleidoscopic swirl of colours receded, revealing the crimson nebula of Xylos, her destination.  This wasn't a quest for gold or royal decrees; it was a search for a lost colony, swallowed by the vastness of space decades ago.  The risks were cosmic – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of navigational failure in the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy. Yet, Ryla, her crew, and their hope for discovery, pressed onward, their courage a tiny spark against the infinite darkness.
