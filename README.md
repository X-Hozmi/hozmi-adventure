
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day was a battle against the elements and the ever-present threat of bandits, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, propelled me onward.  The creak of my saddle, the whinny of my weary horse, were the soundtrack to my epic quest, a journey etched in sweat, hardship, and the unwavering pursuit of a dream.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, not the wind.  Stars streaked past the viewport as we jumped between galaxies, a vibrant tapestry of nebulas and distant suns painting the darkness. My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Each jump was a gamble, each planet a potential haven or a graveyard of forgotten civilizations.  The vastness of space instilled both awe and a profound sense of loneliness, but the hope of finding my people, the promise of a reunion, fueled my determination to traverse the uncharted cosmos.
