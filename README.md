
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary steed across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalk the land. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising new lands and perhaps, salvation, spurs her onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the terrain, is a testament to her courage, a step closer to her uncertain destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.  The vast expanse of space, peppered with the celestial wonders and dangers of asteroid fields and rogue planets, presents a different kind of challenge.  But Rexx, hardened by years of interstellar travel, relies on his crew's skill and the unwavering hum of the hyperdrive to conquer the cosmic distances and bring them home safely.
