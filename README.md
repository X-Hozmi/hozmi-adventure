
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the relentless sun beating down on his visor.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and arcane power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in his quest for glory and untold wealth.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to press onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the immense distances she was traversing.  Asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction were the dangers she faced, far removed from the medieval knight's concerns, but no less perilous. The vastness of space, a universe teeming with possibilities and unknowns, was her battlefield.
