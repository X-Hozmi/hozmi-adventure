
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms of Europe and into the unknown deserts beyond. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the lure of Zerzura burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding colony.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of swirling cosmic dust clouds were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable riches, a journey far removed from Thomas's muddy tracks, yet echoing his same spirit of daring exploration into the unknown.
