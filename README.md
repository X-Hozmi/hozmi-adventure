
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her and the meager supplies strapped to her pack.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine, was fraught with peril. Whispers of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation fueled her every step.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a jolt of fear through her, yet the unwavering faith in her heart pushed her forward, towards the hope of solace at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter,' a colossal starship traversing the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political minefields she'd had to traverse to secure this mission.  The search for the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace, demanded both courage and cunning.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle of nebulae and distant suns, offered both wonder and the chilling reminder of her isolation in the uncaring immensity of the cosmos.
