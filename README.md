The dust of the King's Road swirled behind him, a testament to weeks spent traversing the unforgiving landscape.  He'd faced bandits in shadowed forests, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated treacherous mountain passes where eagles circled overhead like watchful gods.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory in his quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  The adventure was fraught with peril, but the hope of its reward spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace; the vastness of space held dangers far greater than any earthly foe.  The hum of the hyperdrive and the starlight painting the cockpit were her constant companions on a journey measured not in miles, but light-years – a quest for knowledge that spanned the immeasurable gulf between worlds.
