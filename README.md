
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming dully under the grey sky, urged his weary mount onward.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the secrets of forgotten magic.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  But the lure of Ys, and the whispered promise of power, pushed Gareth and his small band ever closer to their perilous goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming spores to a newly discovered planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, solar flares that threatened to fry their ship's systems, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on interstellar traders.  But the chance to make a world habitable, to leave a legacy that spanned the galaxy, fuelled her courage and propelled her across the vast expanse of space.
