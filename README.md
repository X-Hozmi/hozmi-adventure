
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from York to Canterbury felt endless, each day a tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that clawed at his belly.  Yet, with every sunrise painting the sky in vibrant hues, a thrill coursed through him.  He carried a king's pardon, a lifeline to a new life, and the unpredictable road ahead held a promise of freedom and unknown adventures.  Each village encountered, each river forded, each whispered tale shared around a crackling fire added another vibrant thread to his epic tale.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled Captain Eva Rostova's ears as she navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with perils far exceeding those faced by medieval travelers.  While bandits were replaced by rogue space pirates, and mud by asteroid fields, the core of the adventure remained the same—the intoxicating thrill of the unknown, the pulse of discovery, and the unwavering hope of finding something extraordinary beyond the familiar.
