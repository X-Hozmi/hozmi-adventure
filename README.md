
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a landscape both breathtaking and perilous.  Bandit whispers echoed from shadowed forests, and the promise of a mythical city of gold fueled her desperate journey across the kingdoms, dodging patrols and bartering for supplies in smoke-filled taverns.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent light.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the vast gulf between Andromeda and the Milky Way, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and pirate raids that plagued hyperspace.  The prize? A legendary nebula rumored to contain a substance capable of warping space-time itself – a prize worth risking everything for.
