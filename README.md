
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a chipped map, her only companions the relentless sun and the ever-present fear of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, from treacherous mountain passes to the suspicion of unfamiliar villages, yet the hope of reaching her sister in Avignon fueled her onward.  This journey, a perilous tapestry woven with hardship and uncertainty, was her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ryx" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the endless expanse of space, yet the unknown dangers lurked – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets prowling the black.  This was no mere voyage; it was a quest to find a new home for humanity, an intergalactic odyssey fueled by courage and the boundless curiosity of the human spirit.
