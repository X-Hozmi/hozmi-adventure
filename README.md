
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst travelers, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey, but the lure of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, pushed her ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of swirling gas and cosmic radiation, presented a different kind of challenge.  Instead of bandits, she faced rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational pulls.  Instead of starvation, it was the relentless pressure of interstellar travel, the isolation, and the constant threat of system failures.  Yet, the promise of discovering new civilizations, charting unmapped territories amongst the stars, fueled her ambition, a modern-day equivalent to the medieval quest for Eldoria, but on a scale far grander and more perilous.
