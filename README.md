
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a waterskin, and a worn map – her only guides across the treacherous lands separating her from the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unpredictable weather a greater one, but the whisper of ancient magic within Ys's walls fueled her every step, a burning ember against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow reflecting in the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already tested their ship's resilience against cosmic storms and gravitational anomalies.  But the lure of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting the unmapped expanse of the universe, outweighed the risks, a siren song echoing in the vast, star-dusted silence.
