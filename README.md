
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched Breton countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and fear heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a treasure in itself, promised a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog, each fleeting glimpse of a hooded figure in the distance, fueled the growing tension of her perilous journey.  Bandit raids were commonplace, and the whispers of a vengeful sorcerer haunted her every step, a threat as tangible as the sun beating down on her neck.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a gamble, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the capricious gravitational pulls of dying stars.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, and the ever-present hum of the ship's engines was a constant reminder of their isolation in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space. The thrill of discovery was matched only by the ever-present risk of cosmic annihilation.
