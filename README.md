
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, but the allure of the unknown fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of discovery and each sunset a testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate raids were daily concerns, but the breathtaking vistas of swirling cosmic dust and distant, uncharted planets kept her crew motivated.  The search for the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, pushed them beyond the known boundaries of space, a testament to human ambition in the face of the infinite.
