
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary destrier onward.  The biting wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape of the Scottish Highlands, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind in France months ago.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a journey fraught with peril, demanding he navigate treacherous mountain passes, evade ruthless bandits, and outwit cunning lords.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a prayer for survival.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to the uncharted Kepler-186f system, in search of a rare energy source vital to the survival of her people.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and deciphering cryptic alien signals tested her skills to their limits.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a different kind of challenge than any medieval knight could ever imagine; the ultimate test of courage and ingenuity light years from home.
