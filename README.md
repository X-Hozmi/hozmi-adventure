
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara and her small band of travelers pressed onward.  Their battered wagon, laden with spices and silks pilfered from a Sultan's caravan (a daring raid Elara still blushed to recall), creaked and groaned under the weight.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred them onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Navigating the treacherous Kepler-186f system, she dodged rogue asteroids and dodged the gravitational pull of gas giants, her seasoned crew a tight-knit family bound by the thrill of exploration and the allure of the unknown. Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions beyond the known galaxy, searching for habitable planets and relics of long-lost civilizations.  The risks were immense, the rewards potentially limitless.
