
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far less daunting than the rumored dragon guarding the lost city of Eldoria – the reason for her perilous journey.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the adventure, a constant dance between hope and fear under the vast, indifferent sky.  The journey itself, with its hardships and encounters, was as much a part of the legend as the city itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust swirling around her vessel.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant shimmer of galaxies, was a breathtaking and terrifying backdrop to their quest.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each alien encounter a potential ally or enemy.  The galaxy itself was a vast, unpredictable wilderness, and the adventure lay not just in reaching Xylos, but in surviving the journey.
