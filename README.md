
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains. Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the desperate hope it represented, fueled her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Prime, scattered across the uncharted sectors after a catastrophic warp-storm.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and hostile alien encounters.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, but the potential reunion with lost colonists, and the thrill of exploration, propelled her across the galaxy.
