
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin stained with the mud of a thousand miles, urged his weary mount onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promised both peril and, perhaps, the fabled city of Eldoria, its streets paved with gold and guarded by mythical creatures.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – a mixture of fear and the exhilarating thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, starvation, and treacherous terrain were but minor inconveniences in his quest for glory and fortune.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a similar blend of apprehension and excitement.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, the navigation charts incomplete, but the potential reward – a new source of hyperium, the fuel that powered interstellar travel – was too tempting to resist.  Her crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, watched with bated breath as the ship warped into the unknown, the vastness of space both terrifying and incredibly beautiful.
