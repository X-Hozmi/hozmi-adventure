
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats and a chipped map, her compass a wavering guide across the uncharted wilderness.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of the fabled Sunstone city spurred her onward, a beacon of hope in a world steeped in hardship and mystery.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*, his knuckles white against the shimmering control panel.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, throwing the small crew against their restraints. Ahead lay an unmapped planet, a jewel in the vast expanse of the Cygnus X-1 galaxy.  The risks were staggering: unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failures in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the promise of discovering a new habitable world, a new home for humanity, was a reward worth risking everything for.
