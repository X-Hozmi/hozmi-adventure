
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear. He was bound for the fabled city of Sarai, a journey fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring melt, and the whispers of plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, a new encounter with the unpredictable beauty and brutal reality of medieval travel.  The road was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a path paved with both despair and the thrilling promise of distant riches.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and repairing critical systems under the relentless gaze of distant suns were all part of a galactic trader's life.  The journey wasn't just about reaching a destination; it was about pushing the boundaries of human exploration, facing the unknown with courage, and reaping the rewards – or facing the consequences – of venturing where few had dared to go before.
