
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armour gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track through the unforgiving landscape, wound its way towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of strange beasts in the whispering canyons kept his hand perpetually near his sword hilt.  Each day brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for scarce supplies in isolated villages.  His quest, fuelled by rumour and ancient prophecies, promised both unimaginable riches and perilous encounters.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with its own perils – unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields that demanded nimble piloting, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels preying on unsuspecting transports.  The vast distances and the alien landscapes held a different kind of danger than Sir Gareth faced, but the thrill of exploration, the push towards the unknown, was a timeless human impulse, burning as brightly in the hearts of galactic pioneers as it did in those of medieval knights.
