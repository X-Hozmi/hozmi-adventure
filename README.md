
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sprawling, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay Lyon, a whispered rumour of a merchant caravan offering passage to the Holy Land, a journey fraught with bandits, harsh winters, and the ever-present threat of plague. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of spice-laden markets and tales whispered around crackling fires, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the vibrant nebula outside his starship window shimmering with dangerous beauty.  Navigation charts blazed across the holographic display, plotting a course through the treacherous Xylos asteroid field – a necessary evil to reach the fabled Kepler-186f. This mission, a perilous search for a new habitable world, held the fate of the human race on its shoulders.  The dangers weren't limited to celestial bodies; rival corporations and warring alien factions lurked in the shadows of unexplored space. But for Rexx, the boundless expanse of the cosmos offered not fear, but an irresistible call to adventure.
