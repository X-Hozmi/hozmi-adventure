
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest had been relentless; bandits, treacherous paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested him and his small band. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, with its promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, pushed them relentlessly forward. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril, but also the thrill of the unknown.  This was more than a journey; it was a pilgrimage into the heart of legend.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian artifact, a device whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr patrol ships, Eva and her crew faced cosmic perils far beyond anything their medieval predecessors could have imagined.  The vastness of space offered awe-inspiring beauty, yet held a constant undercurrent of danger; a single miscalculation could mean the end of their journey, and their lives.
