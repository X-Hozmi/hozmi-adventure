
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with each crest climbed, each river forded, her heart swelled with the thrill of the unknown.  The whispers of Saragossa's hidden knowledge, the legends of its ancient libraries, spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled her crew's courage, a modern-day quest for the new world echoing the spirit of countless medieval adventurers before them.
