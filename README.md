
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – seeds of a new life for her village, promised in the fabled Sunken Valley beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse pines, held the thrill of the unknown, the risk of bandits and starvation ever-present companions on her perilous journey.  Survival, and the hope of a bountiful harvest, fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its crimson hues a breathtaking backdrop to the hum of the hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  While the dangers of asteroid fields and pirate fleets were a constant threat, Eva's fear was less of physical harm and more of the unknown, the vastness of space amplifying the loneliness of her quest.  Yet, the possibility of finding life beyond Earth, of securing a future for humanity, burned brighter than any star.
