
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of the distant, snow-capped peaks spurred him onward, a beacon of hope amidst the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate incursions were everyday occurrences, a far cry from the dusty trails of Reginald's era.  Yet, the sense of adventure remained – the uncharted territories, the breathtaking vistas of alien planets, and the thrill of discovery fuelled her journey across the cosmic ocean, a pilgrimage to a new world teeming with both wonder and unknown dangers.
