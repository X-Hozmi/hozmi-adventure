
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns – tales of faraway lands brimming with silks and spices.  Each creak of the mule's harness, each rise and fall of the landscape, represented another step towards the unknown, a gamble against bandits, famine, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  His quest, a simple pilgrimage to a distant shrine, had transformed into a crucible of endurance, testing his spirit and resolve with every league traversed.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising potential life.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Unlike the medieval journeys of her ancestors, Eva's challenge wasn't just physical; it was a battle against time, technological failures, and the ever-present threat of the uncharted.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite unknown, but the allure of discovery burned brighter than any fear.
