
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the ochre hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid from a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Her journey was a gamble, a perilous adventure dictated by survival and unwavering faith.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Riley steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  His destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The risks were astronomical – unpredictable wormholes, pirate fleets lurking in the shadows of forgotten star systems, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  But the potential reward, a technological leap that could change the fate of humanity, spurred him onward through the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
