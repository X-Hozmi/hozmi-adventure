
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a brittle scroll detailing the rumored location of a lost monastery, said to hold ancient healing secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land were almost as palpable as the heat.  Her journey was fraught with danger, but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the quest, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike any encountered before.   The jump to hyperspace was a heart-stopping plunge into the unknown, a gamble with the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.  While the dangers were far removed from bandits and disease, the threat of rogue asteroids, solar flares, and hostile alien encounters were just as real, demanding the same courage, resilience, and unwavering determination as any medieval quest.
