
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was proving far more arduous than anticipated. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving landscapes, and the constant vigilance required to survive in a world where the only constant was hardship.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the whispered promise of salvation at the shrine's altar, propelled them forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates was routine, but the vast distances and cosmic unknowns held a different kind of peril.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Kaelan's journey, Elara faced the lonely vastness of space, the potential for catastrophic equipment failure, and the ever-present fear of the unknown lurking within the uncharted sectors of the galaxy.  The reward, however, was the same – the hope of providing aid and perhaps, discovering something incredible along the way.
