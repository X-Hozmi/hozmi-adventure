The rutted track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in smoky taverns – a city of unimaginable riches, guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.

The hum of the hyperdrive promised a journey beyond the wildest dreams of medieval knights.
