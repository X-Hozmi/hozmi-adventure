
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, from navigating unfamiliar rivers to bartering for meager supplies in dust-choked villages. Yet, the lure of the sacred city, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the ever-shifting landscape fueled their relentless advance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vast distances were measured not in leagues, but in light-years, traversed not by horse and foot, but by warp drive.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remained the same. The uncharted cosmos beckoned, promising discovery and a test of courage that spanned the immensity of space itself.
