
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered directions, was her only guide across the treacherous lands separating her village from the rumored City of Whispers.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving elements, but the promise of untold riches and forgotten magic fueled her relentless journey.  The creak of her saddlebags, filled with meager supplies and unwavering hope, was the soundtrack to her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was a treacherous dance through asteroid fields and the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, each jump a gamble against the crushing void.  The ship's AI, a sardonic program named Glitch, was his only companion, their banter a stark contrast to the awe-inspiring beauty and existential terror of the cosmos. The galaxy was his playground, but the stakes were infinitely higher.
