
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispers of legend, spurred him onward, pushing him beyond the limits of his endurance.  Every sunrise held the promise of discovery, every sunset the weight of survival.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory Zydonian cruisers, she relied on her wits and the cutting-edge technology of her ship.  The vast emptiness of space was a daunting canvas, but the potential for discovery, the hope of finding survivors, fueled her journey across the galaxy, a voyage that dwarfed even the grandest medieval expeditions in scale and danger.
