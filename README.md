
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, undulating plains a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, fear, and the unwavering determination of a man battling against impossible odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The vast distances between stars were measured not in days, but in years, the constant hum of the hyperdrive a lullaby against the terrifying loneliness of space.  Each jump into hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the reward – the potential for a new beginning – outweighed the risks.
