
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and power.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that stalked them relentlessly.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the legend and the promise of glory, while the setting sun painted the sky with hues mirroring both hope and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory spacefaring creatures of the Xylos system was a daily challenge.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and the chilling uncertainty of what awaited them on the other side of the galaxy – a forgotten colony, or something far more sinister.
