
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the fading hope of reaching his destination before succumbing to the elements or the dangers that lurked in the shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with the risk of encountering uncharted black holes and hostile alien patrols.  The vastness of space was a breathtaking and terrifying spectacle, a cosmic ocean teeming with wonders and dangers beyond human comprehension.  The success of her mission – and the survival of her crew – hinged on her navigational skills and their ability to overcome the unpredictable forces of the universe.
