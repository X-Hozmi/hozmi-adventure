
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind the creaking wheels of my cart as I traverse the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping my cloak around me like a frantic bird.  Each rocky outcrop holds the potential for bandits, each shadowed valley whispers of lurking beasts.  My destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, lies beyond this unforgiving landscape, a prize worth risking everything for – rumored silks, exotic spices, and tales yet untold.  The journey is as much the adventure as the destination, a constant test of endurance and wit.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is my constant companion, a deep thrum that vibrates through my bones as we jump between galaxies.  Nebulae blaze past like cosmic brushstrokes, their colours both terrifying and breathtaking.  My mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity. The dangers are different now - rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the unknown alien life that might lurk on these distant worlds.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the vastness of space, echoes the spirit of those medieval adventurers, risking everything for a glimpse beyond the known.
