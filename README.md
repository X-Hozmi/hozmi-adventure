
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden highlands had already claimed two of his companions, and supplies were dwindling.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, and each sunset the chilling promise of a freezing night under a vast, indifferent sky. Yet, the whispers of El Dorado, a city of unimaginable riches hidden deep within the unexplored mountains, fueled his relentless pursuit; a desperate gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the ever-present shadow of death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints, but they were finally within range of Kepler-186f, their target.  This seemingly unremarkable planet, light-years from Earth, held the key to solving the great energy crisis – a new source of power that could reshape the galaxy. But the journey was far from over; rumours of hostile alien lifeforms and treacherous asteroid fields still lay ahead, testing the limits of both their technology and their courage.
