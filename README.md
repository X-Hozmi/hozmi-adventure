
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept hill, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a poor substitute for the familiar tang of the sea.  Her journey from the coast to the King's court in Avignon has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the promise of delivering the vital message, a chance to prove her worth beyond her humble beginnings, fuels her onward.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand is her only guide, a testament to the courage and resilience required to traverse the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around his starship.  His mission: to deliver a shipment of rare Xylossian crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that will test the limits of both his vessel and his crew.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Rexx faces dangers far beyond bandits and disease – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos and the thrill of charting unknown territories provide a powerful counterpoint to the risk, driving him and his crew further into the uncharted expanse.
