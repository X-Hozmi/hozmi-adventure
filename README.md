
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones, said to hold untold riches and unimaginable magic.  Each creak of saddle leather, each clang of his sword against his thigh, was a reminder of the perils – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – that lay between him and his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her heart pounding in rhythm with the hyperdrive's hum.  Across the swirling nebula, a distant sun pulsed, marking the coordinates of Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravity wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels lurking in the shadows of unexplored space. But the promise of unlocking the universe’s greatest secret fueled her unwavering determination, pushing her and her crew toward the unknown.
