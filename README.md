
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable weather threatened to bury her alive in snow. Yet, with each sunrise, a fierce determination burned within her, fueled by faith and the tantalizing whisper of adventure that lay hidden in every twisting mountain path and unfamiliar village.  She carried more than just a staff and a knapsack; she carried the weight of hope, and the immeasurable reward of reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent gases a breathtaking backdrop to the daunting task ahead.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was child’s play compared to the unknown dangers that awaited them on the planet's surface.  The galaxy was vast, unforgiving, and teeming with wonders – and horrors – beyond human comprehension.  But for Nova, the thrill of exploration outweighed the risk, her heart pounding with the intoxicating rhythm of interstellar travel.
