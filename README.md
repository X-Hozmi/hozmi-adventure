
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown brush, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  The journey is fraught with peril – treacherous mountain passes, hungry wolves, and the ever-present threat of disease – yet the unwavering hope for her brother fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae painted across her viewport are a breathtaking but familiar sight; years spent charting unexplored sectors have instilled both wonder and a healthy respect for the unknown.  Her current mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous journey through uncharted wormholes and potentially hostile alien territories.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the lure of the undiscovered fuel her relentless pursuit.
