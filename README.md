
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the muddied track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, winding rivers to cross, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the glory awaiting its discoverer, spurred them onwards.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet teeming with a rare and precious element vital to galactic survival.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms was a constant battle against the vastness and unpredictability of space.  But the potential rewards, and the knowledge that her discovery could save countless lives, fueled her unwavering determination to reach Xylos, no matter the cost.
