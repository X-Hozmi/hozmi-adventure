
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the unknown – a rumored city of gold whispered about in taverns, a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and across unforgiving mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, danger, and perhaps, unimaginable riches.  The scent of pine and woodsmoke mingled with the ever-present tang of fear and anticipation, a potent brew for a medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking, yet treacherous, spectacle.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable void between galaxies.  But the potential rewards – unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, charting new worlds – far outweighed the risks for a galactic explorer like Rexa, whose heart beat in time with the hum of her ship's engines.
