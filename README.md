
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  The sun beats down mercilessly, baking the earth to a brick-hard crust.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or disease, but the lure of the fabled Silk Road, promising riches beyond imagining in the distant East, keeps us moving.  We trade whispered stories around crackling fires at night – tales of monstrous beasts, lost cities, and the wonders awaiting those brave enough to reach the end of the trail.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel capable of faster-than-light travel, cuts through the inky void between galaxies.  Our mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate humanity facing resource depletion on Earth.  The vastness of space holds wonders beyond comprehension – nebulae painted across the cosmos, alien landscapes teeming with unknown life (or the terrifying lack thereof), and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields or rogue black holes. Yet, the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning, fuels our journey across the uncharted expanse.
