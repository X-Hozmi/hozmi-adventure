
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis whispered about in taverns and sung by wandering minstrels.  His journey was fraught with peril: brigands lurked in the shadowed forests,  deserts stretched for days under a merciless sun, and the whispers of ancient, vengeful spirits haunted the crumbling ruins he passed.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a perilous one, a voyage across light years punctuated by asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  But the allure of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and potentially, new life, far outweighed the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace held the possibility of breathtaking wonders, or catastrophic failure – a gamble Eva was willing to take.
