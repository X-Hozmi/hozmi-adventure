
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Woods, notorious for bandits and worse, but the rumored healing spring at its heart offered her only hope for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a potent mix of fear and fierce determination fueling her onward.  The journey was arduous, the landscape unforgiving, but the promise of salvation spurred her on through days of relentless sun and nights of chilling frost.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her multi-generational crew, descendants of colonists scattered across the galaxy, were bound for the uncharted Kepler-186f, seeking a new home amongst the stars.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was a daily occurrence, the vast, unknowable expanse of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  The journey, measured in light years rather than miles, was a testament to human resilience and the relentless pursuit of a better tomorrow, a future written in the constellations themselves.
