
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, pressed onward through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of our exhausted mounts punctuated the silence, broken only by the occasional rustle of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.  Our destination: the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and guarded by ancient magic.  The path ahead remained shrouded in uncertainty, a tapestry woven with peril and the faint hope of legendary reward.  Robbers, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on our arduous journey across the known world.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a generation ship humming with the quiet thrum of fusion engines, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova, her face etched with the weariness of interstellar travel, charted a course towards the Kepler-186f system, a beacon of hope in the vast emptiness.  Her crew, a diverse tapestry of humanity's future, dreamt of discovering a new Eden, a world ripe for colonization.  But the vast distances and the unpredictable nature of the cosmos posed constant threats,  from rogue asteroids to the chilling possibility of encountering alien life, both benevolent and hostile.
