
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering collection of pack animals and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts.  We're bound for the mythical city of Samarkand, whispered to hold secrets older than time itself – secrets guarded by treacherous mountain passes, warring tribes, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of apprehension, yet the allure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and legendary artifacts, pushes us onward, one agonizing step at a time.

Five centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, our generation starship, hums with controlled power as it navigates the swirling nebula of the Andromeda Galaxy.  We are explorers, charting unmapped regions, probing the mysteries of distant planets.  Alien landscapes unfold before us – crimson deserts under twin suns, ice-covered moons orbiting gas giants, vibrant jungle worlds teeming with life both familiar and utterly bizarre. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast emptiness of the cosmos, but the potential for discovery, for understanding our place in the universe, makes the risk worthwhile.
