
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small band of travelers pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed several pack animals and tested their resilience against bandits, storms, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, murky forests haunted by whispers of mythical beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of Eldoria, a city said to hold the secrets of immortality, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess an energy source capable of bridging galactic distances. Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing warp core breaches were all commonplace hazards on their interstellar voyage.  The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, held a chilling indifference, and the fate of the Kepler colony remained shrouded in mystery, a constant pressure weighing on the crew as they pushed towards the unknown.
