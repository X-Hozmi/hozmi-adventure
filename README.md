
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth, the only respite the occasional shade of a gnarled olive tree.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the hope that burned within her, fueling each labored step across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of determination, each sunset a renewed prayer for safe passage.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring exploration of the newly discovered Andromeda galaxy, charting unexplored sectors and searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held endless possibilities and equally endless perils.  Warp jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the constant threat of system malfunctions kept her crew on edge.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, pushed them onwards, each star a beacon guiding them through the cosmic ocean.
