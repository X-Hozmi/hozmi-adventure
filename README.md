
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the untamed forests of Arden, rumored to hold both untold riches and terrifying beasts. Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the very rivers seemed to whisper of treacherous currents and lurking water sprites.  Yet, the promise of adventure, of discovering forgotten magic and forging her own destiny, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the crimson nebula swirling outside the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their hyperspace jump to Xylos had gone sideways, depositing them light-years off course and deep within uncharted territory.  Pirates, alien infestations, and rogue black holes were just some of the threats they faced.  But Rexx, with his seasoned crew and their battered freighter,  had faced worse.  The lure of untold riches hidden within Xylos’s derelict space stations was a siren song too strong to resist, and the thrill of the unknown – of facing the galaxy’s unforgiving expanse – was the ultimate reward.
