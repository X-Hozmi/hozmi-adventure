
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone Shrine, had already claimed several pack animals and tested their resolve against bandits, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger of the endless steppe.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and constantly vigilant against the ever-present threat of wild beasts and brigands.  The allure of the shrine, however, fueled their relentless march toward the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, however, dwarfed even the most formidable challenges.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, but the potential rewards – the advancement of interstellar medicine and humanity's reach across the cosmos – made it all worthwhile.
