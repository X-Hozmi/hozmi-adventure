
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving wilderness, leading him towards the mythical city of Eldoria. Rumors spoke of untold riches and powerful magic, but the journey was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows, treacherous terrain threatened to break bones and claim his life, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion. Yet, with each weary mile, the thrill of the unknown spurred him onward, the promise of adventure a potent antidote to fear.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation was a constant challenge, asteroid fields a deadly threat, and the loneliness of interstellar travel a relentless pressure. But Eva, hardened by years of exploration, pressed on, her heart filled with a boundless curiosity and the unshakeable conviction that the universe held secrets worth risking everything to uncover.
