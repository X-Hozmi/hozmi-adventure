
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the promise of a potentially perilous night under the vast, indifferent stars.  The journey was arduous, but the spirit of adventure burned brighter than any campfire.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against the unforgiving void of space.  Warp jumps were perilous, alien encounters unpredictable, and the ship's ancient systems groaned under the strain of interstellar travel.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the hope of finding survivors fueled her unwavering determination.  The universe offered boundless adventure, but only for the brave.
