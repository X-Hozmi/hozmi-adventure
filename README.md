
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword heavy with the weight of recent battles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless rain.  His quest: to reach the distant abbey of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland. Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, or worse – adding to the perilous nature of his journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by the encroaching tendrils of a rogue black hole.  Navigation was treacherous, relying on archaic star charts and her own instincts honed through years of interstellar exploration.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, teeming with unpredictable celestial phenomena and potential alien encounters, represented a different but equally daunting adventure, a voyage far removed from the muddy tracks of medieval Europe, but no less thrilling.
