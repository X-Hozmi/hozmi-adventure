
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind whipping her cloak around her.  Her small caravan, a motley collection of merchants and pilgrims, creeps along the narrow path, the rhythmic clang of their mule bells a counterpoint to the hawk's cry overhead.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, drive them onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain. Each sunrise brings a fresh test of courage and resilience, a testament to the human spirit's enduring quest for the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his ship a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, but the journey is fraught with peril.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make every light-year a gamble.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, charting unmapped galaxies, and forging a future amongst the stars fuels his relentless drive, a modern echo of those medieval adventurers who dared to journey into the unknown.
