
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her family's hopes.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for banditry or worse – the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the fabled spice markets of Alexandria, whispered of in hushed tones in her village, spurred her onward. The journey was arduous, a tapestry woven with the kindness of strangers, the sting of hunger, and the breathtaking beauty of a landscape both unforgiving and magnificent.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate ambushes.  The vastness of the cosmos, a tapestry of swirling gases and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f. The risks were immense, but the reward – the potential to save lives light-years away – made the journey worth every cosmic tremor.
