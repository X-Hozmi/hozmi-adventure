
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track snaked through a sun-baked landscape, the Pyrenees Mountains looming like jagged teeth against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death whispering on the wind.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating dense forests, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages – but the lure of the holy relic and the glory it promised kept his weary spirit alight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a spacetime anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were commonplace hazards.  But the true danger lay in the unknown, in the potential for encountering alien lifeforms – benevolent or otherwise – across the vast gulf of interstellar space.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the haunting whispers of the lost colony propelled her forward on this impossible journey.
