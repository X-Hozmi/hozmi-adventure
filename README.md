
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside, the scent of rosemary and woodsmoke a thin veil against the stench of impending war.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and herbs; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a ravaged village and the promise of sanctuary in the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the tall grasses, held the thrill and terror of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the next sun-drenched hill.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as they jumped between galaxies, the cosmos a breathtaking canvas of nebulas and distant starlight.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a colony struggling on the edge of known space. The risks were immense – pirate raids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena. But the call of the unexplored, the thrill of pushing humanity’s boundaries, fueled her unwavering resolve.
