
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliff faces, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled my journey across the vast, unpredictable landscape of Europe, a quest for rumored riches and the glory of reaching the distant city of Constantinople. The camaraderie of fellow travelers, forged in the fires of shared hardship, was a treasure more valuable than any gold.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we hurtled between star systems.  The breathtaking panorama of nebulae, vibrant and alien, unfolded outside our viewport. Our mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable worlds amongst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.  The risks were far greater than any medieval band of robbers – gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of ship malfunction. But the promise of discovery, the potential to unravel the mysteries of the universe, spurred us on through the black void, each jump a leap into the extraordinary.
