
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a king's decree – a dangerous mission to deliver a vital message to a distant lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with fear and determination, every sunrise a gamble, every nightfall a prayer.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, his knuckles white against the polished chrome.  The jump coordinates were set; their freighter, *Stardust Drifter*, was poised to breach the wormhole, leaping across galaxies to a newly discovered planet teeming with Xylos – a rare element vital to sustaining life on the sprawling, overcrowded Neo-Alexandria.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroid fields, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the thrill of the unknown, the lure of discovery, burned just as brightly as it had in Elara's time.
