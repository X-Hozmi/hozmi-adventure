
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold a cure for her brother's illness.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of reaching Samarkand fueled her onward, a flicker of defiance against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Starfire" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his ship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading hostile pirate fleets tested his skill and courage, but the thought of finding the lost colonists, of reuniting families ripped apart by fate, spurred him on through the silent immensity of space.
