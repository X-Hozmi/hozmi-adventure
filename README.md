
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting reminder of the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hopeful scribbles, was her only guide to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of a mythical beast that haunted these peaks were enough to chill even the bravest soul.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the stories of its untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as she navigated the treacherous currents of space, jumping between galaxies in search of the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Communication was sporadic, the dangers of rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes ever-present.  But the promise of finding the lost colonists, and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries in uncharted space, fueled her determination, making the vast, inky expanse of the cosmos feel less like a terrifying void and more like a boundless frontier.
