
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a lost city whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from Constantinople to Damascus.  Each creak of the saddle, each wary glance at the horizon, fueled her adventure, a test of both courage and endurance against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  The journey was long, and fraught with peril, but the thrill of discovery propelled her forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a world said to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the vast emptiness between stars held a different kind of peril; rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the chilling isolation of deep space all tested the crew's mettle.  The destination was uncertain, but the potential reward – a new home – made the unimaginable journey worth the risk.
