
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land.  His quest: to find a legendary healing herb rumored to cure the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  The journey was brutal, but the hope of salvation fueled his every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Unlike Reginald's perilous land journey, Eva faced the dangers of cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on unsuspecting explorers. The vastness of space offered a breathtaking beauty, but also an isolating loneliness,  a stark contrast to the shared hardship of Reginald's medieval pilgrimage.  Yet, both shared the same driving force: a relentless pursuit of hope in the face of overwhelming odds.
