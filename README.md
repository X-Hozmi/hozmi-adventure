
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the journey, but the hope of healing fueled his weary legs and determined spirit. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape to traverse, a new opportunity for both peril and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant K'tharr Hegemony, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing hyperdrive malfunctions were daily occurrences.  Yet, the vast expanse of the cosmos held a captivating allure, offering glimpses of alien worlds and the promise of untold riches and knowledge, making the risks worthwhile for this intrepid explorer.
