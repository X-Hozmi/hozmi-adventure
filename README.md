
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city far to the east, burned in her memory.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, promised both peril and the thrilling unknown.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the breadth of the kingdom, a desperate adventure fueled by loyalty and a thirst for survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its multi-hued gases a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of a thousand distant galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would push the ship, and her crew, to their absolute limits.  Warp drives hummed, navigations systems flickered, and the vastness of space, both terrifying and inspiring, pressed in on them, a testament to the boundless exploration and unimaginable risks inherent in interstellar travel.
