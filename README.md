
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already tested their endurance.  Muddy tracks snaked through unforgiving terrain, each day bringing new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the distant cathedral spurred them on, a beacon of faith and hope in the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of bridging galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers, Eva relied on her wits and the advanced technology of her starship.  The vast expanse of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying dangers, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her adventure and the perilous quest that lay ahead.
