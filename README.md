
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their worn leather boots crunched on frozen ground, the rhythmic sound a stark counterpoint to the howling wind. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had already taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadows of brooding forests.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in the dark, starvation gnawing at their bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the unwavering faith that fueled their quest pushed them relentlessly towards their unknown destination.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, its sleek hull a silver tear against the inky canvas of space.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of humming engines and the crackle of subspace comms, punctuated by the breathtaking sight of nebulae and distant galaxies.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of void-born creatures – the intrepid spirit of adventure remained, echoing the countless medieval pilgrims who had dared to tread unknown paths before them.
