
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, pressed onward. The chill wind bit at his exposed skin as he navigated the treacherous, unmarked paths through the Black Forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh surge of adrenaline.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague sweeping his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational currents was a daily challenge, a dance between precision and sheer luck.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for discovery, pressed onward, driven by the possibility of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
