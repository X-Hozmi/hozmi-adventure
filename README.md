
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating dense forests, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager sustenance in sparsely populated villages.  The weight of his responsibility, and the miles yet to cover, pressed heavily upon him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the shimmering void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a voyage spanning light-years and demanding precise navigation through asteroid fields and treacherous nebulae.  Alien encounters were a constant possibility, both hostile and helpful, and the ship's aging hyperdrive was a constant source of anxiety. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of Earth, now a distant memory.
