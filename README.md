
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a stark reminder of the unforgiving beauty and constant danger of medieval travel.  Her destination, a distant castle, felt as mythical as a promised land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a task that required navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unmapped planets.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders, held a constant threat of the unknown.  A single malfunction, a rogue meteor, or a previously undetected wormhole could spell certain doom. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unveiling new worlds, fuelled her relentless pursuit across the star-dusted void.
