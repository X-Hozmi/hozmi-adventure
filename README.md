
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the allure of the unknown propelled her forward, a single determined figure against the vast, unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system failures.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and relentless pursuit of the unknown, a journey fuelled by the promise of discovery beyond the confines of known space.
