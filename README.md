
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward.  The parchment map, clutched tight in his gauntlet, promised riches beyond imagining – a lost city nestled amongst the treacherous peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles standing between him and his destiny.  He rode, fueled by a thirst for glory and the whispered legends of untold treasures.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape back on Earth.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas of alien planets and cosmic wonders, but also held the chilling possibility of encountering unknown threats, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light-years from any rescue.  The galaxy was her oyster, but the journey was fraught with danger.
