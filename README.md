
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled Shrine of St. Elara, had already claimed one of their number to fever.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the relentless rhythm of hoofbeats on rutted tracks, the sting of dust in their eyes, and the constant gnawing fear of bandits and the wild lands beyond the king's reach.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and always, the looming threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Xylossian civilization, rumored to possess technology far beyond humanity's comprehension. The vast distances between stars were a constant companion, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unforeseen gravitational anomalies.  The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the risks, fueled by the promise of a first contact that could rewrite the history of humankind.
