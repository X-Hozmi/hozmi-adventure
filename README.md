
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of parched earth and distant smoke clinging to the air. Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, a quest for a rumored healing balm, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the endless expanse tested her endurance.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in desolate villages, and constantly battling the gnawing uncertainty of her path.  The whispers of Zerzura, however, fueled her unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking but treacherous shortcut between galaxies. His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the starving colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became commonplace during his interstellar voyages.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the most daring terrestrial adventures, demanding a level of skill and courage exceeding any medieval quest. The fate of a planet rested on his shoulders, a far greater burden than any treasure a medieval adventurer could hope to find.
