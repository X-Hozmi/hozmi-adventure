
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth. Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants and pilgrims, snaked across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of encountering new landscapes – towering sand dunes, hidden oases teeming with life, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  The journey was perilous, a test of endurance and resilience, but the lure of Zerzura, with its rumored fountains of youth and untold riches, fueled their onward push.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  Faster-than-light travel masked the vast distances, yet each jump to a new system held its own unique dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien civilizations, both friendly and hostile.  The cosmos, a breathtaking canvas of nebulas and distant suns, was a realm of wonder and terrifying unknowns.
