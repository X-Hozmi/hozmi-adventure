
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions – a chipped map, a worn prayer book, and a few dried figs –  all that stood between her and the fabled city of Zaragoza, where she hoped to find her long-lost brother.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the nearby woods, heightened the thrill of the unknown, the danger a constant companion on her perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of a swirling nebula.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own challenges – unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure. Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of charting uncharted territories and finding new life, fueled her unwavering determination to complete her mission and return with her crew to a civilization reaching for the stars.
