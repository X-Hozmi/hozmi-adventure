
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving desert tested her endurance at every turn. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of discovering ancient secrets and legendary riches, spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh invitation to face whatever challenges lay ahead.  The map, a tattered relic passed down through generations, was her only guide in this sea of sand.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace on her interstellar voyages.  Her mission: to chart unexplored systems and search for habitable planets, a quest as daring and uncertain as any medieval pilgrimage.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also isolating; the weight of responsibility for her crew rested heavily on her shoulders.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover new worlds and expand humanity's reach among the stars, fuelled her relentless exploration across the cosmic ocean.
