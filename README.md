
The year is 1347.  Our band of travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the muddied tracks of the Rhineland.  Each dawn brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the cure for a devastating plague sweeping across Europe.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a constant gamble against the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the fabled planet of Aethel, rumored to possess a powerful energy source capable of powering entire star systems.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the patrol ships of the Kryll Empire was commonplace; each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.  The thrill of discovery, the constant challenge of survival against the vastness of space, were the fuel that propelled their journey.
