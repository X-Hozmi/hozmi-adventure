
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a miraculous healing balm for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the even greater peril of disease.  Yet, the hope of reaching Zerzura, of defying the dangers of the vast and unpredictable landscape, propelled him ever forward.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* across the inky expanse between galaxies. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, adrift amidst the swirling nebulae of the Xylos Cluster.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien life forms both wondrous and terrifying were merely routine hazards.  The vastness of space, a terrifying beauty punctuated by the cold indifference of the void, presented a different kind of challenge, one of scientific precision and unwavering courage, but the potential reward – finding the lost colonists – made the impossible journey worth the risk.
