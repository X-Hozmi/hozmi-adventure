
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s worn boots pounded the rutted track, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear clung to the wind, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next hill – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the elements and the malice of men. Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered of in hushed tones across tavern tables, spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the darkness of her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', a tiny speck amidst colossal cosmic structures.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been fraught with peril, their hyperdrive sputtering on the edge of collapse. Now, faced with the uncharted expanse of a new galaxy,  Ryla's crew braced for the unknown – hostile alien species, unmapped gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  The riches of Andromeda, however, whispered promises of unimaginable power and knowledge, worth risking everything to attain.
