Days bled into weeks as our caravan traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on our backs one moment, and icy rain lashing us the next.  We skirted bandit-infested forests, forded raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the path was barely a goat track.

Our mission – to survey for habitable zones and gather samples – was fraught with its own set of challenges. The local fauna, sentient and hostile, proved a formidable adversary, necessitating the use of advanced weaponry and cunning tactics to secure our research.  Exploring the crimson canyons and iridescent oceans felt like charting the very edge of the known universe.
