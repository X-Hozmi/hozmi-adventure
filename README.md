
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the muddy track barely visible beneath the relentless downpour.  Each creak of our laden wagons, each snort from our exhausted mounts, was a testament to the arduous journey across the treacherous highlands.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and untold riches, fueled our aching muscles and dwindling supplies.  We pressed on, the looming silhouette of the mountains a constant reminder of the dangers – and the potential rewards – that lay ahead.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our guide.  The crimson nebula of Xylos burned brightly in the viewport as the Althea, our generation ship, hurtled through the inky black.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  Months bled into years under the artificial sun, the hum of the engines a constant companion to the hushed whispers of hope and fear.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a testament to human ingenuity and a constant reminder of the fragility of life in the face of the unknown.
