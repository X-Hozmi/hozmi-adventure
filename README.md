
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of France.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the uncertainty in our hearts. We're bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brings the hope of reaching our destination, but each sunset reveals the vastness of our undertaking and the fragility of our lives against the backdrop of a medieval world.  Yet, the allure of the distant city, the whispers of exotic spices and untold riches, fuels our onward trek.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant lullaby, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle outside.  Nebulae painted across the void shimmer in hues unseen on Earth, and distant galaxies spiral into existence as we pierce the fabric of space-time. Our mission: to survey Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star light years away.  The risks are immense – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of equipment malfunction – but the potential rewards, the discovery of life beyond Earth, outweighs every fear.  The vastness of the cosmos, once a dream, is now our reality.
