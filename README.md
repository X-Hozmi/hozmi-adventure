
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – the key to saving her village from famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the relentless heat itself.  Her journey, a desperate race against time and the elements, tested her courage and resilience, each step a gamble in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming algae to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape back on Earth, but the vastness of space held a different kind of peril – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the loneliness of interstellar travel.  The success of the colony, and perhaps the future of humanity, rested on her shoulders.
