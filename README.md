
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of haunted forests.  Each day brought new peril: bandits lurking in the shadows, starvation gnawing at their bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of Ys, a city whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  The journey across the galaxy had been fraught with its own challenges – asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize their ship, unpredictable wormhole jumps that warped spacetime around them, and the ever-present tension of operating outside the protection of the Galactic Federation. But the promise of first contact, of uncovering a new civilization, fuelled her unwavering determination, making the unimaginable risks a price worth paying.
