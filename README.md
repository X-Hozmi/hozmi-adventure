
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn map, clutched in a calloused hand, offered little solace against the encroaching twilight.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Ys, a destination whispered about in hushed tones, a place of unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Bandit patrols, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of illness were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the lure of the unknown pushed her ever closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a previously unexplored nebula, a region teeming with potentially habitable planets.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre, alien phenomena was all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the immense scale of the universe and the courage required to explore its furthest reaches.
