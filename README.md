
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city of untold riches guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the promise of glory and fortune, spurred him on, a single flickering candle in the vast, unforgiving darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of starlight and calculated risk; navigating asteroid fields, dealing with unpredictable warp storms, and the constant threat of pirate incursions across the galactic expanse.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed onward. The future of humanity, a new home amongst the stars, depended on her reaching Kepler-186f and securing a future for mankind beyond the cradle of Earth.
