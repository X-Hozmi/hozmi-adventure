
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, holding ancient secrets and untold riches, fueled her relentless journey.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine were mere inconveniences in her quest for knowledge and fortune. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit, pushing ever eastward towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, charting a course through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate habitable planets for a burgeoning human colony.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding hostile alien encounters became commonplace.  The vastness of space, a constant companion, instilled both awe and a profound sense of loneliness.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for creating a new home among the stars, spurred her onward, each jump to warp speed a leap of faith into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
