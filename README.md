
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on my shoulders as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Each step was a gamble; loose rocks threatened to send me tumbling into the abyss, while the biting wind carried whispers of bandits and wild beasts.  My meager supplies dwindled, but the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient knowledge, spurred me onward.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown was too strong to resist.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Through the viewport, a kaleidoscope of nebulae swirled, a cosmic ocean teeming with uncharted star systems.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope vanished centuries ago.  The vastness of space held its own terrifying beauty, the risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms a constant companion. Yet, the possibility of discovering a lost civilization, of uncovering secrets hidden amongst the stars, outweighed any fear.  The journey to Xylos was not merely a voyage through space, but a voyage through time.
