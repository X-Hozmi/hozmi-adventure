
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant battle hangs heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next hill. Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Carcassonne, a journey fraught with brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the plague.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy is measured not in days, but in generations,  a voyage fuelled by ambition and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.  While the dangers are different – warp storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien species – the spirit of adventure remains the same, a burning desire to push beyond the known boundaries of existence.
