
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow stinging her nostrils.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions – a map stained with rain, a chipped flintlock, and a worn prayer book.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and mortal danger.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on her journey from the shattered kingdom of Eldoria to the rumored sanctuary of Avalon, a quest fueled by hope and the desperate need for a new beginning.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, speckled with the glittering dust of a million dying stars, both awed and humbled her.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers remained – rogue asteroids, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile lifeforms.  This journey, however, was far more than just a voyage through space; it was a gamble on the future of countless worlds.
