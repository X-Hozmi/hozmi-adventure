
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant cry of a hawk.  His quest, to find the lost city of Eldoria and its legendary Sunstone, had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of ancient magic still lingered. Each sunrise brought new peril, each sunset the faint hope of reaching his goal before winter's icy grip claimed him.

A thousand light-years from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Nebulae, beautiful though deadly, were shortcuts through the vast distances between star systems.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The hyperdrive hummed, a low thrum against the backdrop of cosmic silence, punctuated only by the crackle of the comms system and the occasional siren warning of approaching asteroid fields.  Every jump was a gamble, a dance with the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.
