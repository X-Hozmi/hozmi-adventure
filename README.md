
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his chainmail rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  The map, stained with sweat and rain, promised riches beyond the whispering forests and treacherous mountains ahead – a lost city said to hold the secrets of a forgotten king.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold glory.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reminder of the immense distances conquered, the unimaginable technology harnessed.  Yet, the cosmos held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the black between stars.  The vast expanse of space, despite its beauty, was as unforgiving as any medieval wilderness, demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering spirit of adventure.
