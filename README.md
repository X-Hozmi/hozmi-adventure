
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of untold riches and exotic spices, pushes us onward.  We trade stories around crackling fires at night, sharing whispers of mythical beasts and distant cities, fueling our determination to reach the shimmering East.

Centuries later, the hum of hyperdrive fills the bridge of the *Starseeker*.  Ahead, the swirling nebula of Xylos promises both wonder and peril.  Our crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, navigates asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, our journey charting a course through unmapped star systems. The quest for the legendary Xylos artifact, whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, fuels our interstellar voyage, a risk balanced against the potential for groundbreaking discovery.
