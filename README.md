
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Ahead lay treacherous forests haunted by brigands, unforgiving mountains, and the ever-present threat of disease, but the whispers of Ys's untold riches and magical artifacts spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle of a thousand shimmering suns.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across galaxies was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids – but the potential rewards, a revolutionary leap in interstellar exploration, outweighed any danger for Eva and her intrepid crew.
