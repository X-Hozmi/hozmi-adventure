
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of Aragon a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of whether she would reach her destination before it was too late.  The journey was arduous, testing her physical and mental strength, but the hope of healing fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were commonplace.  Unlike Elara’s journey across a single landmass, Eva faced the infinite expanse of space, a loneliness only amplified by the vast distances between potential life-sustaining planets.  Yet, the hope of finding the colonists, and potentially discovering new worlds, spurred her on across the light-years.
