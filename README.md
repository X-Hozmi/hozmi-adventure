
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the relentless desert itself.  But the hope of finding salvation spurred her onward, her determination a match for the hardships she faced.  The journey was long, perilous, and shrouded in uncertainty, but the allure of the unknown fueled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  The jump through hyperspace was a breathtaking gamble, the risks of encountering spatial anomalies or pirate fleets ever-present. Yet, the promise of terraforming a new world, of building a future amongst the stars, outweighed the dangers. The vastness of space held a thrilling, terrifying beauty, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown frontiers of the cosmos.
