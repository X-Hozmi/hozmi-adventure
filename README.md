
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with salted meat and questionable bread, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the vast and unpredictable landscape, fueled his journey, pushing him further into the heart of the unexplored.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of space.  Navigation charts were unreliable, alien lifeforms unpredictable, and the ship's aging hyperdrive a constant source of anxiety.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of a forgotten civilization, spurred her onward, across the star-strewn canvas of the cosmos.
