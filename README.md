
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône valley, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her homespun tunic.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Gilles, felt as distant and improbable as the stars themselves.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each howling wolf in the distance, was a challenge, a test of her endurance.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the perilous journey, a tapestry woven with both hardship and the exhilarating promise of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  His mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The dangers were different now – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unknown inhabitants of newly discovered worlds. But the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push beyond known boundaries, remained the same, a powerful current driving him onward through the silent vastness.
