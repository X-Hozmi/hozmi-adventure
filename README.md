
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to recover the stolen reliquary of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test his courage, and the constant threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each nightfall the gnawing fear of never reaching his destination.  Yet, the glint of the setting sun on his battered armour fuels his determination, pushing him ever onward towards his sacred goal.

Alternatively, in 2742, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the political intrigue of intergalactic alliances are her daily bread. The breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the terrifying reality of encountering unknown alien life forms are constant companions. Each jump through hyperspace brings her closer to either salvation or oblivion, a gamble on the survival of her species.
