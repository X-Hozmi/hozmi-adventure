
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her safekeeping on this perilous journey to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the devastating plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, but the thought of her ailing family spurred her onward, into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Corvus piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast distances they were traversing, the perilous asteroid fields they navigated, and the unpredictable nature of intergalactic space.  Success meant a new age of exploration; failure meant oblivion swallowed by the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
