
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, to find her brother lost amongst the mercenary companies, was a tapestry woven with hardship.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the late autumn air. Yet, the glint of distant spires, the shared stories around crackling fires with weary travelers, and the thrill of each new dawn fueled her onward, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of medieval adversity.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast distances, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders posed challenges far beyond those faced by land-bound medieval travelers.  Yet, advanced technology – warp drives, automated shields, and sophisticated navigation systems – allowed Eva to conquer the interstellar void, her courage and determination echoing the spirit of those medieval adventurers who dared to explore the unknown, though on a scale unimaginably grander.
