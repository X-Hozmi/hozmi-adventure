
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a feud that had claimed her family.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this wild, untamed land.  Reaching the distant city of Avignon, a beacon of promise across the vast expanse, felt as far away as the stars themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, was fraught with peril: unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of space pirates, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the vastness of space held a different kind of beauty, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders that spurred him onward, a pale imitation of the adventurous spirit that had driven Elara across the medieval world.
