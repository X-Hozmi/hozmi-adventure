
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold, and the desperate hope for salvation, spurred them relentlessly forward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away from Earth.

The vast expanse of space held both wonder and peril, testing her courage and resilience with every jump to hyperspace.
