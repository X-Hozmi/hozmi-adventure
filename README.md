
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, scorching heat, or the lurking menace of starvation, but the whispered promise of Zerzura – a city of gold and unimaginable wonders – keeps our spirits flickering. The journey is arduous, testing our resilience and forging bonds as strong as the ancient stones that mark our path.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek starship *Stardust* cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its destination a distant galaxy teeming with unexplored planets.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the ancient whispers of quasars, charting a course through asteroid fields and unmapped wormholes. The thrill isn't just the discovery of new worlds and civilizations, but the constant challenge of survival against the vastness and unforgiving nature of space; a cosmic dance with gravity, radiation, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
