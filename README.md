
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and fear.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Aethelberht from the clutches of the Black Hand, a band of brigands rumored to dwell in the shadowed crags of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential harbinger of danger, a reminder of the perilous journey ahead through bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a constant hum of the ship's engines a lonely counterpoint to the silent, glittering expanse.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for navigational errors, encounters with hostile alien life, or the catastrophic failure of the warp drive – a constant gamble for survival against the indifference of the cosmos.
