
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Each sunrise revealed a new tapestry of rolling hills, ancient forests, and the occasional fortified town clinging precariously to a hillside.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed our journey across the splintered kingdom.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands whispered promises of adventure, fueled by tales of mythical beasts and forgotten cities, pushing us ever onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway. My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness, its engines a low hum against the silence of space. Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the swirling chaos of the nebulae.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  The dangers are different now— cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters—but the spirit of adventure, the yearning for the unknown, burns just as brightly as it did in those medieval days.
