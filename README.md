The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless journey.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort of his horse, was a testament to the grueling adventure ahead – a quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing king.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but small prices to pay for the hope of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting roar against the vast, silent expanse of space.   Navigation charts flickered on her console, a testament to the cutting-edge technology allowing her to traverse the impossible distances between worlds, in search of a new home for humanity, a new Eden among the stars.
