
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band of knights spurred their weary mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, kept their spirits high as they pressed deeper into the untamed wilderness.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate, Eva and her crew faced the vast emptiness of interstellar space, relying on their wits, advanced technology, and a shared sense of purpose to reach their destination. The cosmos, both beautiful and perilous, promised a discovery that could rewrite history, but also held the potential for unimaginable dangers.
