
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unforgiving desert.  Yet, the glint of hope, fuelled by whispers of ancient magic and untold riches, spurred them onward, their journey a perilous tapestry woven with hardship and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirates of the Outer Rim demanded unwavering skill and nerve.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders, simultaneously inspired awe and a profound sense of isolation, a stark contrast to the close-knit camaraderie within her crew as they faced the perils of interstellar travel.
