
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the glint of snow-capped peaks on the horizon fueled her relentless journey, a promise of a new life beyond the shadow of death.  The road was long, the dangers many, but the thirst for survival was stronger still.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Ryla and her crew faced challenges as formidable as any medieval knight.  Their journey, however, spanned light-years, not miles, the stakes higher than any earthly kingdom, with the fate of galactic civilization potentially hanging in the balance.
