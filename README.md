
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before him.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, was a perilous one.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease haunted his every step.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar forests teeming with wild beasts to bartering for meager provisions in isolated villages, a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, was also a constant source of danger.  Uncharted asteroid fields, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present risk of system failure tested her skills and the ship's resilience. Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a true testament to the courage and technological prowess of humanity's interstellar expansion.
