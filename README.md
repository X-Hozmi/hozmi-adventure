
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he urged the beast onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of salvation fueled his weary limbs, pushing him ever closer to his desperate goal across the harsh and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a feat considered impossible by many.   Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all part of the daily grind.  But the potential rewards – untold wealth and the expansion of human civilization – were enough to keep her and her crew pushing the boundaries of known space.
