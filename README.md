
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cart piled high with questionable provisions and even more questionable companions.  We aimed for the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested our resolve at every turn. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a ford to cross, a castle to negotiate, or simply the relentless march across sun-baked plains. The shimmering mirage of distant oases often proved cruel illusions, replaced by the harsh reality of thirst and exhaustion.  Our quest, fuelled by faith and a desperate hope for redemption, pushed us onward.

Alternatively, imagine 2742. Our starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts a lonely path through the Orion Arm.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  We’re bound for Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  But the cosmos is a vast and unforgiving place; derelict space stations, pirate convoys, and the ever-present threat of nebula storms litter our path.  The thrill of discovery, however, outweighs the dangers, the siren call of uncharted worlds and alien civilizations too tempting to resist.
