
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, heightened the sense of peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, the whispers of plague rode the wind, and the sheer immensity of the journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela – felt as vast and daunting as the sky above. Yet, with every sunrise, a renewed hope sparked within her, fueled by the unwavering faith that guided her steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, showcasing the intricate dance of celestial bodies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the chilling vastness of space.  Though the journey was measured in years rather than months,  the thrill of discovery, the possibility of uncovering new life and worlds, far outweighed the risks inherent in traversing the uncharted cosmic sea.
