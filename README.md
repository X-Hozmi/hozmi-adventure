
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her small band of travelers, a motley crew bound by a shared thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches in Constantinople, pressed onward.  Each day brought its own challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the exotic East, of silks and spices and legendary cities, spurred them on, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Starseeker*, his knuckles white.  Ahead lay the Xylos nebula, a swirling kaleidoscope of gas and dust concealing a rumored gateway to the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents was a hair-raising gamble, a dance with cosmic forces that could crush their ship like an eggshell.  But the chance to uncover the secrets of a galaxy beyond their own, to chart territories never before seen by human eyes, outweighed the risks.  The thrill of exploration, the uncharted territories,  pushed the *Starseeker* relentlessly forward, a tiny speck of ambition against the immensity of space.
