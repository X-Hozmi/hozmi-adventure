
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the rugged, sun-baked landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a faint comfort against the ever-present threat of bandits.  Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions and the King's decree – a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to the distant Duke.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger, testing her courage and resilience on a journey measured not in miles, but in the endurance of her spirit and the fickle whims of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace throttle forward, the nebula swirling outside the cockpit window like cosmic paint.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leapt across the void between galaxies, bound for the Kepler-186f system.  The mission: to retrieve a crucial artifact from a long-lost colony.  Unlike Elara's medieval trek, Rexx navigated through asteroid fields and wormholes, his greatest dangers not brigands, but rogue gravitational pulls and the unpredictable behavior of alien lifeforms lurking in the unexplored reaches of space.
