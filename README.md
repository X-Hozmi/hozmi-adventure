
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as her trusty mare, Bess, picks her way across the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the sense of adventure.  Ahead lie the whispered promises of the legendary city of K'tharr, rumored to hold untold riches and even more dangerous secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are but small prices to pay for the chance to uncover its mysteries.  Her heart pounds not with fear, but with the exhilarating thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Reyes pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by ancient, alien star maps.  The vastness of space, speckled with a million shimmering suns, dwarfs her ship, a tiny speck amidst the cosmic grandeur.  Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of the galaxy.  The potential rewards, however – discovering new habitable worlds, uncovering long-lost civilizations, and confronting the enigmatic 'Voidborn' – far outweigh the risks. The cosmos is her playground, a limitless expanse of adventure waiting to be explored.
