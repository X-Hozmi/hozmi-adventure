
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his chainmail glinting under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as they traversed the treacherous Blackwood Forest, their destination the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each rustle of leaves, each shadow cast by the ancient oaks, promised both peril and untold riches, for the road less traveled was paved with danger and the whispered legends of forgotten magic.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small prices to pay for the hope that bloomed in his weary heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real danger lay in the uncharted sectors, teeming with unknown lifeforms and the lingering threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic beauty, was a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single ship, yet the potential rewards—a new home for humanity—fueled her unwavering determination.
