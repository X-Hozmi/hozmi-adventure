
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf of bread, and a map promising riches beyond the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the whispered tales of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, fueled her weary steps.  Each sunrise was a gamble, each sunset a victory.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of cosmic dust and swirling nebulas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, was fraught with peril: asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of a new world, lush and teeming with life, spurred her onward.  The vastness of space was terrifying, yet thrilling, and each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith into the unknown.
