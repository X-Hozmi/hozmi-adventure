
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains of France.  Ahead, the Pyrenees Mountains loom, a formidable barrier between her and the promised sanctuary of Spain.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse grasses, holds the potential for both beauty and peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this arduous journey, yet the hope of a new life fuels her onward, a flicker of defiance against the encroaching darkness of the Black Death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours swirling around her are breathtaking, a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the control panel.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the ever-present threat of space pirates is just another day’s work for Ryla, but the weight of her mission – to find a new home for a dying Earth – rests heavily on her shoulders.  The vastness of space both terrifies and inspires her, a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities and overwhelming dangers of interstellar travel.
