
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest for a lost herbal remedy, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling to their deaths, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each day brought new challenges, testing her resilience and pushing her to the limits of her endurance, but the promise of healing fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet within the uncharted nebula of Xylos.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks but in light-years, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile spacefaring civilizations or encountering unpredictable celestial phenomena.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of deep space became routine, as the pursuit of a new home for humanity drove her ever closer to the unknown.
