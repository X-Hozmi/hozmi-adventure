
The year is 1347.  Our band of travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the muddy ruts of a forgotten Roman road.  Each step brought the chill wind of the approaching winter closer, as did the whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Forest.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Days blurred into weeks, marked by skirmishes with highwaymen, encounters with strange hermits, and the constant gnawing hunger of the open road.  Their survival depended not only on their courage but on their cunning and their ability to navigate by the stars and the whispers of the wind.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across lightyears to a distant galaxy.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization.  Their journey was fraught with perils: navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the ever-present threat of radiation. The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life against the immensity of the cosmos.
