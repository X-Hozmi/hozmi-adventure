
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely more than a goat trail, snaked through the brooding Carpathian Mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the ever-present danger.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the biting chill of the approaching winter all threatened his journey to Constantinople, a quest to recover a sacred relic stolen from his monastery.  His only companions were his loyal squire and the ghosts of countless travelers who had perished along this unforgiving path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on unsuspecting transports.  But unlike Sir Kaelan, Eva had the advanced technology of the 27th century at her disposal – shielding, powerful engines, and a crew of highly trained specialists. Still, the vastness of space held a different kind of fear, a cold, lonely isolation that could break even the bravest spirit.
