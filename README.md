
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a devastating plague gripping their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria’s spires, a distant promise on the horizon, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the spectacle. The journey to the Andromeda Galaxy was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant hum of the ship's failing hyperdrive.  But the promise of discovering a new, habitable world, one untouched by the conflicts that ravaged her own, pushed her onwards. The vast emptiness of space held a terrifying beauty, a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities, and the equally infinite risks, of interstellar travel.
