
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, guided his weary horse across the windswept plains.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant rain hung in the air, a poor comfort against the gnawing hunger in his belly.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new life for humanity, escaping the dying embers of Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, and the unwavering hope for a future beyond the confines of a dying world, fueled her unwavering determination to reach the distant, hopeful shores of Kepler-186f.
