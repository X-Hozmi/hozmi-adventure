The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a forest haunted by whispers of goblins and the occasional, chilling howl of a wolf.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, transforming the journey into a constant test of courage and endurance against the wild, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling the occasional space pirate proved less arduous than the political maneuvering back on Earth, but the sheer scale of the cosmos, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, filled her with a sense of wonder that dwarfed even the most perilous situations.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating.
