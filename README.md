
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains of Anatolia as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward. Their destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes guarded by brigands, scorching deserts swallowing their meager supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of glory, spurred them on, their battered armor gleaming under the unforgiving sun.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Xylan civilization, rumored to possess technology far exceeding humanity's.  Warp jumps sent jolts through the ship, each one a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  Alien storms threatened to tear the vessel apart, while the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed, their shadowy ships lurking in the black void between stars.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential for interstellar peace, fueled her unwavering determination.
