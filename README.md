
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack mules and weary travellers, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air shimmers with heat, punctuated by the cries of hawks circling overhead.  Each day brings its own challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the constant gnawing fear of disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fuels our journey – the promise of spices in the East, the legendary silks of Cathay, a fortune awaiting those bold enough to brave the perils of the Silk Road.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Instead of bandits, we face cosmic radiation and the ever-present threat of nebulae storms.  Instead of rivers, we navigate asteroid fields, each rock a potential graveyard.  But the allure of new worlds, of alien civilizations and undiscovered planets teeming with life, far outweighs the dangers.  The universe stretches before us, an endless expanse of adventure waiting to be explored.
