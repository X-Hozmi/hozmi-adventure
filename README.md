
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both the beauty and the danger of the road ahead – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with its own perils:  rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the promise of a better future, of survival against the odds, fuelled her determination to reach her destination, a tiny beacon of hope in the cold, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
