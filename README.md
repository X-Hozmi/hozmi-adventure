
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, urged his destrier onward. The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Carpathia, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to retrieve the stolen Sunstone, a legendary relic said to hold the power of the very sun itself.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences on his arduous journey, fueled by a burning desire to restore balance to his kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter.'  Vast distances separating planets and entire galaxies were no longer insurmountable obstacles.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors and locate habitable worlds for a rapidly expanding human civilization.  Dealing with unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were just a part of her daily life, challenges accepted with the fearless spirit of a pioneer venturing into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
