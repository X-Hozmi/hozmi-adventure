
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every league covered, the allure of Constantinople – a city of untold riches and vibrant cultures – fuels our weary steps.  The whispers of silk roads and exotic spices mingle with the grunts of our oxen, a symphony of hardship and hope echoing across the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky blackness, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of interstellar space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, face perils far removed from bandits and blizzards; cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present unknown of alien life.  But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity's reach, drives us onward, towards the furthest reaches of the galaxy.
