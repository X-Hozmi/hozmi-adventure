
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection against the biting wind, but the thrill of her quest – to reach the legendary city of Ys before winter's grip tightened – kept her pushing onward.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown, a prize that promised both glory and answers to ancient riddles.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a silent path through the nebula, its sensors constantly scanning for wormhole signatures.  The journey to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel, was fraught with peril: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the potential reward – unlocking faster-than-light travel and opening up the galaxy to humankind – fuelled her determination, making even the vast emptiness of space feel thrillingly alive.
