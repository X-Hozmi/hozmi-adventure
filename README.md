
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust in a desperate race against nightfall.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the King's ailing daughter.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, whispered-about bandit dens, and the ever-present threat of starvation, all challenges that tested their courage and forged an unbreakable bond between them.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, but also the promise of further discovery.

Millennia later, Captain Elara's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky black of interstellar space.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of the void were all part of the journey.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, humbled Elara and her crew, reminding them of the incredible fragility and immeasurable potential of their existence.  The discovery of Xylos, however, remained a distant hope, a beacon guiding them through the endless night.
