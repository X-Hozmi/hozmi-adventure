
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from over; whispers of a lost city, rich with forgotten magic, fueled her relentless trek.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and untold reward. Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the lure of adventure – of discovering the unknown – spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning, spacefaring humanity.  The vast expanse of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers equally profound.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms demanded constant vigilance.  Yet, the boundless curiosity that drove humanity to the stars pushed her forward, fueled by the promise of discovery and the thrill of venturing into the unmapped cosmos.
