
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold ancient healing knowledge.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the dangers – bandits, starvation, the elements themselves – that lay between her and her destination.  This journey, a gamble against fate, was her only chance.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace lever, his starship *Stardust* leaping across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylos planet, rumored to possess a mineral capable of powering interstellar travel for millennia to come.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Hegemony, Rexx and his crew relied on their wits, their advanced technology, and a healthy dose of luck to reach their destination.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a lonely and perilous arena, fraught with dangers far exceeding those of any medieval landscape.
