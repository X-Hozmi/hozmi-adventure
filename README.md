
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales told in taverns.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger were the true companions on this arduous trek across Europe.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching the holy city, but also the ever-present threat of the unknown, a constant reminder of life's fragility and the raw beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and demanding years of isolation aboard her ship.  The breathtaking vistas of alien planets, each a vibrant tapestry of colours and impossible landscapes, were juxtaposed with the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering uncharted spatial anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space was both exhilarating and terrifying, a constant test of courage and ingenuity in the relentless exploration of the cosmos.
