
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, swung against her hip, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  She wasn't simply traveling; she was fleeing, seeking refuge from a vengeful baron across treacherous mountain passes and unforgiving valleys, her hope a whisper in the wind. Each creak of the mule’s saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger, but the fire in her belly burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of unseen celestial bodies was a daily challenge. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion, each jump to hyperspace a gamble with fate.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of unlocking galactic secrets, fuelled her relentless pursuit across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
