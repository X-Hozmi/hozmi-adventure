
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had already claimed two of his companions, swallowed by the unforgiving wilderness.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic and untold riches, fuelled his relentless pursuit despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought a new test of endurance, a renewed gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, where the simplest task could become a fight for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant light-years from her home planet.  The risks were astronomical – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  But the potential rewards – knowledge that could save her civilization – outweighed the fear.  Navigating the cosmos wasn't just a journey across space, it was a voyage into the unknown, a relentless push against the boundaries of human exploration.
