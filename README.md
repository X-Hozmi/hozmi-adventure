
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chausses as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the camaraderie forged with fellow travelers, the breathtaking vistas, and the whispered legends of ancient wonders spurred her onward, each hardship forging a stronger spirit and a deeper connection to the land.  She carried not only her meager possessions, but also the hopes and dreams of her village nestled safely behind her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos, its hyperdrive a hum beneath the deck. Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival on a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and braving the unpredictable forces of hyperspace were all in a day's work. But the sheer breathtaking beauty of nebulae painted across the cosmos, the discovery of strange new life forms, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge fueled her tireless exploration. The vastness of space was daunting, but the potential for discovery was far greater.
