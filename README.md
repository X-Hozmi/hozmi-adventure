
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a map more faded than hope, and a chipped amulet – a reminder of the brother she sought across the treacherous lands.  Bandits, famine, and unforgiving terrain were constant threats, but the whispered tales of a legendary healer in the distant kingdom spurred her onward, a flickering ember of faith in the heart of the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Sparks' Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a breathtaking leap across unimaginable distances.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of anti-matter to the besieged colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of collapse.  The void held its own perils – pirate raids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown, hostile entities lurking in the shadows of unexplored galaxies.
