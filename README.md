
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and shadowed forests, across roaring rivers and treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the deep woods, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the plague that stalked the land. Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the distant cathedral spurred them on, a beacon of faith in a world steeped in hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant in a far-flung galaxy.  The journey, measured in light-years, had been fraught with peril – navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and contending with the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the potential scientific breakthrough, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the universe, fueled her relentless drive, a modern-day quest as daring and profound as any medieval pilgrimage.
