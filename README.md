
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, spurred his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to swallow men whole, and beyond that, the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  His meager band of companions, weary but resolute, pressed on, their hearts pounding a rhythm against the relentless clang of their armor, a counterpoint to the wind's mournful song across the desolate plains.  Every creak of saddle leather, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, echoing silence of space.  With her small crew, she faced the unknown – potential hostile alien life, equipment malfunctions, the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation – but the lure of discovering new worlds, of charting the unmapped territories of the galaxy, fueled their courage and made the risks worthwhile.
