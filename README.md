
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the dreaded Black Death itself.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown.  Alien lifeforms, derelict space stations, and the ever-present threat of warp-core failure tested her crew's limits, pushing them to the edge of their endurance in a vast, unforgiving cosmos.
