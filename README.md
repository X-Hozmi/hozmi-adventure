
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King’s ransom, a heavy chest bound in iron, jostled precariously behind him.  Their journey to the distant port city of Aquilonia was fraught with peril; bandits roamed the lawless stretches between kingdoms, and the whispers of a monstrous beast lurking in the Blackwood Forest chilled even the bravest knight.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their resolve and the endurance of their mounts, as they pressed ever closer to their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of a million distant suns.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the newly discovered planet Xylos, a world teeming with exotic and potentially dangerous lifeforms.  Navigating asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a constant test of her skill and the ship's resilience. The galaxy was a vast, unforgiving ocean, yet the lure of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onwards across the uncharted expanse of space.
