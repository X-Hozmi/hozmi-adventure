
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a vital message to Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of the plague clung to the wind.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each hesitant footstep, was a gamble against the elements, the brigands, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and the slim hope of reaching her destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian artifact, a source of unimaginable power.  Asteroids the size of moons loomed, and the gravity wells of distant planets tugged at his vessel.  The vastness of space held its own dangers, from unpredictable solar flares to the lurking threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of the artifact, the chance to rewrite galactic history, spurred him onward through the uncharted darkness between the stars.
