
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the muddy track barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort of our exhausted mounts was a counterpoint to the rustling leaves and the distant, unsettling howl of wolves.  Our quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging our village.  Every sunrise brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled our relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Conversely, centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though safer than a medieval trek, was fraught with its own perils – unpredictable asteroid fields, the constant hum of the warp drive, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  But unlike her medieval counterparts, Eva possessed advanced technology: sophisticated navigation systems, powerful shields, and a crew capable of overcoming any obstacle. Yet, the yearning for discovery, the pursuit of the unknown, was much the same.
