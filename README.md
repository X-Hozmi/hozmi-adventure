
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the rutted track as I urged my horse onward, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promised both peril and untold riches – whispered rumors of a lost city nestled within their jagged peaks fuelled my journey. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were small prices to pay for the glory, the gold, and the stories I’d bring back to the village. This was no mere journey; it was a pilgrimage to the edge of the known world.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as our starship leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust and starlight, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes.  Our mission: to chart unexplored systems, to seek out new life and new civilizations.  The risks were immense – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present danger of system failure – but the promise of discovering the unimaginable propelled us forward, across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
