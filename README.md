
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a land whispered to hold untold riches and magical artifacts, had been arduous. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the constant gnawing hunger was a relentless companion. Yet, the lure of adventure, the chance to etch his name into legend, spurred him on, each sunrise a fresh promise of discovery despite the ever-present danger.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Xylos galaxy, a journey fraught with peril from rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  While lacking the immediate physical hardship of Thomas's medieval trek,  Eva faced the mental strain of isolation, the constant vigilance required for safe passage through the vast emptiness of space, and the unknown challenges that lay hidden behind each newly discovered star system.  The allure of the cosmos, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries, pushed her and her crew to the edge of endurance.
