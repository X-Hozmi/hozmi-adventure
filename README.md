
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the arduous journey across the Duchy of Aquitaine.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, carried whispers of bandits and rumors of war.  My meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, yet the allure of the fabled city of Carcassonne, shimmering like a distant mirage, propelled me onward.  Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down my spine, but the thrill of the unknown, the promise of adventure, far outweighed any fear.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  The starfield outside, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscape.  My mission: to chart the unexplored K'tharr system, a risky endeavor filled with potential encounters with unknown civilizations and perilous asteroid fields.   The vast emptiness of space, while intimidating, held a different kind of thrill than the forests of medieval Europe – a thrill born of boundless possibility and the daunting mystery of the cosmos.
