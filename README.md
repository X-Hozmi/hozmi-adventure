Ahead lay the treacherous Whispering Woods, rumored to be haunted by goblins and worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled her fear and her determination, a constant battle against the unknown dangers of the medieval landscape.  Survival meant relying on her wits, her meager supplies, and the kindness of strangers – a kindness as rare and precious as gold.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console.  The jump to Kepler-186f was unstable; readings showed a gravitational anomaly.

Failure meant not just financial ruin for the corporation, but also the potential loss of valuable resources vital to humanity's expansion.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking spectacle, held both the promise of untold riches and the very real threat of sudden, catastrophic death – a risk Rexx and his crew were willing to take.
