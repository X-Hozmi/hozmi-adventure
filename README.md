
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a formidable silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and herbs; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold potent healing remedies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements—all part of the perilous, unpredictable adventure that lay between her and salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Xylos nebula.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also harbored threats of unforeseen gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of pirate fleets preying on unsuspecting interstellar travelers.  The thrill of exploration was matched only by the daunting scale of the journey, a testament to human ambition pushing beyond the familiar confines of their solar system.
