
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, a knight errant with a thirst for glory and a map more faded than his dreams, set forth from the shadowed spires of Camelot.  His quest: to find the lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests haunted by brigands and wild beasts, and over sun-baked plains, he and his loyal squire journeyed, their horses’ hooves drumming a steady rhythm against the unforgiving earth. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to outwitting cunning highwaymen, testing their courage and resolve at every turn.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling unpredictable warp storms tested the limits of both ship and crew. The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering starlight and cold, impenetrable darkness, offered breathtaking beauty alongside the constant threat of the unknown. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
