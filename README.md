
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudged through the mud, the stench of rain-soaked earth and decaying leaves heavy in the air. Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was proving far more arduous than the ancient maps suggested.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected spring floods, and every village held its own unique brand of suspicion and hardship.  Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of Eldoria's fabled treasures – and the glory awaiting a knight who could prove its existence – spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of her ship's bridge.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where rogue asteroids and hostile alien lifeforms posed constant threats. But the potential rewards – a new home for humanity, the expansion of knowledge – outweighed the terrifying risks, and Eva held her course, a lone star in the vast, indifferent darkness.
