
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or worse.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, tempered by the harsh realities of a journey fraught with peril across an unforgiving landscape.  The very air seemed thick with the promise of both glory and death.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and desperate their only guide.  The journey was a symphony of star jumps and navigational calculations, each warp jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Alien landscapes shimmered outside her viewport – iridescent gas giants, asteroid fields glittering like diamonds, and the distant, alluring glow of uncharted planets.  The vastness of space, however, was just as daunting as any medieval wilderness, the solitude a constant companion on her perilous voyage.
