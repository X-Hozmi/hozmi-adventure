
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing a route through the treacherous Black Forest to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  His quest, a desperate search for a cure for his ailing sister, pushed him relentlessly forward, the promise of Eldoria’s legendary healing herbs a beacon in the gathering gloom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, the twinkling constellations a breathtaking but ultimately isolating backdrop.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the risk of encountering unpredictable space anomalies or hostile alien factions.  Yet, the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel – spurred her on, a challenge far exceeding any earthly adventure.
