
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her knapsack, heavy with dried meats and meager supplies, felt like lead.  The whispered tales of the lost city of Ys, shimmering in the legends of her people, fueled her onward despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each creaking cart she passed, each wary villager she encountered, offered a fleeting glimpse into the vast, unpredictable world stretching before her, a tapestry woven with both peril and the tantalizing promise of untold riches or ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through swirling cosmic dust.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been perilous, a gamble against the unpredictable wormholes, but the potential rewards – a fabled planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – were too tempting to ignore.  The vastness of space pressed down on her, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense distances separating her from a comfortable return, yet the thrill of exploration fueled her, a vibrant counterpoint to the quiet hum of the ship's engines.
