Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel bulging with questionable maps and even more questionable provisions.  Each creak of her saddle was a symphony of uncertainty; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient olive groves, and whispers of a mythical lost city fueled her relentless journey. The sting of the sun and the gnawing hunger were small prices to pay for the thrill of discovery, for the chance to unravel the secrets hidden within those crumbling, forgotten lands.

Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.

The vast emptiness of space held a chilling beauty, a stark contrast to the vibrant, unknown worlds that beckoned – worlds promising both wonder and unimaginable peril.
