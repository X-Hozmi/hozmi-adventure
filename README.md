
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely a trail in places, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each crest offered a breathtaking vista, but also a chilling reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked in the shadows.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril, yet promised untold riches and glory – or a gruesome end in some forgotten ravine.  He clutched the King's decree, its wax seal brittle with age, his only guarantee of safe passage across hostile territories.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring vibration against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced not bandits and wild beasts, but the unpredictable whims of the cosmos – radiation storms, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  The treasures they sought weren't gold and jewels, but knowledge – the knowledge that might determine the future of humanity among the stars.
