
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of dust and distant woodsmoke. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching desert. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, forging him into a legend whispered around crackling campfires.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage demanding precise navigation through asteroid fields and treacherous wormholes.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers, from rogue space pirates to unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the thrill of discovering new worlds fueled her, a modern-day adventurer charting a course across the infinite canvas of the cosmos.
