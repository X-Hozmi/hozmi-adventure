
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a whispered promise of a land beyond the endless forests and warring kingdoms. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a reminder of the unforgiving wilderness that lay between her and her destiny. The journey was perilous, but the yearning for a better future fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant thrum that vibrated through the ship's frame, as she charted a course across galaxies, seeking the legendary Xylos system and its rumoured life-giving mineral, Aetherium. The vast distances were daunting, the dangers of cosmic radiation and uncharted asteroid fields a constant worry, but the lure of discovery, the chance to make history, spurred her on.  The universe was a vast, unpredictable ocean, but Jax, like Elara before her, was determined to navigate its treacherous waters.
