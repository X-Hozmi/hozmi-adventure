
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onwards, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience. Yet, the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches spurred her on, each sunrise a new chapter in her perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and enduring the psychological strain of prolonged interstellar travel were all part of a typical week. But for Rexa, the thrill of charting unknown galaxies, uncovering forgotten histories, and facing the vastness of space far outweighed the risks, making every mission a breathtaking odyssey.
