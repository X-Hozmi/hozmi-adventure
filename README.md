
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing daughter.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope for his child fuels his journey, pushing him onward despite the daunting odds and the relentless uncertainty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that will take generations even with their advanced warp drive.  The vast emptiness of space is a different kind of challenge, a lonely expanse punctuated by the occasional rogue asteroid field or the unnerving silence of deep space.   But Eva, steeled by rigorous training and fueled by the unwavering spirit of exploration, steers her ship towards the unknown, facing the cosmic unknown with bravery and a thirst for discovery.
