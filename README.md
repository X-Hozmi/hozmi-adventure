
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sunlight, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered legends of Eldoria's healing powers, coupled with the desperate pleas of his afflicted people, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with impossible colours.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with malfunctioning hyperdrive, Eva and her crew faced dangers far beyond those of any medieval knight.  Alien life forms, temporal anomalies, and the sheer vastness of space itself tested their courage and skill.  Yet, the hope of finding the colonists, of bringing them home, pushed them ever forward, across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
