
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his ribs, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a hazy ochre curtain against the unforgiving sun.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land like a malevolent specter.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the gnawing fear of nightfall in a hostile wilderness.  Their survival depended on courage, cunning, and the unwavering faith that guided their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unpredictable solar flares was commonplace.  More threatening were the whispers of the Kryll, a sentient space-faring species known for their ruthless territoriality.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held the promise of discovery, but also the constant threat of the unknown.  The journey was a gamble, but for Eva, the future of humanity depended on its success.
