
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest, a perilous journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked deserts, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of goblins and wild beasts haunted every rustle of leaves.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, hostile villagers, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows, testing their courage and resilience with every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the Kepler-186f research outpost, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies tested not only her piloting skills but also her nerves of steel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of sparkling stars and swirling cosmic dust, offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the universe.
