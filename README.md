
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the scent of pine and woodsmoke clinging to the crisp air.  Her journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested her resilience. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed determination, each shared meal with fellow travelers a brief respite from the hardships of the road, fueling her spirit for the adventure ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the thrill never faded.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to a newly discovered planet on the far side of the galaxy.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of the warp drive, the crackling of comms chatter from distant stations, and the breathtaking views of celestial wonders unimaginable to medieval travelers.  This wasn't just travel; it was the exploration of a universe teeming with possibilities.
