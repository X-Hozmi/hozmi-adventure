
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Isle of Avalon, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred her onward, her spirit as resilient as the worn leather of her saddlebags.  Every sunrise offered a new challenge, a new chance to draw closer to her desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula known as the Serpent's Eye.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr space pirates, Rexa relied on her crew's ingenuity and her own unwavering courage.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking wonders and terrifying unknowns, but the promise of finding Xylos and bringing its people home fueled her journey across the cosmic ocean.
