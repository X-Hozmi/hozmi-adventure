
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a few dried apricots and a chipped map, but her heart was full of the promise of adventure.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each whispered rumour of bandits and hidden monasteries, added to the tapestry of her journey.  She was bound for Avignon, a city humming with tales of intrigue and opportunity, a pilgrimage fueled by ambition as much as faith.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey had already spanned light-years, each jump a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Yet the allure of discovery outweighed the dangers; the potential to unlock secrets older than time itself was a siren call Jax couldn't resist, even if the price was venturing into the uncharted expanse where legends and nightmares collided.
