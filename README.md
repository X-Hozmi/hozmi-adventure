
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh midday sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Eldoria, rumored to hold artifacts of unimaginable power.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, the whispers of bandits and mythical beasts a constant threat.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains and treacherous mountain passes, each sunrise bringing renewed hope and the ever-present danger of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, vanished without a trace decades ago. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates became commonplace hazards during the interstellar voyage.  The vast emptiness of space was a constant companion, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms system.  Reaching New Eden, if it even existed, meant facing not only the perils of the cosmos, but also the potential horrors that might have befallen its inhabitants.
