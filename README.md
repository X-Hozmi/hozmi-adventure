
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a fragile map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Hildegard.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of the unknown – the chance to uncover secrets lost to time and evade the clutches of the ruthless Duke who sought the scriptures for himself. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the exhilarating uncertainty of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of shimmering gas clouds and distant galaxies, held both wonder and peril.  Alien encounters – both friendly and hostile – were commonplace, and navigating through unstable wormholes demanded nerves of steel and unparalleled piloting skill.  The risk of never returning home was a constant companion, but the lure of the unknown, the potential to discover new worlds and civilizations, overshadowed any fear.
