
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards he’d left behind in Burgundy.  His quest: to recover the lost relic of Saint Fiacre, rumored to be hidden within the crumbling ruins of a forgotten city beyond the Sultan’s borders.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the allure of adventure, and the promise of glory, spurred him onward.  He rode, his loyal steed beneath him, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, held its own perils – asteroid fields, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on interstellar trade routes.  But Eva, hardened by years of exploration, felt the familiar thrill of discovery. The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknown, held the same intoxicating allure as the ancient world, a promise of adventure amongst the stars.
