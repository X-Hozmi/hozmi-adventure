
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume him. But the lure of the unknown, the promise of glory and untold riches, kept his spirit alight, pushing him ever closer to his perilous goal.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vast distances were daunting, the cosmic hazards unpredictable – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life. Yet,  Eva, with her steely gaze fixed on the star-dusted canvas before her, felt the thrill of discovery, a burning desire to push the boundaries of human exploration and claim her place among the galaxy's pioneers.
