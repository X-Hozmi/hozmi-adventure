
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead, a tapestry woven with hardship, but also with the thrilling promise of discovery and glory waiting at journey's end.  He pressed on, driven by a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with danger, the risk of encountering unpredictable spatial anomalies a constant shadow. But the hope of a new beginning, the chance to build a future among the stars, fueled her determination.  Every jump was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the infinite odds of the cosmos.
