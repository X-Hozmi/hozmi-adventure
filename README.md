
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her brother, lost amongst the warring factions of the Iberian Peninsula.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each distant hawk cry, sent a shiver down her spine, a testament to the ever-present danger.  Banditry, starvation, and the harsh elements were as formidable foes as any knight.  Yet, the unwavering glint in her eyes spoke of a determination forged in the crucible of adversity, fueled by the burning need to reunite with her kin.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored haven for rare, energy-rich crystals.  The vast, inky blackness of space held its own perils: unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on lone ships.  But the lure of fortune, and the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, outweighed the risks for Comet and his crew. The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby, promising adventure and the possibility of untold riches – or ruin.
