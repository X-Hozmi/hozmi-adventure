
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each aching mile, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a tapestry woven from whispered legends, bustling market towns, and the quiet solitude of starlit nights under a vast, indifferent sky.  This was adventure, raw and untamed.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a delicate dance of gravitational pulls and hyperspace jumps, each a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet of Aethelred, a world rumored to be teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal alien predators.  The vastness of space, the potential for discovery, and the ever-present risk of catastrophic failure – this was a different kind of adventure, one played out on a scale far beyond the comprehension of those medieval pilgrims, yet fuelled by the same unwavering spirit of exploration.
