
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis of hope in a world consumed by despair, fueled their weary bodies and resolute spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Elara's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of human civilization swallowed by the swirling nebula of the Serpent's Eye.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates was commonplace.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant suns, offered a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of the ship. But the promise of rediscovering Xylos, a lost piece of humanity's past, spurred Elara and her crew onward through the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
