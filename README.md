
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he navigates the treacherous, overgrown track leading towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each day brings new challenges:  bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the relentless gnawing of hunger, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the whispers of Eldoria's untold riches, and the chance to prove his valor, propel him onward, through sun-baked plains and storm-lashed mountains, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the Andromeda Galaxy, its hyperdrive a hum against the deafening silence of space.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging hostile K'tharr cruisers, Eva relies on her crew's skill and cutting-edge technology, a stark contrast to Reginald's medieval struggles. Yet, the same spirit of daring adventure, the same yearning for the unknown, binds them across the chasm of time and technology.
