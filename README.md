
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey across the kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the lonely plains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory against the elements and unseen dangers.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Sunstone city, whispered to hold unimaginable power, spurred her onward, her heart a fierce drum against her ribs.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla Vex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hummed, a constant thrum against the silence of space, as she charted a course to the Andromeda galaxy, a pilgrimage to a rumored lost colony.  While the dangers were less tangible than bandits and beasts – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of void-born creatures – the vastness of space presented its own unique and terrifying uncertainties.  The unknown stretched before her, a breathtaking and horrifying expanse equally captivating and potentially fatal.
