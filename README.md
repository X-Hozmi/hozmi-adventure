
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust kicked up by their hooves painted the already harsh midday sun a fiery orange.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to house both brigands and mythical beasts.  Reginald, bound for the Holy Land on a pilgrimage fraught with peril, clutched the worn, leather-bound book of prayers his mother had given him – his only comfort against the unknown dangers that lay in wait: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present shadow of disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the palpable tension of the journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving distances between worlds.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Eva, gazing out at the breathtaking celestial tapestry, felt the same thrill of the unknown that must have coursed through Reginald's veins centuries ago.
