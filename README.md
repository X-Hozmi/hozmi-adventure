
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she urged her destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness, had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the heart of a land whispered to be haunted. Each day brought the risk of starvation, attack, or simply succumbing to the relentless elements, but the unwavering hope for her brother's healing fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable cosmic canvas.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals to the distant Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hyperspace travel.  The vastness of space held its own perils, from unpredictable asteroid fields and rogue black holes to the ever-present threat of pirate raids. But the promise of astronomical riches and the thrill of charting the unknown spurred him and his crew to continue their perilous voyage across the galaxy.
