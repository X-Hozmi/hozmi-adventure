
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass.  Her worn leather satchel holds a king's ransom, not in gold, but in seeds – rare spices coveted by a distant court.  Bandits lurk in shadows, storms threaten to sweep her from the precipice, and the ever-present gnawing hunger reminds her of the perilous nature of her journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of challenges, a testament to the courage and resilience required for land-based adventure in the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of nebulae swirling in unimaginable colors.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of explored space.  The dangers are different now – alien life forms, treacherous gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – yet the same thrill of exploration, the same sense of isolation and wonder, fuels her journey across the cosmic ocean.
