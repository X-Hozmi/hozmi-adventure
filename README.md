
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried across treacherous mountains and lawless plains to a distant kingdom.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of reaching her destination, of making a difference, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate incursions was child's play compared to the diplomatic minefield that awaited her on Xylos.  The mission: to secure a vital energy source for a failing Earth.  The stakes were infinitely higher than any medieval quest, the dangers far more sophisticated – but the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human reach, fueled her just as fiercely as it had fueled Elara all those years ago.
