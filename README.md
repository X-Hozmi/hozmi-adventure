
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of France, stinging my face as I pressed onward towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  My meager supplies were dwindling, and the whispers of bandits and wild beasts haunted my dreams, but the lure of forgotten magic and untold riches spurred me on. Every sunrise brought a fresh wave of anticipation, a chance to discover something breathtaking, something that would make this arduous journey worthwhile.


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion.  The shimmering nebulae outside the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter* painted a breathtaking canvas across the void.  My mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the occasional passing asteroid field and the distant, cold light of stars, held a different kind of peril than the medieval wilds, a danger both awe-inspiring and utterly terrifying.  But the potential reward, a revolutionary leap for humankind, made every calculated risk worthwhile.
