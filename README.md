
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital grains destined for a famine-stricken village beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential danger: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with each sunrise painting the sky in vibrant hues, Elara pressed on, driven by a purpose stronger than fear, a testament to the unwavering human spirit navigating the perils of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of communications from her crew.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding hostile alien patrols was a far cry from Elara's struggles, but the same courage, the same unyielding resolve, fueled her journey across the vast emptiness of space.  The future held unknown wonders, and Eva, like Elara before her, was determined to find them.
