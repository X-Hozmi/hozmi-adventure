
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the treacherous Whisperwind Moors, a place whispered to be haunted by banshees and shadowed by brigands.  Her quest – to deliver a sacred relic to the monastery at Oakhaven – felt more perilous with each mile, the sun a merciless judge in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Every rustle in the undergrowth, every distant howl, sharpened her senses, pushing her deeper into the heart of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown flora and fauna, a world as alien and unpredictable as the vast emptiness between the stars.  The journey was fraught with dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable space currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but for Ryla, the thrill of exploration outweighed all risk.
