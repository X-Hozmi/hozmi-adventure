
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, barely legible after months of travel, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creaking footstep is a gamble, the path fraught with bandits, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of reaching her destination fuels her onward, a testament to the unwavering courage found in even the most desperate of medieval adventurers.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare element from the gas giant Kepler-186f, vital to powering the intergalactic trade routes.  The journey is fraught with its own dangers – pirate fleets lurking in asteroid fields, unpredictable gravitational currents threatening to tear her ship apart, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But the vast expanse of space holds the same allure as the medieval wilds – the promise of untold riches and discoveries for those brave enough to pursue them.
