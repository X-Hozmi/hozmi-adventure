
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each wary glance at the shadowed forests bordering the path, fueled her resolve.  Bandit raids and treacherous terrain were mere inconveniences compared to the silent terror gripping her homeland.  Reaching her destination meant braving more than just miles; it meant facing fear itself.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas. His mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory K'tharr warships tested his skills and the ship's resilience to the extreme.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the most perilous medieval journey, yet the same thrill of discovery, the same unwavering determination to succeed, burned bright within him.
