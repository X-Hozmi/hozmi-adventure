
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Gareth and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, dense forests teeming with wild beasts, and rivers swollen with spring rains.  Their journey was a constant test of endurance, their resolve forged in the crucible of hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, before a hostile corporation could exploit it.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the unpredictable gravitational forces of wormholes were all in a day's work.  The vast expanse of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also held terrifying unknowns, turning every jump to hyperspace into a gamble with fate.
