
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward. The journey across the ravaged French countryside was arduous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, the lure of the Holy Land, a pilgrimage promised by a dying brother, spurred him on.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge, each sunset brought a renewed sense of wonder at the vastness of the world and the resilience of the human spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in months of hypersleep punctuated by the occasional terrifying jolt of unexpected stellar activity.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space offered a different kind of challenge – the constant hum of the ship's engines, the ever-present risk of equipment failure, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the promise of a new beginning, a new frontier, fueled her resolve.
