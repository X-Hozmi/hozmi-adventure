
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and courage, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every mile. Yet, the whisper of ancient magic and untold riches spurred her onward, each hardship a step closer to her destiny.  The rhythmic clop of hooves against the cobblestones was a constant against the vast, unknown landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue planets with unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of space pirates kept Jaxx and his crew alert.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years, a voyage into the ultimate unknown.
