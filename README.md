
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandit ambush or monstrous beast.  His companions, a grizzled knight and a sharp-tongued scholar, rode close, their faces etched with a mixture of hope and apprehension, mirroring the uncertain journey that stretched before them.  The vast unknown lay between them and their dreams.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship's hull, a constant reminder of the immense distances they were traversing.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the watchful eyes of unknown alien races presented challenges far beyond anything medieval travelers could fathom.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of uncharted worlds, fueled her and her crew’s unwavering resolve.
