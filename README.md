
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with salted meat and meager coin, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost knowledge and unimaginable wealth.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the unpredictable, spurred him on, his spirit unbroken by the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, lost amidst the uncharted expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, a symphony of controlled chaos, as they navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of Earth. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, the challenge of exploring the unknown, ignited a fire in her soul, a fire brighter than any star.
