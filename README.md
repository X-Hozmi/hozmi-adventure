
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the English countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged his village.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs swallowing unsuspecting travelers, and the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey across the land.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering pirate fleets or encountering uncharted, hostile celestial bodies.  But the weight of galactic responsibility, the promise of a unified future, spurred Elara onward through the breathtaking, and often terrifying, expanse of the galaxy.
