
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant shimmer. Her journey from the frozen north has been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of disease.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a fresh test of her resilience and resourcefulness. Yet, the allure of the south, the promise of a life beyond the harsh realities of her northern homeland, fuels her onward.  The whispered legends of sun-drenched vineyards and bustling markets, a stark contrast to her snow-laden reality, keep her hope alive.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the colossal engines of the 'Stardust Drifter' humming a low, resonant thrum.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable worlds for a burgeoning human diaspora. The vast, inky blackness holds both wonder and dread; alien encounters are a constant possibility, ranging from breathtakingly beautiful celestial phenomena to potentially hostile lifeforms. Yet, for Jax, the unparalleled scale of the universe, the chance to discover new beginnings amidst the cosmic expanse, makes the risks worth taking. The future of humanity rests upon these perilous voyages through the unknown.
