
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the muddied ruts of a forgotten Roman road.  Each step was a battle against the relentless downpour, the chill wind a constant reminder of the dangers ahead.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, said to hold the lost scriptures of a forgotten saint, spurred us onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, disease, and the unforgiving wilderness itself.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, every sunset a desperate hope for shelter and survival.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel of chrome and plasma, hurtles through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Captain Elara, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, navigates the treacherous asteroid fields, her crew a diverse collection of xeno-linguists, engineers, and mercenaries.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast emptiness of space is filled not with fear, but the exhilarating thrill of discovery, a potent cocktail of wonder and the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown.
