
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling to their deaths, and the gnawing hunger was a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a flicker of light in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of her ship.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling on the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hyperspace jump had been treacherous, a harrowing dance with gravitational anomalies that threatened to rip her vessel apart.  But the sight of the struggling colony, clinging to life on a distant, alien world, was a reward worth the risk – a testament to human resilience in the face of the daunting, endless expanse of space.
