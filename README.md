In the medieval era, adventure was synonymous with the open road, a world largely uncharted and teeming with both peril and promise. Knights errant, wandering merchants, and curious scholars alike might embark on journeys spanning kingdoms, driven by quests for glory, profit, or ancient knowledge. Leaving the familiar safety of village walls meant stepping into a vast, untamed landscape, where every forest held mysteries and every distant peak hinted at untold stories. This was not a leisure activity, but often a necessity or a calling, a raw test of courage and resourcefulness against the backdrop of a sprawling, unpredictable continent.

Such overland travel was fraught with dangers: bandits lurking in dense woods, treacherous mountain passes, and swollen rivers that demanded ingenuity to cross. Encounters with wild beasts, hostile lords, or even mythical creatures were constant possibilities, making every mile a potential struggle for survival. Yet, for those who braved these hardships, the rewards were immense: the discovery of forgotten ruins, the trade of exotic goods, the forging of unlikely alliances, or the simple wonder of witnessing lands and cultures previously known only through rumour. Each journey was an epic in miniature, a personal saga woven into the fabric of a world still waiting to be fully explored.
