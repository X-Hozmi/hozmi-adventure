
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for a famine-stricken village far beyond the king's reach.  Each creaking step was a gamble against bandits, treacherous paths, and the ever-present threat of winter's relentless grip.  Her journey was not for glory, but for survival, a testament to the grit and determination needed to navigate a medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the Andromeda galaxy, its hyperdrive a shimmering emerald tear in the cosmic tapestry.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, whispered to have mastered interstellar travel centuries before humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and nebulae, dodging pirate vessels and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions, Razor and his crew faced a different kind of perilous journey.  The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but held dangers far exceeding any medieval mountain range.
