
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the desolate landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits had tested her mettle, rivers had challenged her strength, and the endless, unforgiving terrain had threatened to break her spirit. Yet, the legends of Eldoria's shimmering spires and enchanted forests propelled her forward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of emerald and sapphire as his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the ever-widening gap between the two galaxies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading relentless space pirates, and deciphering ancient star charts were merely minor inconveniences in the pursuit of a discovery that could change the fate of two entire galaxies.
