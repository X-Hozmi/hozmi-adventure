
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged Breton countryside as Jean, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Constantinople, seeking a cure for his ailing sister.  The road was a treacherous tapestry of mud, rock, and bandit-infested forests.  Each sunrise brought new dangers –  the threat of starvation, the lurking shadows of brigands, and the ever-present uncertainty of finding safe passage through warring fiefdoms.  But the hope of healing spurred him on, a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was the only sound louder than the frantic thrum of Elara's heart.  She piloted the freighter through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Smuggling a vital bio-engineered seed, Elara faced the constant threat of Imperial patrols and the unforgiving vastness of space itself.  Engine malfunctions, pirate attacks, and the ever-present risk of getting lost in the cosmic ocean were but a few of the perils she faced on this perilous, interstellar journey.  The fate of a dying world rested on her success.
