
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn tunic.  Her journey from York to Constantinople was a tapestry woven with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed hope, the promise of bustling markets and tales whispered around crackling fires, a testament to the indomitable human spirit seeking fortune and adventure across the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling emptiness between worlds.  But Ryla, fuelled by a thirst for discovery far greater than any earthly ambition, pressed onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the thrilling, unpredictable future of interstellar exploration.
