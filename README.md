
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril and resilience, a testament to the unwavering human spirit seeking salvation across a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human exploration across the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
