
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient kings and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new test of his resilience in a world both beautiful and brutal.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile space pirates, and maintaining the ship's fragile life support systems demanded unwavering skill and courage.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic wonders, offered both awe-inspiring beauty and the constant threat of oblivion.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
