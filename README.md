
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the sun bleaching the already parched landscape.  Her worn leather jerkin chafed, a constant reminder of the weeks spent traversing the unforgiving terrain.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispers, a legendary trading hub whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold untold riches and dangers in equal measure. Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation were constant companions on her journey, yet the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, fueled by a spirit as resilient as the ancient stones she passed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant reminder of the colossal distances they were traversing.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were all part of the everyday reality for interstellar travelers. But the potential for discovery, for charting unmapped territories among the stars, outweighed the risks a thousandfold – for Eva, the galaxy was her frontier.
