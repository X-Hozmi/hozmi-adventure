
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each wary glance at the looming mountains, fueled her determination. Bandits, starvation, and the sheer unforgiving nature of the land were constant companions on her perilous journey, yet the whispered tales of Eldoria’s magical remedies kept her pushing onward, a flicker of defiance burning bright against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  The journey was a symphony of hyper-jumps and calculated risks, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the familiar hum of the ship's engines – the only constant in her interstellar odyssey.
