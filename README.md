
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming faintly under the pale sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by malevolent spirits and brigands more ruthless than wolves. His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey that would test his courage, his loyalty, and his endurance across unforgiving landscapes, through muddy tracks and over treacherous mountain passes, relying on the kindness of strangers and the strength of his own sword arm.  Every sunset brought new peril, every sunrise a renewed hope of reaching his destination.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and potentially harboring life-altering technology.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, Elara and her crew faced the vast unknown, their courage fueled by the hope of discovery and the constant threat of unseen dangers lurking between the stars.  Each jump through the cosmos brought them closer to their goal, and potentially, to the edge of the galaxy itself.
