
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, more faded creases than legible ink, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the unknown.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger, but the promise of reaching the rumored monastery at the edge of the known world fueled her onward.  The journey was arduous, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty,  a testament to the human spirit’s capacity for both resilience and reckless hope.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace had been smooth, but the navigation through uncharted asteroid fields was a nerve-wracking dance with destruction.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers bound by a shared thirst for the unknown, were a reassuring presence in the vast, echoing silence of space.  While the challenges of interstellar travel were far removed from the medieval traveler's concerns, the sense of isolation, the risk, and the unwavering determination remained profoundly similar.  The frontier, whether it be a medieval forest or a galactic nebula, held equal parts terror and exhilaration.
