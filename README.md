
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the parched landscape.  Dust devils danced on the horizon as his small band pressed on, their supplies dwindling as fast as their hope.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the desperate need to save their people, propelled them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily routine, the vast emptiness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The advanced technology of her ship offered comfort, yet the isolation and unpredictable nature of interstellar travel meant that danger lurked around every jump gate and behind every unexplored planet.  The fate of a lost colony rested on her shoulders, a weight as heavy as any medieval knight's burden.
