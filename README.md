
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air. Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the promise of Zerzura, and the unwavering love for her brother, fueled her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Warp drives hummed, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational pulls. The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying peril, but the hope of finding Kepler-186f and ensuring her people’s survival pushed Ryla and her crew across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
