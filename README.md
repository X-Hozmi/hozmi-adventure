
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, and the treacherous mountain passes tested both her resilience and her mule's endurance. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new breathtaking vista, a renewed determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the shimmering nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a routine yet breathtaking experience.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, pressed in on her as she charted a course through unmapped regions, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and the thrill of the unknown.
