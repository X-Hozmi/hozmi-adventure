
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onwards through the unforgiving landscape, their journey a desperate gamble against the odds.


Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course charted through the nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Kepler-186f colony was arduous, a test of both ship and crew.  Warp drives flickered, threatening to strand them in the void, while alien anomalies sent shivers down the spines of even the most seasoned explorers.  Yet, the promise of a new beginning on a potentially habitable world, a chance to build a future amongst the stars, outweighed the dangers, fueling their relentless push across the galactic expanse.
