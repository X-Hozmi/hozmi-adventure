He clutched the tattered map, its faded ink promising riches and glory in the distant Sultanate of Delhi.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of exotic lands and unimaginable wealth, propelled him forward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vista of cosmic wonders unfolding outside the viewport.  Challenges remained - unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien factions, the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but Eva's unwavering determination, fueled by humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration, burned brighter than any star.
