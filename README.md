
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the rumors of plague-ridden cities he was leaving behind.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys, fueled him through exhaustion and fear.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Ys’s wonders, spurred him ever closer to his perilous goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of incandescent purple and emerald.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a tapestry of breathtaking celestial phenomena and the constant hum of the ship's warp drive.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace, each encounter a thrilling gamble against the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  But the potential rewards – unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel – far outweighed the risks for Eva and her crew, driving them across the galaxy on the wings of ambition and daring.
