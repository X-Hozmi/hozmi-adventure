
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the ever-present shadow of the Black Death, clinging to the land like a shroud. The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory scans of rival corporations was commonplace.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover new life and unimaginable technologies, outweighed the risks.  This was not just a voyage across space, but a leap into the unknown, a gamble with the very future of humankind.
