
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary mount onward.  The King's summons had sent him across the treacherous Albion countryside, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the whispers of a fearsome dragon guarding a mountain pass fueled his already anxious heart.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the stark reminder of his perilous distance from home.  But the honor of the crown, and the promise of untold riches, kept his spirit alive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vast, inky expanse of space held a beauty that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Eva's journey was less about brute strength and more about calculated risks, technological prowess, and the unwavering spirit of a seasoned explorer pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
