
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she navigates the treacherous, sun-baked trail across the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but the seeds of a new life – seeds promised to a monastery far beyond these unforgiving mountains.  Bandits lurk in shadows, storms threaten to swallow the path whole, and the constant gnawing hunger is a beast as fearsome as any wolf. Yet, the hope of reaching her destination fuels her weary steps, each sunrise a fresh gamble in this grand, perilous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of rare minerals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  Cosmic radiation crackles against the hull, and the vast, indifferent emptiness of space presses in. But Eva’s courage is tempered by years spent pushing the boundaries of human exploration, and the reward - a breakthrough in faster-than-light travel – makes the risk worthwhile. The galaxy is her canvas, and she its bold adventurer.
