
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any promised divine grace.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing hunger of empty bellies and the unsettling knowledge that survival hinged on their wits, their strength, and a generous helping of luck.  The whispered tales of mythical beasts and enchanted forests only added to the mystique – and the danger – of their arduous trek.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was no less perilous.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, the constant threat of pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the chilling isolation of deep space tested her crew's resolve. The vastness of the cosmos held both unimaginable beauty and the terrifying potential for annihilation; every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
