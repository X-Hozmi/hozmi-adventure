
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary in a distant abbey rumored to offer refuge from the creeping plague.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing fear of the unseen illness itself.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara found renewed resolve, driven by the unwavering spirit of survival that defined this age of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the shimmering blue nebula swirling outside the cockpit windows of his starship *Stardust*.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Xylos system, a treacherous cluster of planets riddled with hostile alien life and unpredictable gravitational fields.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful expanse of swirling colours and cosmic wonders, offered both incredible opportunities and unimaginable dangers. The journey was a gamble, a test of skill and courage in a future where interstellar exploration was as common, yet as deadly, as medieval pilgrimage.
