The breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes, from crimson sunsets on Kepler-186f to the crystalline oceans of Proxima Centauri b, was offset by the constant danger of encountering hostile alien species and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  The rewards, however – potential scientific breakthroughs and the expansion of human knowledge – made every risk worthwhile.
