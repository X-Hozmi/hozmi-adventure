
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a daunting but necessary passage on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, holds the potential for bandit ambush or the chilling whisper of a desert wraith.  Her quest – to deliver a sacred relic – demands courage, resilience, and a faith that transcends the harsh realities of the medieval world.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hum, a constant thrum against the silence of deep space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  But the vastness of the cosmos presents its own perils – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  The journey tests not only her piloting skills but her resolve in the face of unimaginable distances and unknown dangers.
