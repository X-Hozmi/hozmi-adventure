
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, urged his weary steed onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, a swirling prelude to the vast, unknown expanse of the Saracen lands.  His quest: to recover a sacred relic stolen from his abbey, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim reminder of the miles still to traverse before he could hope to return home, a hero or a corpse.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar space were all part of the daily routine.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion on her odyssey, a reminder of the unimaginable distances separating her from Earth and the potential rewards, or devastating losses, that awaited her at journey's end.
