
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless sun.  Each creak of her saddle was a reminder of the arduous journey ahead – a pilgrimage to Constantinople, a city whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air, yet the hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, through sun-baked valleys and over treacherous mountain passes.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black of intergalactic space.  Navigation was a delicate dance between wormholes and hyperlanes, each jump a gamble against unforeseen celestial anomalies.  Her crew, a motley mix of xenobiologists and seasoned navigators, were bound for Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of the cosmos, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, stretched endlessly before them, a constant reminder of the immense risks and potential rewards of their expedition.
