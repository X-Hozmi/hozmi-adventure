Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested her courage and resilience daily. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new hope – and the chilling uncertainty of what lay ahead.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by ancient, sentient flora.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the dangers remained: unpredictable space anomalies, pirate raiders, and the sheer vastness and unforgiving nature of the cosmos.  Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
