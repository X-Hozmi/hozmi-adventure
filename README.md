
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Blackwood, a journey fraught with peril, where every rustling bush held the potential for ambush and every ford threatened to sweep her away.  Survival depended on her wits, her courage, and the unpredictable kindness of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child’s play compared to the cryptic clues left by the colonists, hinting at a terrifying secret hidden within the planet’s core.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a lonely and unforgiving mistress, demanding precision and unwavering resolve.
