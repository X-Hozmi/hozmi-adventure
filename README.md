
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elias's worn boots pounded the rutted track, his pack heavy with meager supplies.  He’d traded his father's meager inheritance for a mule and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brought the looming threat of bandits, unpredictable weather, and the gnawing hunger that tested his resolve more than any dragon ever could.  Yet, with every distant mountain range crested, every unfamiliar village encountered, the thrill of the unknown propelled him onward, a knight errant of fortune rather than glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien patrols.  The vastness of space, a canvas of glittering stars and silent nebulas, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  But the weight of her crew's hopes, and the promise of discovery beyond human imagining, pushed her ever forward, a modern-day explorer driven by curiosity rather than gold.
