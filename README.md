He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing a route to the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on his perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

The promise of discovering new life, charting unexplored territories, and expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos outweighed the inherent dangers, making each jump through hyperspace a thrilling leap into the great unknown.
