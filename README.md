
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Elara’s caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wooden wheels a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves.  Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had already tested their endurance. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the lure of adventure, the possibility of glory and discovery, spurred them onward across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly predators.  Warp drives hummed, the ship shuddering slightly as it jumped between star systems, each jump a leap of faith across unimaginable distances. The vast emptiness of space, the constant threat of pirate raids and unforeseen celestial events, made this interstellar journey exponentially more dangerous than any medieval expedition, yet the promise of galactic progress propelled her and her crew further into the unknown.
