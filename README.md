
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the caravan as it lumbered across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic creak of wagon wheels a counterpoint to the wind's mournful song.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the harsh light, squinted towards the distant, hazy mountains.  This journey to the fabled city of Zerzura promised riches beyond imagining, but also held the perils of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creaking mile was a gamble, a testament to the courage and desperation that fueled this medieval quest.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways.  Captain Elara Jax, aboard the starship *Stardust Drifter*, navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for a fractured human federation.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, and the potential dangers – hostile alien species, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the crushing weight of loneliness – were far greater than anything faced by medieval travelers.  But the pursuit of knowledge and survival pushed her onward, into the vast emptiness between worlds.
