
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the Black Death itself.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, was fraught with peril, demanding cunning, resilience, and a stubborn refusal to yield to the encroaching shadows of the plague and the treacherous terrain.  Her only companions were her worn map, a faithful hunting dog, and the unwavering hope for safe passage.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the Andromeda Galaxy was notoriously treacherous, demanding precise calculations and an unflappable nerve in the face of unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare element crucial for sustaining life on her home planet.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a testament to the boundless, unpredictable nature of interstellar travel.
