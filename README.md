
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambushes or the wrath of nature itself.  Her journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward, her heart pounding a rhythm as relentless as the mule's hooves on the rocky path.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet"  Ryder piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential new colony for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unknown planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth.  But the vastness of space, the glittering tapestry of stars, and the promise of discovery fueled their tireless journey across the galaxy, a far cry from the dusty trails of medieval adventurers, yet similarly driven by a thirst for the unknown.
