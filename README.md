
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  He carried a king's writ, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged castle far to the east.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship – bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his destination, fueled by a mixture of duty and the flickering hope of a king's reward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in generations of cryosleep.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the hypnotic beauty of distant stars and the occasional shiver of warp-drive, held a different kind of peril – the unseen cosmic anomalies, the threat of pirate raiders, and the ever-present loneliness of deep space exploration.  But the lure of the unknown, the promise of new worlds, drove her onward.
