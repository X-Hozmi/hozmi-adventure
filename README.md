
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide to the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step of the mule, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for both peril and wonder – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous pilgrimage.  The journey is relentless, yet the hope of Eldoria's healing powers keeps her spirit alight.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfire" Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  This isn't a quest for mere survival, but a mission to chart unknown territories, to uncover the secrets of a galaxy teeming with wonders and dangers.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the abyss, but the thrill of discovery, the promise of encountering new life, fuels her unwavering determination. The vastness of space, while terrifying, is a siren's call she can't resist.
