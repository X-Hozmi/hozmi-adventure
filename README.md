The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the whispering pines, each turn promising both peril and wonder.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous ravines, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were just some of the obstacles in his quest to reach the mythical Sunstone City, rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing queen.
