
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed ravines, and the vast expanse itself threatened with thirst and starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and constantly watching for the telltale signs of approaching storms.  The allure of Samarkand, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches, fueled her onward, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through a nebula of vibrant colours, its swirling gases a breathtaking but dangerous obstacle.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  The vast distances between stars demanded meticulous planning and unwavering courage, facing unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light years from any rescue.  The cosmos, though beautiful, was a harsh mistress, but the promise of discovery spurred Eva and her crew to push the boundaries of human exploration.
