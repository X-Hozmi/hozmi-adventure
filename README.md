
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's summons had promised riches and glory, but the journey to the distant Sultan's court felt endless.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the changing landscapes: dense forests yielding to sun-baked deserts, the constant threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in their bellies a more immediate danger than any Sultan.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a steely resolve forged in the crucible of hardship and the promise of adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Starseeker', its sleek hull gleaming under the twin suns of Kepler-186f.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, had taken months, a blur of hyperspace jumps and meticulously charted star lanes.  Despite the advanced technology, the vastness of space instilled a primal fear, a humbling sense of insignificance against the backdrop of swirling nebulae and distant galaxies.  The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed any apprehension, fueled by the hope of discovering something that would change the destiny of humankind.
