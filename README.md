
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored monastery, said to hold the lost scrolls of St. Fiacre, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oak trees, and the mountain passes were treacherous, each step a gamble against the elements.  But the whisper of forgotten knowledge fueled her weary limbs, promising a reward beyond the ache in her bones.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a breathtaking distraction from the perilous jump to the Kepler-186f system.  Her mission: to locate the rumored Xylarion crystals, a source of near-limitless energy capable of solving the Galactic Federation's looming energy crisis.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a lonely and dangerous expanse, filled with unpredictable wormholes, pirate factions, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  The galaxy held untold wonders and unimaginable dangers, and Eva was prepared to face them all.
