
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald’s warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his back.  The quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, whispered to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, holds the potential for bandit ambush or a chance encounter with a hermit harboring ancient wisdom.  The road is long, fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fuels his weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Each jump through hyperspace brings the risk of encountering treacherous gravitational anomalies or hostile alien races.  The vast emptiness of space is a lonely companion, but the lure of discovery, the possibility of unraveling the universe's secrets, keeps her ever pushing forward, charting a course across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
