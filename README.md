
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a jostling mass of pack animals and weary travelers, crawls across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We’ve faced brigands, skirted treacherous mountain passes, and braved the wrath of a desert storm.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the promise of Zerzura's legendary riches and untold secrets fuels our onward push, a fragile flame against the overwhelming vastness of the unknown.

Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faintest stellar whispers, charting a course through unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by silence decades ago.  The vast emptiness of space, peppered with the breathtaking beauty of cosmic phenomena, hides dangers far more insidious than any desert bandit – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the crushing weight of isolation, all threatening to extinguish their hope before they even reach their destination.
