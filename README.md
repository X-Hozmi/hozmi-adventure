
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork of weary oxen and even wearier men, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the swirling anxieties in our hearts.  Rumors of bandits, of scorching deserts, and of the city itself – a shimmering mirage of wealth and danger – fuel our journey. Each sunrise brings the promise of discovery,  each sunset the threat of the unknown, a gamble played out under the indifferent gaze of the medieval sky.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter*, my starship, cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  The swirling colours, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust and dying stars, are a far cry from the dusty plains of my ancestors.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey across light years that demands more than courage; it requires unwavering faith in the hyperdrive and the resilience to face the unpredictable dangers of deep space, from rogue asteroids to sentient nebulae.  The adventure is different, but the thrill of the unknown remains constant.
