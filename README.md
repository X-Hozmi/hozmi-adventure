
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to a rumored land of plenty across the treacherous mountains. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, whispered tales of both danger and possibility. Bandits, starvation, and the relentless chill of the approaching winter were constant companions, yet the glint of a distant sunlit valley fueled her onward, a promise of a better tomorrow.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unknown.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the complex politics of alien civilizations were commonplace hazards. The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos fueled her drive. The challenges were immense, but the potential rewards, a new home for humanity amongst the stars, made the risk worthwhile.
