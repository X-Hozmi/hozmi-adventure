
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had become a desperate race against both time and the encroaching shadows of the Hundred Years' War.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the lure of the distant cathedral spires spurred them onward, a beacon of faith and hope against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a remote research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with strange, bioluminescent flora.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of the galaxy, both terrifying and exhilarating, mirrored the boundless ambition driving Eva and her crew across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
