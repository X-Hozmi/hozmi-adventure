
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the hope of a reunion, but also the gnawing fear of never reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a rapidly expanding human civilization.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril; the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars, the constant threat of asteroid fields, and the unnerving silence of the void tested her crew's mettle.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of new worlds and unimaginable knowledge, spurred them onward, across the unimaginable distances between stars.
