Their journey across the ravaged French countryside was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the villages, and the ever-present threat of a sudden storm promised to turn the already treacherous paths into impassable bogs.

Navigating the treacherous cosmic currents between galaxies was far removed from the dusty tracks of old, but the risks remained: rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  While technology offered unprecedented speed and protection, the vastness of space instilled a profound sense of isolation and vulnerability, making each successful jump to a new star system a testament to both skill and sheer courage.
