
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her meager pack heavy with supplies.  This wasn't a pilgrimage to a holy site; this was a desperate flight.  Rumors of a hidden city, rich with forgotten knowledge and rumored magical artifacts, had lured her from her village, a desperate gamble against the famine gripping the land.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both thrilling discovery and mortal danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant threats on her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glare of Xylos reflected in the viewport of her starship.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her home world.  Faster-than-light travel masked the vastness of space, but the risks remained.  Pirate raids were commonplace, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel meant a single miscalculation could strand her crew lightyears from help, lost in the silent, inky expanse between the stars.
