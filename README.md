
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's desperate hope – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the bitter knowledge that the road ahead remained long and treacherous.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI humming a soothing counterpoint to the crackle of warp drive.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth and shrouded in mystery.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure, all adding to the thrilling, perilous nature of her interstellar voyage.
