
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, spurred by rumors of a lost city overflowing with gold and ancient knowledge, trudged across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Their horses, lean and exhausted, stumbled onward, driven by the same thirst for adventure and riches that consumed their human companions.  The vastness of the unknown lay before them, a tapestry woven with peril and the tantalizing promise of untold rewards.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her crew a diverse collection of explorers and scientists charting unmapped galaxies.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between days and weeks, as they navigated asteroid fields, dodged hostile alien patrols, and braved the unpredictable gravitational forces of black holes.  The quest for new life, new civilizations, and new discoveries fueled their journey across the cosmos, a far cry from the medieval treks of their ancestors, yet driven by the same fundamental human desire to explore the great unknown.
