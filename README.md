
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, more a collection of faded scribbles than a precise guide, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions on this pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, and a renewed hope for the sanctity she sought at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rendar piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a rumoured paradise teeming with undiscovered lifeforms and potentially lucrative resources.  The journey, however, was fraught with peril; pirate fleets lurked in the shadows of asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps kept even the most seasoned captains on edge.  The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the risks.
