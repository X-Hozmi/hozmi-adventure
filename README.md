
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Their journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over; rumors of bandits and treacherous terrain lay ahead.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a stark contrast to the quiet determination etched on her face.  She carried with her not gold or jewels, but a vital message, its safe delivery a matter of life and death for her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colors, a breathtaking panorama visible only from hyperspace, masked the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational currents.  His mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on him, a constant reminder of the perilous, yet exhilarating, nature of his interstellar voyage.
