
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and endurance, as they traversed a land both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.  Their destination felt less like a geographical point and more a distant glimmer of hope on the horizon.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying;  the risk of encountering unknown celestial phenomena or hostile alien life forms was ever-present.  Yet, driven by the insatiable human curiosity to explore the unknown,  Eva pressed on, guided by the faint signals of distant stars, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking and unpredictable future.
