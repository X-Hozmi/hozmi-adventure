
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new trials – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume him before he reached his destination. Yet, the glint of hope in Eldoria’s rumored healing waters spurred him on, pushing him deeper into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Lyra, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps across light years brought terrifying moments of disorientation, while asteroid fields and hostile alien patrols tested her piloting skills to their limits.  But the thought of reuniting with the Lyrans, and perhaps discovering new wonders of the universe, fueled her journey across the uncharted expanse of space.
