
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wagon wheels a mournful counterpoint to the distant clang of blacksmiths in a barely-visible village.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother’s wasting disease.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of finding salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of celestial wonders, but also presented terrifying unknowns – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the chilling silence of interstellar space.  The weight of humanity's future rested on her shoulders as she navigated the cosmic ocean, a lone explorer charting a course towards a new dawn.
