
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death itself shadowed every mile.  He carried with him not just a sword and shield, but the hope of a kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the immense distances separating her from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all part of the journey. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of terror than the medieval wilds – the unimaginable scale of the unknown, and the lonely isolation of interstellar travel.
