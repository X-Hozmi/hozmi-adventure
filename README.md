
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint-Gilles, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing his plague-stricken village.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog in the passing caravan was a testament to the perils of the journey – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in fairytale.  He pressed on, spurred by hope and the weight of his people's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital terraforming data from the Kepler-186f colony, a planet light-years from Earth, before a looming solar flare rendered it inaccessible.  The jump gates hummed, spitting her ship into the unknown expanse between galaxies, a chilling reminder of the vastness and unforgiving nature of space.  Each asteroid dodged and each navigational recalibration brought her closer to her objective – and further from the comforting familiarity of home.
