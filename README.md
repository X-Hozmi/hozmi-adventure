
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his beast, was a testament to the arduous adventure unfolding.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes were commonplace hazards.  But the true adventure lay in the unknown – the possibility of discovering new life, charting unmapped galaxies, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration to a scale their medieval predecessors could scarcely imagine.
