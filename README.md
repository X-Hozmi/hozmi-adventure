Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, sent a shiver down his spine – a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the untamed wilds of medieval Europe.

The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling indifference of distant stars, held both immense beauty and terrible unknown dangers.
