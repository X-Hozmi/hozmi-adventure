
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights urged their weary steeds onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Saint Fiacre, a relic said to cure the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or the deadly chill of the plague itself.  Their journey was a desperate gamble against time and the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards, but the true threat lay in the unknown – the unpredictable nature of warp travel and the possibility of encountering alien life forms, both benevolent and malevolent, in the vast expanse of the cosmos.
