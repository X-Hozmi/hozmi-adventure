
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the Black Death, whispered about in hushed tones in every village she passed.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery on the edge of the known world, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother. The journey was fraught with peril, yet the hope of salvation spurred her onward, each sunrise a renewed pledge to continue her arduous pilgrimage across the unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts were useless in this uncharted region of the Andromeda galaxy; she relied on instinct and the cryptic whispers of her ancient star-compass.  The mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to solve the intergalactic energy crisis.  Asteroids grazed their hull, and unknown alien lifeforms pulsed ominously on their scanners. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover something never before seen by human eyes, fueled her unwavering determination to complete her mission, a journey far removed from medieval struggles, but similarly fueled by courage and the pursuit of a vital goal.
