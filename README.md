
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, turning the journey from a simple pilgrimage into a desperate race against time and the elements.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the unforgiving wilderness she dared to traverse.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ry" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, silent expanse of space.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a perilous task requiring precise maneuvering and nerves of steel.  The potential rewards were immense – knowledge that could unlock faster-than-light travel for all humankind – but the risks, from rogue asteroids to hostile alien lifeforms, were equally daunting.
