
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky. Her worn map, more faded prayer than guide, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of brigands and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through her, fueling the relentless push towards the distant, fabled city promised in whispered legends. The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, breathtaking beauty, and the unwavering hope of finding something more than the bleak existence she'd left behind.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos system, the crimson glow of Xylos Prime painting the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter* in an eerie light.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space still held an awe-inspiring terror.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the potential for navigational errors, rogue asteroids, or worse – hostile alien encounters.  But the lure of the unexplored galaxies, the promise of new worlds and untold riches, far outweighed the risks for Jax and his crew, driving them further into the cosmic expanse.
