
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of the Black Death.  Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled her onward, a thrill coursing through her veins that eclipsed any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Cluster, rumored to contain a source of limitless energy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political intrigue and intergalactic rivalries that threatened her mission.  Each jump into hyperspace held the promise of unimaginable discovery, but also the chilling possibility of encountering hostile alien species or catastrophic engine failure in the uncaring expanse of deep space. The galaxy was her playground, but survival was a constant gamble.
