
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the tales of opulent cities and mythical beasts whispered in taverns along the way.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral to seek a cure for his ailing sister, felt less a journey of faith and more a brutal test of endurance, each league a victory against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues of gas and dust painted a breathtaking canvas across the viewport, a far cry from the muddy tracks of Thomas's journey. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage spanning unimaginable distances and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, fueled her every decision, a legacy echoing the unwavering spirit of medieval pilgrims like Thomas.
