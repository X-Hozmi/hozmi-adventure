
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the gleam of Eldoria's promised salvation, and the unwavering loyalty of his companions, fueled their weary steps across the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and treacherous alliances she had to navigate amongst the various spacefaring empires. The journey was perilous, but the potential reward – a galaxy united – made every risk worthwhile.
