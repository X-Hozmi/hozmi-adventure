
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band rode, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust that swirled around them like vengeful spirits.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unseen.  The journey was as much a test of endurance as it was a search for salvation, a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to persevere against overwhelming odds.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, its hyperdrive humming a lullaby of unimaginable speed as they leaped between galaxies. Their mission: to locate a new habitable planet for a dying Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the political machinations of alien civilizations proved far more perilous than any earthly landscape.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested not only their technology but also their courage, their resilience, and their hope for a future among the stars.
