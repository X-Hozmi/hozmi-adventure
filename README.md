
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her small band of travellers, a motley crew bound by a shared thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura, pressed onward. Each creak of their pack animals, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and wonder – a bandit ambush, a hidden oasis, or perhaps a glimpse of the mythical griffin said to guard the city's approaches.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the veil of a nebula, its hyperdrive a humming heart against the vast, silent canvas of space.  Bound for the Xylos system, a rumored haven for ancient technology, her crew navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The thrill wasn't just in the destination; it was in the breathtaking beauty of uncharted galaxies, the thrill of discovering new lifeforms, and the constant challenge of navigating the unpredictable currents of interstellar travel.  The cosmos, both magnificent and terrifying, offered a freedom and adventure unimaginable to their medieval counterparts.
