
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was proving arduous – bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the relentless sun baked the earth until it cracked like a parched throat.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: fording treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and constantly watching for signs of the Black Death's advance.  Yet, the lure of untold riches, and perhaps even glory, spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's reach across the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f was routine, a fleeting moment of disorientation followed by the breathtaking sight of a crimson sun setting over alien oceans.  But this mission was far from routine;  rumors of a long-lost civilization, whispers of forbidden technology, beckoned from the planet's emerald jungles.  Eva knew the risks: unpredictable alien fauna, hostile indigenous life, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions. Yet, the promise of discovery fueled her insatiable hunger for the unknown.
