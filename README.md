
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat and a chipped map, her only companions the relentless sun and the ever-present threat of bandits.  This journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was a gamble against both nature and human cruelty, a test of endurance and resilience under the unforgiving gaze of a medieval sky. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and deadly peril.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of the ship.  Her mission: to traverse the Andromeda galaxy, charting unmapped star systems and searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was also isolating. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reminder of the fragile bubble of human ingenuity protecting them from the unforgiving expanse, a journey far removed from the dangers of the medieval age yet still fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.
