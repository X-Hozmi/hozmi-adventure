
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map promising a hidden monastery said to contain ancient healing secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the promise of bandits, wild animals, or worse—the inquisitors, hunting those who dared to stray from the Church's rigid doctrine.  Her adventure was a gamble with life itself, a desperate race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the crackling static of comms as she navigated treacherous asteroid fields and dodged the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets.  This was not a quest for gold or religious relics, but for the very survival of humanity, a perilous journey into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos, a gamble on a future among the stars.
