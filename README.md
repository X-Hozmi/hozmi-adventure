
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, ever watchful for bandits and the ever-present threat of famine.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers, from disease-ridden villages to the whispers of monstrous creatures lurking in the dark forests.  Yet, the allure of distant markets, legendary cities, and untold riches fuels our weary steps, pushing us onward towards the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', jumps between nebulae, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated efficiency of the navigation system.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the void, where rogue asteroids and unforeseen gravitational anomalies could spell disaster. We traverse galaxies, charting unmapped territories and encountering alien civilizations, some welcoming, others... less so.  The pursuit of knowledge, the thrill of discovery, and the enduring human desire to explore the infinite expanse of space fuels our interstellar voyage.
