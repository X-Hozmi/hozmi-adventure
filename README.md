
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering faintly in the distance.  Her journey from the frozen north has been fraught with peril – brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the promise of sanctuary in the papal city, a chance to escape the encroaching plague that ravaged her village, fuels her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each aching muscle, is a testament to the arduous, unpredictable nature of medieval travel – a constant gamble against the elements and the malice of man.

Alternatively, imagine the sleek, obsidian hull of the 'Starseeker' slicing through the inky void, its engines a low hum against the backdrop of a thousand glittering nebulae.  Captain Ryla navigates by the constellations of a far-flung galaxy, charting a course through asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous gravitational pull of dying stars.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, eagerly anticipate reaching Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next giant leap. Unlike the limitations of medieval travel, they face challenges of cosmic proportions – the threat of rogue black holes, the potential for alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light-years from home.
