
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – rare, drought-resistant barley destined for a famine-stricken village hundreds of leagues away.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse – but the hope in those seeds spurred her onward, a beacon brighter than any castle torch.  The journey was perilous, but the reward, the chance to ease suffering, fueled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* sliced through the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, she relied not on mule and map, but on sophisticated sensors and the unwavering guidance of her AI co-pilot, Zephyr. Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.  The risks were cosmic – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters – yet the possibility of reuniting with a lost civilization pushed them further into the inky blackness.
