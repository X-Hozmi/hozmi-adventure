
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the ever-present stench of his own sweat and the lingering memory of roasted mutton from their last meager meal.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles compared to the hope that burned in his heart. Each sunrise offered a new challenge, a new test of endurance, but the promise of Eldoria kept his spirit alight.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new home for humanity, light years away from a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the constant hum of the ship’s hyperdrive were the daily realities of her interstellar voyage.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the monumental gamble they were taking in their search for a new dawn.  But the potential for a new beginning fueled her determination, guiding her ship through the inky blackness.
