
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the hope of discovering the truth behind the legends.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Wormholes, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations were the hazards she faced, her courage tempered by the weight of her crew's lives and the potential to rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.
