
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork of weary horses and even wearier men, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We’re bound for the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the unforgiving wrath of nature.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of glory, drives us onward, a stubborn speck against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cuts through the inky blackness, a tiny beacon against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is measured not in days, but in years, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the breathtaking beauty of nebulae.  The risks are far different – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, the terrifying unknown of alien life – but the spirit of adventure, that primal urge to explore, burns as brightly as ever.
