Her journey from Avignon to Constantinople was a tapestry woven with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where a single misstep meant oblivion, and the constant threat of disease and starvation.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward. She carried a vital message, a secret pact between warring kingdoms, a chance for peace – a reward worth facing any hardship.  The rough track stretched before her, an endless ribbon promising both danger and the thrilling unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of dying stars was child's play compared to the political machinations and the potential for sabotage she faced.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of untold knowledge, and the potential to rewrite the history of humankind pushed her and her crew to brave the vast, unforgiving emptiness between worlds.
