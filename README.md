
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's retinue plodded across the sun-baked plains. Their journey to the Sultan's court was a grueling tapestry of hardship; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the relentless sun beat down upon them with merciless intensity. Each day brought the promise of danger, from skirmishes with rival knights to the gnawing threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the Sultan's untold riches, coupled with the whispered rumors of mythical artifacts, spurred them onward, their resolve hardened by the shared peril of the long road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, but the dangers remained.  Pirate incursions were a constant threat, and navigating the treacherous gravitational fields of unexplored star systems demanded nerves of steel and unwavering precision.  The mission to locate the legendary Xylossian Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy, held the potential for galactic prosperity, but the journey across the vast emptiness of space was a lonely and hazardous endeavor, pushing both ship and crew to their absolute limits.
