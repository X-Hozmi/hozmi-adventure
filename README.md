
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her weathered face.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step of her mount was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, pushing her deeper into the wild, untamed heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, the vast emptiness of space a constant companion.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the tendrils of space anomalies demanded not only skill, but unwavering nerve.  Yet, the potential for a galaxy-altering discovery pushed Ryla and her crew further into the unknown, a testament to humanity’s insatiable curiosity and relentless pursuit of the extraordinary.
