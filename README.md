
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage promised to a dying friend, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept even the bravest knights awake at night.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering hope for her friend's soul propelled her across the treacherous terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of his ship's engines painting streaks across the cosmic canvas. His mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet clinging precariously to the edge of habitable space.  Wormhole jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made each leg of the journey a gamble.  But the knowledge that lives depended on his safe arrival spurred him on, a modern-day knight errant battling the dangers of the vast, uncaring universe.
