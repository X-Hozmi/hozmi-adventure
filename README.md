
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed determination, fuelled by hope and the whispered legends of shimmering oasis and forgotten magic.  The journey was a tapestry woven with peril and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to a newly discovered planet orbiting a distant sun.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of space pirates became commonplace. The vastness of the cosmos, a breathtaking spectacle of celestial wonders, offered both awe and isolation. Yet, the possibility of bringing life to a barren world, of expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy, drove her and her crew onward, forging a path across the unimaginable distances of space.
