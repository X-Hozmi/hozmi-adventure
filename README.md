
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim possibility of failure, yet the hope of Eldoria spurred him on, a flickering candle in the vast, unforgiving darkness of the medieval world.  He was a speck of humanity against a backdrop of ancient forests and sprawling kingdoms.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of anti-matter to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and repairing vital systems under the relentless pressure of time were her everyday concerns.  Unlike Thomas, Eva possessed advanced technology, but the vastness of space presented its own brand of terrifying uncertainty – the silent expanse of the void a more daunting adversary than any medieval bandit. The journey was a race against the clock across the tapestry of the cosmos.
