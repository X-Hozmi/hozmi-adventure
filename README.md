
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the chilling uncertainty of the unknown wilderness stretching before them.  The allure of Zerzura, however, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded on the far side of the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigation was treacherous, dodging asteroid fields and navigating uncharted space lanes.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her crew. But the faint, persistent signal from Kepler-186f—a beacon of hope in the infinite darkness—kept them pushing forward, across unimaginable distances, towards a destiny unknown.
