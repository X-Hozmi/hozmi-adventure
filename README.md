
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she navigates the treacherous, unmarked paths of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the seed of a rebellion, whispered promises of freedom for her oppressed village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain are constant companions on this perilous journey across the kingdoms, a desperate gamble for a future she can barely imagine.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Vance pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across a dozen planets lightyears apart.  The hyperdrive hums a hypnotic tune against the backdrop of cosmic radiation, a stark counterpoint to the urgent beeps of the navigational system.  Facing down hostile alien patrols and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields, Rexx pushes the limits of his ship and his courage, driven by a desperate hope to find the remnants of humanity's forgotten past.
