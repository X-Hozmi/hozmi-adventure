
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, rumored home to both untold riches and terrifying beasts.  His meager supplies – dried meat, a waterskin, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between him and the unknown.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a potent mix of fear and exhilaration fueling his journey towards the legendary lost city of Eldoria.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  While her journey lacked the immediate physical dangers of Thomas's, the risks were equally profound – malfunctioning engines, hostile alien life, or the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy, spurred her onwards.
