
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from easy.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each arduous mile, Elara's resolve strengthened, fueled by faith and the thrill of the unknown that lay ahead, a testament to the enduring human spirit facing the challenges of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were far from extinct.  Uncharted wormholes, hostile alien fleets, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction made every interstellar voyage a gamble. But Jax, a seasoned explorer, relished the risks, the lure of discovering new worlds and ancient civilizations a siren song that echoed through the void.
