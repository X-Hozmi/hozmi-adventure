
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already traversed.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to me, a constant companion on this pilgrimage across the ravaged countryside.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and rumors of plague-ridden villages fueled the fear that gnawed at my resolve. Yet, the allure of the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and by crackling fires, spurred me onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.  My meager possessions – a worn map, a rusty sword, and a heart full of hope – were all I needed to face whatever lay ahead.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the vast gulf between galaxies.  The starfield outside, a kaleidoscope of nebulae and distant suns, was a breathtaking sight even after countless jumps.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the uncharted sectors after a catastrophic warp storm.  The risks were immense – rogue space pirates, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  But the potential rewards – the chance to reunite a fractured civilization – were worth risking everything, even if it meant navigating the treacherous currents of the cosmic sea alone.
