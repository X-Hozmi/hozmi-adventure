
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already conquered.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as I navigated the treacherous, overgrown path, my trusty steed, a swaybacked mare named Bess, struggling beside me.  Bandits, rumored to lurk in these shadowed forests, were a constant worry, but the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, propelled me onward. The journey was arduous, filled with unpredictable weather, perilous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting vibration against the cold metal of my cabin.  Peering out at the swirling nebula outside, the vast tapestry of space a breathtaking canvas, I thought of those medieval travelers.  Our destinations were worlds apart, yet the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, the relentless pull towards the horizon—be it earthly or cosmic—remained a constant.  This journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, was just as perilous, albeit in different ways; radiation storms, asteroid fields, and the ever-present chance of engine failure replacing bandits and treacherous terrain.  The unknown always beckoned, regardless of era.
