
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  But the unwavering glint in her eye spoke of a determination to overcome any obstacle, a testament to the enduring human spirit against the backdrop of a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of nascent stars was routine, but the loneliness of interstellar travel weighed heavier than any physical threat.  Yet, the thought of those colonists, clinging to life on an unknown planet, fueled her engine's hum and pushed her ever onward, across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
