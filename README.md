
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the constant threat of illness hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, forging Gareth's resolve with every league traversed across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  With each jump, the crew faced the risk of spatial distortion or encountering unknown celestial anomalies, but the promise of discovery fueled their courage in this vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
