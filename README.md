
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cacophony of cries and the stench of unwashed bodies a far cry from the crisp mountain air we now breathed.  Weeks bled into months as we traversed the rough, unpredictable terrain – bandits a constant threat, rivers swollen and treacherous, and the ever-present gnawing hunger a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers and the bittersweet beauty of untamed landscapes, from the rolling hills of France to the sun-baked plains of Italy.  Our destination, the Holy Land, felt as distant and unattainable as the stars themselves.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's warp drive was a constant lullaby against the vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos.  Our destination: Xylos, a jewel of a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears rather than miles.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, we faced the perils of subspace turbulence, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the chilling unknown of alien landscapes. Yet,  the view from the observation deck, a panorama of nebulae and swirling galaxies, was a reward beyond any earthly kingdom, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of the unexplored.
