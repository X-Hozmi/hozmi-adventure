
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky.  My quest? To reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravages my village.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Eldoria, of hope and salvation, spur me onward, a lone figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion.  Through the viewport, swirling nebulae paint the void in breathtaking colors, a stark contrast to the sterile, metallic interior.  My mission: to deliver vital genetic samples to the Xylos colony, a world light-years from our own, struggling to survive a devastating blight. The journey is fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate attacks, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the knowledge that my cargo holds the potential to save a civilization fuels my determination, propelling me across the unfathomable distances of space.
