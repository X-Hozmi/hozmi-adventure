The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies in the crowded caravan snaking its way across the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  Each rise over a hill offered a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Starseeker', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted a breathtaking panorama across her viewport, a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of the bridge.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The risks were immense – unpredictable gravitational fields, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to push the boundaries of human knowledge, far outweighed any danger in Eva's unwavering gaze.
