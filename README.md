
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held a chipped map, its faded ink barely hinting at the route to Constantinople, a city shimmering like a mirage in her fevered dreams.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, scorching heat, and the gnawing hunger that clung to her like the dust itself.  But the lure of the legendary silk workshops, the promise of untold riches and a new life, spurred her onward, a tiny speck against the vast, ancient landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The journey was measured not in days but in lightyears, each jump a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Alien encounters, engine malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were just some of the hazards faced in his quest for scientific discovery and untold glory among the stars.
