
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, guided her towards the mythical City of Whispers, a journey fraught with bandit raids, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of the harsh winter looming on the horizon.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory in a land both beautiful and brutal.  Survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking involving unmapped wormholes, hostile alien patrols, and the constant threat of engine failure light-years from any friendly spaceport.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, a constant gamble for survival and discovery.
