
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the treacherous mountain itself.  Survival, let alone success, demanded courage, cunning, and an unwavering will.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic hyperspace jump.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the parasitic Xylosian leviathans tested the limits of both ship and crew.  The vast, unknown expanse of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, but the hope of finding the colonists spurred Eva and her team onward, across the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
