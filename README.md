
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the mud, the biting wind whipping at their cloaks.  Their journey across the Kingdom of Aerilon is fraught with peril; rumors of brigands infest the Blackwood Forest, and the King's levy demands a hefty toll in every village.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – fording icy rivers, negotiating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager rations in squalid inns.  Yet, the quest to retrieve the stolen relic fuels their weary steps, the promise of glory and riches a shimmering beacon in the ever-present gloom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, chart unmapped nebulae and navigate asteroid fields with the precision born of years of training.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast emptiness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the silent hum of the ship's engines a constant companion against the infinite black.  Alien encounters are inevitable, some friendly, others… less so.  The journey promises untold riches, but the cost of failure is far greater than just a failed mission.
