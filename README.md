
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, filled with the harsh beauty of untamed landscapes – towering mountains kissed by snow, sun-baked deserts shimmering with heat haze, and dark forests teeming with unseen dangers.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadows, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope for his sister spurred him on, pushing him deeper into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly across lightyears of space.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking slightly as it navigated asteroid fields and the gravitational pull of distant suns.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced dangers far removed from medieval woes – rogue black holes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vastness of space. Yet, the siren call of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, propelled them forward, just as it had driven countless adventurers before them.
