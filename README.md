
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn map, more a collection of scribbled notes and whispered rumors than precise cartography, is her only guide through bandit-infested passes and treacherous mountain trails. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential encounter—with danger, or perhaps, with unexpected fortune.  The lure of the East, of silks and spices and untold riches, fuels her relentless journey despite the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in the starship *Stardust*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of celestial bodies is child's play compared to the political intrigue and technological hurdles he faces.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, holds infinite possibilities – and equally infinite perils – for those daring enough to explore its mysteries.
