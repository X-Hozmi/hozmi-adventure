
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the ancient map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in her quest;  the true adventure lay in the unwavering hope fueling her journey across the vast, unknown stretches of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world light years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering alien signals were all part of a typical day for Eva.  The vastness of space held wonders beyond imagining, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking unknown, filled with the exhilarating risk and reward that defined life as an intergalactic explorer.
