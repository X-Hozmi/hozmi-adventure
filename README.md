
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the sprawling plains of France in fiery hues.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed purpose, each hardship a testament to his unwavering faith and the intoxicating allure of the unknown that lay ahead.  The rough-hewn map clutched in his hand was his only guide, the whispering wind his only companion on this epic adventure across a continent teeming with both beauty and brutality.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr pirates, Eva relied on her instincts and advanced technology, her journey a thrilling dance between human ingenuity and the unforgiving vastness of space.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each new star system a potential treasure trove of discovery – or a deadly trap.  The galaxy was her playground, a tapestry woven with wonder, danger, and the intoxicating promise of the unimaginable.
