
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, had already claimed one of their number to fever and bandits another.  Days bled into weeks, marked only by the relentless rhythm of their horses' hooves, the creak of their worn saddles, and the ever-present fear of ambush. The vast, unforgiving landscape tested their mettle, yet the whispered legends of Ys, a city of unimaginable wealth and splendor, spurred them onwards, despite the ever-present threat of starvation, disease, and violence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a nebula of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknown. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of explored space, a signal flickering weakly across the vast gulf of the cosmos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate vessels, she relied on the ship's aging technology and her own unwavering courage. The cosmos held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that dwarfed even the harshest medieval landscape, a constant reminder that the pursuit of discovery often comes at a steep price.
