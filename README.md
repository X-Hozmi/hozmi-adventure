
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas in tow, rode hard across the windswept plains of France. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the weather threatened with freezing rain and snow, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at their bellies.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages.  Their adventure was a test of endurance, faith, and the unwavering bond between knight and squire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships was a daily occurrence. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held dangers far beyond any medieval knight could imagine.  But Eva, fueled by the needs of her people and a thirst for exploration, pressed onward, her journey a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of the unknown.
