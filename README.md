
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious seeds of a drought-resistant grain, her only hope of saving her village from starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the dangers that lurked – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving terrain itself.  This perilous journey across the kingdom was a gamble, but one Elara was willing to take for her people.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas painting her ship in ethereal hues.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy, rumored to exist on a remote planet orbiting a dying star.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were everyday occurrences for Eva, but the lure of the crystal, and the potential it held to save her war-torn galaxy, fueled her relentless pursuit across the vast expanse of space.
