
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track wound through a forest thick with ancient oaks, the air alive with the calls of unseen birds and the rustle of unseen things.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for the King's mysterious ailment. Each creak of the saddle, each splash through a stream, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague that stalked the land.  Survival, let alone success, felt like a distant star.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in weeks of hyperspace jumps, was a constant battle against cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels.  But the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding new life and resources, propelled her forward, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted vastness of space.
