
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the creak of leather and the thud of hooves his only companions in the vast, unforgiving landscape. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a powerful ancient magic.  He navigated treacherous mountain passes, dodged bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and bartered for meager provisions in dusty villages, his resolve tested by hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the legends and the tantalizing promise of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the navigation console. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps sent shivers through the vessel, while the ever-present hum of the hyperdrive was a constant reminder of the immense distances and the risks involved.  Alien encounters, unexpected gravitational anomalies, and the constant threat of engine failure were all part of the perilous journey, but the lure of the unknown, and the hope of finding survivors, kept her focused on the stars ahead.
