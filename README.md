
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses' hooves kicking up clouds of ochre.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden amidst shifting sands.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of untold riches and the glory awaiting the first European to reach the mythical oasis spurred them onward, their courage fueled by flickering campfires and tales of ancient wonders.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of deep space were all part of the journey.  Yet, the potential reward – a new beginning for humanity – eclipsed the inherent risks, guiding her through the vast emptiness between worlds.
