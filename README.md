
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Alexandria, a pilgrimage fuelled by whispered legends of ancient wisdom and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested her resolve daily.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a quiet prayer of survival.  The road ahead remained uncertain, a tapestry woven with both fear and exhilarating anticipation.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant, nerve-wracking ballet.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the vast chasm between galaxies.  The journey was lonely, punctuated only by the hum of the ship’s engines and the endless, breathtaking panorama of nebulae and distant suns.  The potential rewards, however, far outweighed the risks, fueling her relentless drive towards the unknown.
