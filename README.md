
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudged through the mud, the chill autumn wind biting at their faces.  Their journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a battle against treacherous terrain, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  They passed through bustling market towns and desolate forests, the tapestry of medieval life unfolding before them – a kaleidoscope of vibrant festivals, hushed monasteries, and the grim realities of war-torn villages.  Their quest for salvation was intertwined with the unpredictable rhythms of the era, a true adventure fraught with peril and promise.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the Andromeda Galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace still held a thrill.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, the ship buffeted by gravitational forces and cosmic anomalies.  Her mission: to establish contact with a newly discovered sentient species. The cosmos was her playground, a boundless expanse teeming with wonders and dangers, an adventure far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval knights.
