
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held her few possessions – a worn map, a chipped flint, and a dwindling supply of hardtack.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness, but the journey was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of the craggy peaks, and the unforgiving terrain threatened to claim her at any moment.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine – a testament to the constant uncertainty of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  The hyperdrive hummed, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, inky blackness outside.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to achieving faster-than-light travel.  Unlike Elara, Eva faced a different kind of peril; the unpredictable nature of spacetime, the threat of pirate raiders in the black market sectors, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown celestial anomalies. Yet, the boundless expanse of the cosmos fueled her spirit, promising a reward far beyond the wildest dreams of any medieval adventurer.
