
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the endless expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, felt a familiar weight on her shoulders.  This journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Papal court, was fraught with peril – bandits, disease, and the unpredictable nature of the land itself threatened her every step.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of distant lands, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast tapestry of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, held its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. But the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories among the stars, fueled her and her crew, their hearts mirroring the boundless expanse of the cosmos above.
