
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the creak of saddle leather a counterpoint to the rhythmic clop of hooves.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden amidst the scorching sands of the Sahara.  He carried with him only a worn map, a dwindling supply of water skins, and the unwavering loyalty of his squire, a boy barely old enough to wield a sword.  Every sunset brought the gnawing fear of ambush, every sunrise the hope of reaching his destination before succumbing to the unforgiving desert.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust painting her viewport in breathtaking hues. Her mission: a multi-galactic trade expedition, charting new routes and seeking rare minerals.  The vastness of space, speckled with unfamiliar stars and the ever-present hum of the hyperdrive, held a different kind of peril—the unpredictable nature of wormholes, the threat of pirate raiders, and the constant gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, spurred her onward across the uncharted expanse.
