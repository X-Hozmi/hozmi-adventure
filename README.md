
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant sheep hangs in the air, a stark contrast to the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored healing shrine nestled in the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains, is fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation test her resolve, but the whispered promise of salvation fuels her onward.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in her desperate quest.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and wormholes, her crew charts unknown nebulae and seeks out lost colonies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, the vast, unknowable expanse of space a breathtaking and terrifying backdrop to their mission.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's trek, Ryla faces the challenges of alien encounters, dwindling resources, and the ever-present threat of catastrophic system failures in her relentless pursuit of discovery across the cosmos.
