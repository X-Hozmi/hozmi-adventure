
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the next hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation have tested her resolve, but the glint of the distant oasis, a shimmering mirage on the horizon, fuels her onward.  Each day brings new challenges, forcing her to rely on her wit and courage to navigate the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel has shrunk the galaxy, yet the journey remains perilous, fraught with the risks of asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  The vast emptiness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, presses in on her as she navigates the intricate hyperspace routes, her gaze fixed on the distant, beckoning light of her destination.
