
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains, her worn leather satchel holding all she possessed.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest – to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother’s plague – was fraught with peril, a constant dance between the treacherous paths and the even more treacherous intentions of men. The promise of salvation spurred her onward, despite the biting wind and the gnawing hunger.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a stark contrast to the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae painted across her viewport.  Her mission: a decades-long expedition to chart unmapped sectors, seeking new habitable worlds for a humanity desperately clinging to survival after a catastrophic solar flare. The cosmic ocean held both wonder and danger, each jump a gamble against unknown anomalies and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  But the potential for discovery, for a new dawn for humanity, made the risk worthwhile.
