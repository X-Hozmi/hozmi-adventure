
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as his small band of mercenaries trudged across the sun-baked plains.  Their destination: the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a legendary oasis said to hold untold riches.  Each creak of saddle leather, each raven's shadow overhead, whispered of both the danger and the intoxicating promise of adventure. Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles facing them on their arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The lure of the unknown, however, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the perils of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  Advanced sensors constantly scanned for gravitational anomalies, while the ship's AI, a sardonic entity named HAL-E, offered dry commentary on the odds of survival. The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on them, a stark contrast to the cozy confines of their spacecraft, yet the allure of discovery, of charting the uncharted, pushed them further into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
