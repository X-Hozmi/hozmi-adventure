
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Breton countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping plague.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill – and the terror – of the unknown, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of illness.  This was adventure, raw and untamed, a gamble with fate itself.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, star-strewn emptiness. This wasn't a quest for a cure, but for a new beginning, a chance to chart the unmapped territories of the galaxy and claim a future for humanity among the stars.  The danger was less bandits and more rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes, but the thrill of discovery remained – a cosmic gamble on an unimaginable scale.
