
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy brown curtain separating him from the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, famine, or worse – the insidious touch of the Black Death itself. The journey was a gamble, a harrowing race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful canvas of celestial wonders, held both promise and peril.  Asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested the crew's mettle as they pushed the boundaries of human exploration, yearning for the discovery of a new home amongst the stars.
