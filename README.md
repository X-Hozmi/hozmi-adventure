The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – towering peaks clawed at the sky, while the valley below teemed with dangers both human and beastly.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's deadly affliction. Each league brought new challenges: brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and exhaustion.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would test the limits of both her ship and her crew.

Yet, the thought of finding the colonists, of bringing them home, fueled her determination, making the unimaginable distances and perilous cosmic obstacles seem like a small price to pay.
