
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the Catalan plains.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, fueled by hope and a fierce determination, kept her pushing forward, a lone figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust*, a sleek vessel cutting through the inky black of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: a daring expedition to the uncharted Kepler-186f system, searching for habitable worlds capable of sustaining humanity's expanding reach.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling cosmic storms, and facing the unknown dangers of alien landscapes was all in a day's work for Nova and her crew.  The boundless expanse of space, while terrifying, held an irresistible allure, promising discovery and the possibility of a new beginning for humankind among the stars.
