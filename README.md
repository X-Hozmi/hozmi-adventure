
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through dense forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in dusty tavern tales, fueled his relentless journey, a quest for both glory and unimaginable riches.  The rough-hewn map, clutched tight in his hand, was his only guide through the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, held dangers far removed from Sir Reginald's medieval concerns – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the unpredictable whims of warp-drive technology.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to plant humanity's flag on new soil, drove her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the cosmic ocean.
