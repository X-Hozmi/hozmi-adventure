
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a glimmer of hope in the face of despair, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-regenerative sample from the Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of rival corporations was child's play compared to the unpredictable Xylos storms that threatened to tear her ship apart.  But the potential to save billions across the Galactic Federation fueled her journey, pushing her and her crew to the very limits of their courage and technological prowess.
