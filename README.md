
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's future, a desperate journey to find her ailing brother a rumored healer in Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the relentless sun beat down, but the hope of healing fueled her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the parched fields, whispered tales of the unknown, a tapestry woven with both peril and the promise of deliverance.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been fraught with unforeseen gravitational distortions, but the promise of a new colony, a fresh start amidst a thriving alien ecosystem, outweighed the risks.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and breathtaking, a journey punctuated by the hum of the engines and the distant whisper of celestial bodies, each a potential obstacle, each a possible new discovery.
