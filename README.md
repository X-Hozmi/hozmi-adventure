
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of ancient secrets hidden within Zerzura's walls, kept her spurred onward through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through a nebula painted in cosmic fire.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Navigating through wormholes, dodging space pirates, and battling the existential dread of infinite space, she and her crew faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Yet, like Elara before her, the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of the known, fueled their daring voyage among the stars.
