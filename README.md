
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Andalusia.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just meager rations; it contains a stolen map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of the ancients.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are but minor inconveniences compared to the thrill of the unknown – the chance to uncover secrets lost to time and claim her place among the legendary explorers.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of a journey well-undertaken.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the cosmic expanse holds its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. Yet, the allure of discovery remains potent, a siren song echoing across the galaxy.  The vastness of space offers infinite possibilities, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the extraordinary, each new planet a tapestry waiting to be unfurled.
