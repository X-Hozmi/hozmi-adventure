
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats and a chipped map, a testament to the months spent traversing treacherous mountain passes and dodging bandits.  The whispered legends of the lost city of Ys spurred her onward, a mythical prize worth risking everything for – a perilous journey fueled by hope and a thirst for the unknown, amidst a world steeped in both beauty and brutality.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a gamble, charting unmapped star systems and navigating asteroid fields that threatened to crush his vessel.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of opening up a universe of possibilities, outweighed the risks a thousand times over.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, offered a different kind of adventure than any medieval wanderer could ever imagine.
