
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, guided his weary horse across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred him onward. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating dense forests, bartering for supplies in dusty villages, and dodging the suspicious eyes of rival knights.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the vastness of space held terrors both known and unknown.  But Elara, hardened by years of exploring the cosmos, pushed the *Stardust* further than any ship had dared to go before.  The promise of discovery, the hope of saving lost souls, fueled her relentless journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
