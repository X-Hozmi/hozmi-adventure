
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a brown tide swallowed by the endless expanse of the French countryside. Their quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and unpredictable, and the whispers of plague haunted every village they passed.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the promise of another day battling the elements and the unknown.  Survival, let alone success, felt like a monumental victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of sublight jumps and calculated warp drives, punctuated by the ever-present hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of comms chatter.  Asteroid fields posed a constant threat, the vast emptiness of space a lonely companion, and the potential for unforeseen anomalies a chilling possibility.  But the promise of new worlds, of untold discoveries and the expansion of humanity, fueled their unwavering determination.
