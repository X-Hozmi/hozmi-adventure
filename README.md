
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Black Forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered of both peril and the thrilling unknown.  Robbers, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this desperate journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver splinter against the inky blackness.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey, measured not in days but in months of hyperspace travel, was fraught with its own dangers.  Nebulae, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested both her skills and the ship's resilience.  But the potential discovery of new life, a new beginning for humanity, fueled her determination to push ever further into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
