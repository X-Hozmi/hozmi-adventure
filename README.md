
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or perhaps worse, the encroaching despair of his desperate journey.  He pressed on, driven by hope and the unwavering belief in the tales of Eldoria's healing powers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's audacious reach.  While lacking the immediate physical threats of Reginald's journey, Eva faced dangers of a different kind:  the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding life beyond Earth, fuelled her unwavering determination.
