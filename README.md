
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, slogs across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen by spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, promising both refuge and untold dangers.  Our destination, the fabled city of Samarkand, feels as distant and mythical as the stars themselves, a beacon guiding us through this perilous, yet exhilarating journey across the known world.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The Althea, a sleek starship, leaps across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a whisper of unimaginable power.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable worlds amidst nebulae painted across the cosmos. Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the potential for discovery – or annihilation – lurking behind every celestial body.  The vastness of space dwarfs even the wildest medieval dreams, but the thirst for the unexplored remains eternally human.
