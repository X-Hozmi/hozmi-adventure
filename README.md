
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s worn boots crunched on the cracked earth of the King’s Road.  Her pack, heavy with meager supplies and a map older than her grandfather, felt like a lead weight on her shoulders.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon’s Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold the cure for her brother's ailment.  Each step was a gamble, fraught with the dangers of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the hope of Eldoria spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Sparks' Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling nebulae and distant suns, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The journey, a gamble with time and distance, held the promise of unimaginable technological advancement, but failure meant oblivion swallowed whole by the cold emptiness of the cosmos.
