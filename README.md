
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of decay from a recently passed caravan.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister, felt less like a grand adventure and more a desperate struggle against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of bandits. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, brought a fresh wave of anxiety, a constant reminder of the perils of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues of gas giants and the distant shimmer of uncharted star systems painted a breathtaking panorama across her viewport. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that dwarfed even the most ambitious medieval expeditions.  But unlike Thomas's simple horse, her vessel battled cosmic radiation, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets, making her galactic voyage a treacherous, high-stakes adventure on a cosmic scale.
