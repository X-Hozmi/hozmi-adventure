
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them on, their determination forged in the crucible of hardship and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and repairing warp drive malfunctions were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, but Eva and her crew pressed forward, driven by a sense of duty and the unwavering belief that somewhere, beyond the endless stars, lay the hope of a lost civilization.
