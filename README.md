
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate moorland, a stark contrast to the bustling taverns and crowded markets left far behind. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling breath of death itself.  The journey was a constant gamble against the elements and the unknown, a brutal test of endurance and will.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship hurtling through the void between galaxies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness surrounding her was both awe-inspiring and terrifying – a whisper of cosmic loneliness punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling of comms.  The perilous journey was fraught with unpredictable nebulae, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the black.  The stakes were high: the survival of her crew and the fate of a potential new home for humanity.
