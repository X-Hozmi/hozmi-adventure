
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the rough terrain tested their mounts and their resilience, and the gnawing hunger was a persistent companion. Yet, with each sunrise revealing breathtaking vistas and each shared hardship forging stronger bonds, their adventure was etched into their souls, a testament to human endurance and the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards. The vast, awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos, however, compensated for the ever-present danger.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the breathtaking unknown, a thrilling gamble for the future of humanity itself.
