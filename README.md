
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold ancient healing knowledge.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the bandits, wild animals, and unpredictable terrain that threatened her journey.  Survival depended on resourcefulness and a deep well of courage, qualities forged in the crucible of a medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, his starship a tiny speck against the backdrop of swirling cosmic dust.  His mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol System and the newly discovered Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, however, held dangers far beyond brigands and wild beasts.  Uncharted asteroid fields, volatile wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested the limits of his ship's technology and his crew's resilience.  The reward, though, was the potential to unlock intergalactic commerce and usher in a new era of planetary unity.
