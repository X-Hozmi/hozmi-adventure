
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and hastily scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the dry brush, was a potential harbinger of danger.  Yet, the whispered rumors of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a beacon in the oppressive darkness of the medieval world.  The adventure was fraught with peril, but the potential reward far outweighed the risks.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational currents and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and teeming with the promise of alien civilizations and uncharted planets. The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.  The rewards – the advancement of human knowledge and the possibility of first contact – fueled their daring expedition.
