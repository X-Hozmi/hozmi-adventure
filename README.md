
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her belly.  Yet, the whispered promise of the holy relics, the thrill of the unknown, spurred her on, each hardship forging a stronger spirit within.  She was a pilgrim, a traveler, a woman defying the expectations of her time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies in search of habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to expand human civilization beyond its dying cradle, fueled her unwavering determination.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a testament to human resilience in the face of the cosmic unknown.
