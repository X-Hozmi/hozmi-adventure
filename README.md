
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose propelled her forward, driven by faith and the unwavering hope of reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets amidst a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders.  The journey, however, was a lonely odyssey through the vast, inky blackness, punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the occasional flash of distant supernovae.  But the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds teeming with untold possibilities, fueled her tireless exploration across the unimaginable distances of space.
