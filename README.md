
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through a dense, primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent a prickle of fear down his spine, for tales of brigands and mythical beasts were as common as the ubiquitous flies.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the legendary Sword of Aethelred, a weapon said to hold the power to vanquish the encroaching plague.  The journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was as much a test of his courage as it was a pilgrimage to salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of a swirling nebula.  Beyond the viewport, galaxies spun in a dizzying ballet of light and color, each a potential destination, each a universe of untold wonders and dangers. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel—a secret that could change the balance of power across the known expanse.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers, Eva faced challenges as daunting as any medieval knight, but hers were waged amongst the stars.
