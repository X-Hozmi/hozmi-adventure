
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside, her worn leather satchel containing all she owned.  Ahead lay the rumored monastery of Saint Gildas, said to hold a sacred relic capable of healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses; bandits were as common a sight as the wildflowers blooming along the road, and the treacherous mountain passes threatened more than just delay.  Survival, not comfort, dictated her every move.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a perilous journey across uncharted sectors rife with cosmic anomalies and pirate fleets.  The hyperdrive hummed a constant, hypnotic thrum, a stark contrast to the breathtaking visuals of celestial wonders unseen by human eyes.  The success of her mission, and the survival of her crew, rested on her navigational skills and the unwavering loyalty of her team.
