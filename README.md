
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, brittle with age, guides her towards the rumored lost city of Ys, a quest whispered in hushed tones amongst the traveling merchants.  Each day brings new challenges – treacherous mountain paths, encounters with suspicious knights, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of legend, fuels her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx strides across the bridge linking the gargantuan Xylos freighter to the shimmering spaceport of Kepler-186f.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of terraforming algae across the Lyra constellation.  Instead of mountains and bandits, he faces the perils of asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  His starship, a sleek vessel of advanced technology, cuts through the inky blackness of space, carrying him towards a new world teeming with possibility and danger in equal measure.  The journey may be faster than Elara's, but the spirit of adventure remains the same.
