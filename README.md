
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the very air seemed to whisper of hardship and uncertainty. Yet, with each sunrise, her spirit burned brighter, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination and the thrill of facing the unknown.  The rough-hewn path was her story, etched in sweat and grit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Warp drives hummed, a symphony of controlled chaos, as she navigated asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational currents.  The vast, breathtaking expanse of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying danger, a cosmic canvas where survival depended on skill, courage, and a dash of blind faith in the stars themselves.
