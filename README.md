
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance.  Her journey across France had been arduous – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the promise of finding her estranged brother, a knight serving the Pope, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another mile conquered, another hardship overcome.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand was her only guide, and the stars her only true companions.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever into position.  The iridescent nebula outside the cockpit of the 'Stardust Drifter' swirled into a kaleidoscope of colours before resolving into the familiar, twin suns of Kepler-16b.  Their mission, to retrieve a vital data crystal from a derelict research station orbiting the gas giant, was far from routine – pirate scavengers were known to patrol these sectors.  The vastness of space held a different kind of peril than the medieval wilderness:  the silence, the crushing isolation, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos. But the allure of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, surpassed any fear.
