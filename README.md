
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the tales of exotic spices and shimmering silks he’d heard whispered in taverns. His quest – to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy – was a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and down sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, a constant test of endurance and wit against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer', its sleek hull a silver needle piercing the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and combating the unpredictable temporal distortions of hyperspace were commonplace hazards.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, the chilling silence of the void, and the exhilarating thrill of discovering new worlds fuelled her insatiable desire to explore the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
