
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes.  Each sunrise revealed a breathtaking panorama – snow-capped peaks piercing a sapphire sky – yet beauty offered little solace against the gnawing hunger and ever-present threat of bandits.  My quest, to reach the fabled city of Samarkand and secure a rare spice for a dying king, drove me onward, pushing aside fear and fatigue with every labored step. The road was long, and fraught with peril, but the promise of reward, both material and spiritual, kept my hope alive.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were my highway.  My ship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaped across the vast expanse between nebulae, the iridescent swirls of gas and dust a breathtaking backdrop to our journey to Xylos.  The thrill of hyperspace travel, the subtle hum of the Alcubierre drive, never dulled, even after years spent charting the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  This time, the danger was not bandits, but rogue asteroid fields and the unpredictable nature of wormholes, each jump a gamble against the cold indifference of the cosmos. Yet, the lure of discovery, of finding new worlds and new life, far surpassed any risk.
