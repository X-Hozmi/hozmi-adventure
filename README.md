His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the brutal elements.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation pushed him across sun-baked plains and through dense, shadow-haunted forests, each landmark a testament to his perilous journey across a land both beautiful and unforgiving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, a sleek starship hurtling through the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope swallowed by the swirling chaos of the Andromeda nebula.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory scavengers that haunted hyperspace were child's play compared to the political intrigue and desperate survival that awaited her on the other side – a journey not only across vast distances, but also through the murky depths of human ambition and the unknown.
