
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his mule westward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise reveals a new tapestry of rolling hills, dense forests teeming with unseen dangers, and the occasional hostile village clinging precariously to a cliffside.  The journey is a constant struggle against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing doubt that whispers Zerzura is nothing more than a fanciful tale.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where derelict alien vessels and unpredictable gravitational anomalies are constant threats.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulas, and the potential for discovery fuel her relentless drive, pushing her ever farther into the uncharted darkness.
