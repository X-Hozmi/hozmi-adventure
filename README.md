
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispers of plague stalked their weary steps.  Each creak of their packhorses, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down their spines.  Yet, the allure of Jerusalem, the promise of redemption and untold riches, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape.  Their adventure was a gamble against the odds, a testament to human endurance and unwavering faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, but the true challenge lay in the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  The vast expanse of the galaxy, a canvas of swirling colours and distant suns, both terrified and exhilarated her.  The quest for survival and the hope of finding humanity's lost brethren propelled her ship forward, into the uncharted depths of the cosmos.
