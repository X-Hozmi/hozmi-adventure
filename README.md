His journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had already taken him across treacherous mountain passes, through sun-baked deserts teeming with bandits, and across rivers swollen with spring rains. Each sunrise brought new challenges – starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of conflict – but the unwavering faith in his heart, and the glimmer of Jerusalem on the horizon, spurred him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, yet the vast, unknowable expanse of space always held a certain thrill, a constant reminder of the fragile nature of life and the boundless wonders – and dangers – of the cosmos.
