The dusty track stretched before him, a ribbon unwinding through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  He carried with him not only a worn map promising untold riches in the East, but also the weight of a king's desperate plea – a desperate need for spices to stave off a deadly plague.

Elara's journey was a race against time, a gamble against the vast, indifferent universe, a quest for knowledge that could change the fate of humankind forever.
