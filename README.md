
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind biting at her face.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life in the distant city of Alexandria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a chance encounter with a traveling merchant, or the discovery of a forgotten shrine hidden amongst the peaks. The journey was perilous, but the promise of a different destiny fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each alien system a potential treasure trove of new discoveries and untold dangers. The cosmos held infinite possibilities, and Ryla, with her courageous crew, was determined to chart them all.
