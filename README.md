
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula stretching before her.  Her worn leather jerkin chafed, a constant reminder of the miles already traversed, each step a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The whispered tales of the fabled city of Samarkand, with its silks and spices, fueled her weary journey, a beacon in the sprawling wilderness.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of adventure, of discovery, kept her pushing onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a delicate dance with gravity wells and unpredictable space currents, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  Unlike the medieval travelers who relied on the sun and stars, Eva navigated using complex astrogation systems, yet the thrill was the same – the intoxicating allure of charting unexplored territories, facing unimaginable challenges, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge across the vast cosmic ocean.
