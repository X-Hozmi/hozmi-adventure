
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the unwavering hope of salvation spurred them forward, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted for the Kepler-186f system.  The vastness of space held a different kind of peril: unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant hum of the ship’s aging engines a constant reminder of the fragility of their mission.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers united by their scientific curiosity and thirst for discovery, navigated the cosmic ocean, each jump to a new star system a leap of faith into the breathtaking, and potentially deadly, mysteries of the galaxy.
