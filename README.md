
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  The midday sun beats down mercilessly, the air thick with the scent of camel dung and sweat.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown –  will we find respite in a friendly village, or face the bandits who stalk the shadows of the ancient ruins?  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for both peril and wonder, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a starship honed to a razor's edge of speed and efficiency, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, searching for habitable planets.  The vast, silent expanse of space is both breathtaking and terrifying.  The hum of the engines is a constant companion, a lullaby against the potential dangers lurking in the void – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, or the unpredictable whims of hyperspace itself.  Each jump to light speed is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.
