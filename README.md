
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the besieged King.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mixture of apprehension and exhilaration.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were all part of the journey, but the urgency of her mission, the weight of her responsibility, kept her spurred onward.  The wind carried the scent of pine and impending storm, mirroring the turbulent adventure unfolding around her.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from the known galaxy.  The ship bucked against the gravitational pull of a rogue asteroid field, a routine but ever-present danger in interstellar travel.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, dwarfed even his seasoned experience, while the unknown dangers lurking on Kepler-186f represented a challenge that promised a thrilling, if potentially fatal, reward.
