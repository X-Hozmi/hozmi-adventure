
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a king's desperate plea: find the lost city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for a devastating plague.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for bandit ambush or the whisper of a forgotten path.  Her journey is a tapestry woven with sun-scorched days, freezing nights, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, fueled only by hope and a fierce determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: retrieve vital data from a long-lost research outpost on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps are risky, navigating asteroid fields treacherous, and the whispers of pirate fleets a constant, chilling reminder of the perils of interstellar travel.  But the potential discovery - a breakthrough in faster-than-light travel – outweighs the danger, pushing Ryla and her crew further into the uncharted expanse, where the wonders and terrors of the cosmos await.
