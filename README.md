
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the relentless sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Each creak of the saddle, each strained breath of her weary mount, marked another mile on her perilous journey from Canterbury to Rome.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Yet, the allure of the Holy City, a beacon of faith and hope, propelled her forward, fueled by a devotion that eclipsed even the gnawing hunger and crippling exhaustion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with a different kind of fear – the chilling vastness of space.  Instead of bandits, she faced the unpredictable whims of cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to deliver a vital cargo of bio-engineered crops across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and risking everything for the survival of a distant colony. The vastness of space offered a different kind of challenge, one measured not in leagues but in light years, a journey as perilous as any medieval pilgrimage, but fuelled by scientific hope rather than religious faith.
