His quest: to recover the stolen relic of St. Aldric from the clutches of the Black Baron, rumored to hold court in a forgotten valley beyond.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous terrain, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests.  But the lure of glory and the promise of restoring his family's honor fueled his weary limbs.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for colonization.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and encounters with unknown alien species kept her crew on high alert.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential to reshape the future of humanity, propelled her and her crew across the light-years, charting a course into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
