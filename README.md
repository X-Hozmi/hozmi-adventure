
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the journey ahead.  Across the vast expanse of the French countryside, rumors of a mythical city whispered on the wind – a city of gold, said to be guarded by dragons and shadowed by ancient magic.  My meager pack held only essentials: a worn map, a rusty sword, and the unwavering hope of fortune and glory,  the chilling damp of the forest and the threat of bandits barely registering against the intoxicating lure of the unknown.


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge as our starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leapt across the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – a legendary secret guarded by the enigmatic Kryll.   The crew, a motley bunch of seasoned explorers and starry-eyed novices,  faced the vastness of space with a mixture of excitement and apprehension, knowing that the treasures of Xylos might come at a steep price, paid in risks far greater than any bandit on a muddy road.
