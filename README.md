
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her journey to the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the creeping plague.  Each rocky pass, each whispering forest, presented a new challenge – bandits, treacherous weather, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown. Yet, the glint of distant peaks fuelled her onward, a beacon in the vastness of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the breathtaking cosmic vistas and the thrill of discovering uncharted territories kept the crew captivated.  The unknown wasn't just a fear; it was a promise – a promise of unimaginable discoveries and a legacy etched among the stars.
