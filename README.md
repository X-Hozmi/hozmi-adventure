
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she navigates the treacherous, uncharted mountains separating the Kingdom of Eldoria from the rumored Sunken City of Ys.  Bandits, starved wolves, and the ever-present threat of falling rock are minor inconveniences compared to the whispers of magical beasts and ancient curses that cling to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resourcefulness, as she pushes further into the unknown, driven by the promise of untold riches and the hope of finding her lost brother.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora that holds the key to curing a galactic plague.  Warp jumps fling her across vast interstellar distances, each a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate attacks.  The thrill of exploration mixes with the weight of responsibility as Eva navigates not only the cosmos but the political intrigue and personal sacrifices inherent in a galaxy on the brink.
