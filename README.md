
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of the unwashed masses huddled in nearby villages. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the precarious hope of survival, his spirit fuelled by the lure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as the stars streaked past, a kaleidoscope of impossible colours.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unpredictable alien flora and the echoes of a forgotten civilization.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien lifeforms were just part of the routine risks, the allure of discovery and the promise of scientific breakthrough outweighing the perils of interstellar travel.
