
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the breath misting before me as I urged my weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be home to outlaws and mythical beasts.  My quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril, but one I had sworn to complete.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, a testament to the unpredictable and unforgiving nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Though the journey spanned light-years, the dangers were different – cosmic storms that could tear the ship apart, uncharted nebulae, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on unsuspecting travelers. Unlike the medieval dangers, this journey across the cosmos was measured in calculations and probabilities, yet felt no less perilous in its own way.
