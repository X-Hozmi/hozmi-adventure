
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke a faint comfort against the gnawing hunger.  Her worn leather satchel held the only map she possessed, its parchment brittle with age, detailing a perilous route through the Whispering Mountains to reach the fabled city of Eldoria. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her quest, but the whispered promise of Eldoria’s legendary healing balm fueled her onward, one aching step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter.'  The jump coordinates pulsed on the console, a vibrant green against the black expanse of space.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare energy source on the newly discovered planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of warp-core failure were just part of the routine.  The galaxy was a vast, unpredictable ocean, but Ryla, seasoned by countless voyages, held firm to her course, driven by the need to secure a future for her people.
