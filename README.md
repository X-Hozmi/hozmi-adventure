
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor gleaming faintly under the overcast sky, urged his weary horse onward.  The quest for the lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy embrace of ancient forests teeming with unseen dangers.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, starvation, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria's fabled riches and the glory awaiting its discoverer spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The journey between galaxies was arduous, a test of both ship and crew.  Warp jumps threatened to tear the vessel apart, while asteroid fields demanded split-second precision.  The reward, however – a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – was worth the risk.  The vast emptiness of space, while beautiful, was also terrifyingly isolating, reminding Eva of the immense responsibility she bore for the fate of her crew and the future of interstellar exploration.
