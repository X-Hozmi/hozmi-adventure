
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his squire struggling to keep pace.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swell unpredictably, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, a new breathtaking vista across the unforgiving but beautiful landscape.  Their adventure isn't just about reaching their destination; it's about the countless stories forged in the crucible of travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate factions, and facing the terrifying unknowns of uncharted space, Eva and her crew push the boundaries of human exploration.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap into the vast unknown, a gamble against the infinite possibilities and perils that lie beyond the reach of humankind.
