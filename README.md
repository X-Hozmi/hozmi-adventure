
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the biting wind.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones – a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a thrilling mixture of fear and anticipation fueling his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape. He wasn't alone;  a ragtag band of companions, each with their own reasons for seeking Eldoria, rode beside him, their shared hope a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant lullaby, a comforting drone against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Eva, however, felt anything but calm.  This wasn't just another survey mission;  Kepler-186f held the key to humanity's survival, a new home amidst the dying embers of their old one.  The weight of that responsibility, the potential dangers lurking beyond the stars – these were the true challenges of her interstellar voyage, far greater than any navigational hazard the ship might encounter.
