
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s band of knights crested the hill, the sun glinting off their battered armor.  Before them stretched the unforgiving expanse of the Whispering Wastes, a legendary desert rumored to hold both unimaginable riches and unspeakable horrors. Their quest, a desperate pilgrimage to a mythical oasis said to hold the cure for a plague sweeping their land, would test their courage, their loyalty, and their very endurance.  Each step was a gamble against thirst, bandit raids, and the ever-present threat of the sandstorms that could bury a man alive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a breathtaking distraction from the perilous journey ahead.  Their mission: to deliver vital resources to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a galaxy far removed from the bustling trade lanes of the Federation.  The threat wasn't just the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the constant risk of pirate attacks, but also the unnerving silence of the vast emptiness between stars, a stark reminder of their isolation and the sheer audacity of their interstellar voyage.
