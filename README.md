
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack mules and weary men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing uncertainty of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, all tempered by the camaraderie of shared hardship and the lure of untold riches and exotic spices whispered in hushed tones around crackling campfires.  The journey is arduous, but the whispered legends of silk roads and ancient wonders fuel our determination.

Centuries later, the sleek starship *Stardust* cuts a silent path through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy. Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faint light of distant quasars, her crew a diverse band united by the insatiable human thirst for exploration.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The challenges are different now – navigating asteroid fields, managing life support systems, and confronting the existential dread of interstellar travel – but the thrill of discovery, the push against the boundaries of the known universe, remains the same primal drive that propelled those medieval caravans across continents.
