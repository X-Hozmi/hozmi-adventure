
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her mule laden with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant rain clung to the air, promising both comfort and the threat of bandits. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or disaster. The unpredictable path ahead was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a clandestine retrieval operation on the ice planet of Nird, a world teeming with valuable resources and guarded by fiercely territorial Kryll.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, yet the vast emptiness of space held a thrilling solitude.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each alien encounter a potential ally or enemy.  The galaxy stretched before her, a limitless canvas of opportunity and danger, promising adventures far beyond the reach of medieval dreams.
