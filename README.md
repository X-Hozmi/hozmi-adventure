
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had already claimed two pack mules and a squire's sanity.  Each sunrise revealed a fresh tapestry of challenges: treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise came the invigorating hope of reaching their destination, a hope fueled by the shared camaraderie of his small band and the unwavering faith in their hearts.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white.  The hyperdrive hummed, a low thrum vibrating through the ship as they jumped across the Orion Arm, leaving behind the swirling nebulae of the Crab Cluster.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold indifference of stars, presented a different sort of danger, but the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, burned just as brightly as the campfire had for Sir Reginald.
