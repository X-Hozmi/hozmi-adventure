
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving steppe.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across scorching deserts, and into skirmishes with bandits and warring tribes.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – starvation, dehydration, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the unwavering hope of salvation propelled him forward.  He travelled with a small band of companions and a map passed through several generations and considered to be a legend in itself.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The journey spanned light-years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and pirate attacks.  Facing the vastness of the cosmos, Elara and her crew battled malfunctioning systems, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, their courage fueled by the hope of establishing a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
