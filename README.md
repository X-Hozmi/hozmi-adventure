
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up clouds of ochre dust. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of the unknown, the promise of glory and discovery, spurred them relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.


Thousands of years later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos system, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with peril – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. Yet, the allure of exploring uncharted galaxies, of discovering new life and civilizations, fueled her tireless pursuit, echoing the adventurous spirit of those medieval knights who sought adventure on Earth.
