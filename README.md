
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Her worn map, a patchwork of sketches and cryptic notes, was her only guide through treacherous landscapes – bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her quest. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace; the real threat came from the unpredictable energy storms that could swallow a ship whole.  Yet, the allure of unexplored galaxies, of discovering new life and uncharted territories, propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the cosmos.
