
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her homespun tunic.  Her quest, to reach the legendary city of Zerzura rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague, had taken her far from the familiar fields of her village. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her faster than the desert sun.  But the unwavering hope for her brother’s recovery fueled her onward, each step a gamble against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust Drifter* pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint shimmer of quasars and the hum of the hyperdrive, her crew charted a course to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic storms raged, threatening to tear their vessel apart, and the vast emptiness pressed in on them, a constant reminder of their perilous journey. Yet, the allure of unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, overshadowed the inherent dangers, driving Ryla and her crew relentlessly forward.
