
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a stark silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promised a hidden monastery beyond these treacherous mountains, a sanctuary rumored to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.  The sting of the wind and the ache in her bones were nothing compared to the thrill of the journey itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking spectacle against the black void.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun, rumoured to possess a source of energy that could rewrite galactic trade.  The journey across the void wasn’t without peril; asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept her crew on high alert. But Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, navigated the dangers with a steely gaze and a heart filled with the same restless curiosity that had driven Elara centuries before.
