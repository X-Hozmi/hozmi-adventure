
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked frame, urged his weary horse onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the only witnesses to his arduous journey.  He carried a sealed missive, a desperate plea from a besieged lord, a message that demanded he traverse treacherous mountain passes, evade marauding bandits, and brave the fetid swamps teeming with fever-carrying insects – all to reach the king before it was too late.  Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his horse, echoed the weight of his responsibility and the uncertain adventure before him.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing crucial systems in the vacuum of space were all in a day's work for Elara and her crew.  The breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, however, constantly reminded them of the immense scale of their adventure and the staggering distance separating them from home.
