
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, each step a prayer against bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The sun beat down on my back as I traversed the unforgiving landscape, my trusty steed, a swaybacked mare named Bess, struggling under the weight of our meager supplies.  Each crumbling castle and distant village held the promise of rest, or perhaps danger, a gamble I took with every sunrise.  The journey to Constantinople felt as vast as the ocean itself, each day a new challenge, each night a testament to my resilience.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we leaped between galaxies.  The star-strewn canvas of the cosmos, a breathtaking spectacle from the observation deck, was a stark contrast to the Earth I’d left behind.  My mission: to survey the newly discovered Kepler-186f.  The thrill of exploration, however, was tempered by the ever-present risk of warp storms and the unknown dangers lurking on alien worlds.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held a different kind of peril than any bandit or famine I could have imagined.
