
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, urged his mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Aquitaine, the sun beating down mercilessly.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre from the clutches of a renegade knight rumored to be holed up in the desolate mountains beyond.  Each day brought new perils – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the lure of adventure and the promise of glory pushed him ever closer to his goal.  The road was long and unforgiving, a tapestry woven with hardship and the thrilling uncertainty of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were just part of the routine.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held the promise of new worlds and unimaginable discoveries, driving Eva and her crew across the cosmic sea in pursuit of a future yet unwritten.
