
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles compared to the allure of immortality.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a weary rest under a canvas sky, yet the hope of Zerzura burned brighter than any hearth fire.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems mid-jump were all in a day's work.  The vast, inky blackness held both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of the fragile nature of life amongst the stars, and the immense courage required to traverse the galactic expanse.
