
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and a chipped waterskin; it held the hope of a new life in the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential encounter – a bandit's ambush, a kindly farmer's offering, or perhaps even a glimpse of the mythical Griffin said to haunt these desolate lands.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of a different future spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The crew faced the daunting task of navigating treacherous asteroid fields, avoiding hostile alien patrols, and repairing critical systems with dwindling resources.  Though vastly different from Elara's journey, Rexa faced a similar test of endurance and resilience, driven by the allure of discovery and the hope of charting a course into the unknown.
