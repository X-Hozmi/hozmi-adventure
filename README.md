
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving lands, yet the unwavering hope of finding Zerzura spurred her onwards.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space remained terrifyingly immense.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters filled their days with a unique brand of adventure.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime, but the lure of discovery far outweighed the inherent risks.
