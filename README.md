Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  He carried with him a tattered map, promises of untold riches, and the gnawing fear of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving desert itself.

The journey itself was a gamble, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unknown spatial anomalies, but the potential rewards—a cure for a devastating galactic plague—outweighed the risks.
