
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland.  Her worn leather satchel, containing a cryptic map and a dwindling supply of dried meat, was her only companion on this perilous journey to the rumored hidden monastery of St. Jude.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in a knight's tale, testing her resilience and spirit with every creak of her saddle.  This was not a quest for glory, but for survival and the desperate hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for intergalactic travel.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna and guarded by an unpredictable alien species.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present danger of pirate raids made this journey far more than a simple cargo run; it was a gamble with the fate of billions hanging in the balance.
