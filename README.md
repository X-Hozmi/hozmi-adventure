
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a whisper of gold and forgotten magic that fuelled his desperate quest.  Each day brought new perils: brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  But the lure of Eldoria, of uncovering a forgotten past, pushed him relentlessly towards the unknown. The journey was brutal, but the promise of adventure, of discovery, burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, *The Icarus*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The crimson dust of a dying star painted the viewport in hues of blood orange as they navigated the treacherous asteroid field.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble in the face of dwindling resources.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle, but even that couldn't eliminate the inherent risks of interstellar exploration. Every jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable vastness of the cosmos.
