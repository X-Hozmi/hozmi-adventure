
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in spices, a reward for braving bandit-infested passes and the unforgiving heat.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the next rise, a constant companion on her arduous journey to the bustling port of Barcelona.  Ahead lay the promise of wealth, but the path was fraught with peril, every mile a testament to her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  His destination: the Kepler-186f system, a rumored haven for rare xeno-minerals.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the watchful gaze of the Kryll pirates was all in a day's work. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the greatest medieval journeys, yet the thrill of discovery, the promise of untold riches, and the camaraderie among his crew fueled his every warp jump across the galaxy.
