
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy lanes of York, a cart laden with meager supplies our only companion against the unpredictable wilds of medieval England.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clings to our clothes as we navigate rutted tracks, dodging bandits and braving the unforgiving elements. Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – treacherous bogs, hostile lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Our destination, the fabled city of Constantinople, lies far across the continent, a distant gleam of hope against the harsh reality of the road.

Alternatively, imagine hurtling across the inky blackness of space in 2742.  Our vessel, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a sleek starship capable of faster-than-light travel, cuts a swathe through nebulae of impossible colours.  We're bound for Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The thrill of discovery fuels our journey, but so does the ever-present danger of asteroid fields, rogue gravitational forces, and the unknown alien landscapes that await.  The vast expanse of the cosmos is both our playground and our greatest challenge.
