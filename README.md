
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her destrier across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty; bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of war echo on the wind.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, demands unwavering courage and resilience.  She trades stories and bread with weary travelers, bargains with shrewd merchants, and navigates treacherous mountain passes, fueled by a belief in the healing power rumored to reside within those hallowed halls.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' commands the starship *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive humming a song of distant nebulae.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien civilizations both benevolent and hostile, Ryla relies on her crew's diverse skills and unwavering loyalty.  The vast expanse of space holds both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, but the promise of finding Xylos, and perhaps even discovering new worlds, propels her forward into the uncharted darkness.
