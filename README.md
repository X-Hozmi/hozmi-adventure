
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, a worn map clutched in her frostbitten hand.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking step was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her.  The sun beat down relentlessly, but the allure of Ys, a shimmering beacon of hope in the vast, uncertain wilderness, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a signal the only clue to their fate.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravity wells of uncharted systems was a daily dance with death.  Yet, the thought of finding survivors, of reuniting a lost civilization, fueled his courage in the cold, vast emptiness of space.  The galaxy held its breath, waiting to see if Comet could find his way home.
