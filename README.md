
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel bumping against her thigh.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death were less daunting than the thrill of her journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a quest for spiritual solace and escape from a life stifled by arranged marriage. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of discovery, the unpredictable beauty and danger of the medieval road stretching endlessly before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Kerrigan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The cosmos unfolded before her, a tapestry of vibrant colours and unimaginable celestial bodies. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to a newly-discovered habitable planet light-years from Earth. The risks were immense – hostile alien encounters, navigation through treacherous asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of system failure. But the vast expanse of space, teeming with untold wonders and mysteries, fuelled her insatiable thirst for exploration, mirroring the spirit of those medieval adventurers who dared to journey across a world far smaller than her own.
