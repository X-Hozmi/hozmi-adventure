
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows that dance with the fear in his heart.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Every mile is a battle against treacherous terrain, thieving bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of his success.  He pushes onward, driven by a desperate hope that flickers like a candle in the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: a perilous journey across the Andromeda Galaxy to locate a lost colony, a whisper of humanity clinging to survival on the far side of the cosmic ocean.  Warp drives hum, navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the predatory gaze of unknown spacefaring creatures.  The vastness of space amplifies the loneliness of the journey, but the possibility of reuniting with a lost piece of humanity fuels her relentless pursuit across the unimaginable distances.
