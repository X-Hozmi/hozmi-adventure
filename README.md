
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the relentless sun beating down on their journey across the unforgiving plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the distance, spurred him onward, a beacon of hope in a world teetering on the brink.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate raids were merely commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of peril—the crushing loneliness of isolation and the gnawing fear of the unknown, lurking in the inky blackness between stars. Yet, the thought of her fellow colonists spurred her on, a flickering flame against the cold expanse of the cosmos.
