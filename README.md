Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the relentless sun, and the gnawing uncertainty of the journey. Yet, with every landmark passed – a crumbling ruin, a whispering oasis, a distant mountain range – her resolve hardened, fueled by the hope of finding salvation at journey's end.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and enduring the crushing loneliness of space were all part of the challenge.  But the vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos, and the promise of a new beginning for humanity, spurred her onward across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
