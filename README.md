
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a fragile scroll containing a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements.  Survival meant relying on her wits, her trusty blade, and the kindness of strangers encountered along the perilous journey eastward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate scavengers demanded precision and courage.  Unlike Elara's journey, Eva faced the vast, unknowable expanse of space, relying on advanced technology and a crew bound by shared risks and the promise of a potentially life-altering discovery.
