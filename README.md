
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and courage, a chance to push ever closer to the shimmering mirage of his destiny. The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the medieval adventurer.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling unpredictable warp storms were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense distances separating humanity's scattered outposts.  Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of discovery, but also the risk of unforeseen dangers in the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
