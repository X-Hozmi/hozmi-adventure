
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Provençal countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a brittle scroll detailing the rumored location of a lost monastery, said to house ancient wisdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked in the shadows.  The journey was fraught with peril, a tapestry woven with the threads of scorching sun, icy nights, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent crystal from the planet Xylos IV, a world teeming with hostile sentient flora.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the intricate political maneuvering required to secure the crystal and escape the clutches of the intergalactic Xylos Syndicate. The vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly empty, held a different kind of danger – the insidious loneliness of the cosmos.
