
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by ancient maps and whispered legends, spurred them relentlessly forward, the vast, unknown landscape both a danger and a promise.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant cosmic canvas teeming with untold wonders and unimaginable perils.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble to secure vital resources for a dwindling Earth.  Warp jumps brought them face to face with celestial anomalies, alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of space.  The vastness of the cosmos presented endless opportunities for discovery, yet each jump carried a risk, a testament to the intrepid spirit that drove humanity to explore the furthest reaches of the universe.
