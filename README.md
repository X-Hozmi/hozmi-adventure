
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent winding through the sun-baked Provençal countryside, creaks towards the distant Pyrenees.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the whispered legends of mythical beasts in the mountains, and the tantalizing promise of distant lands beyond the border.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every call of the hawk circling overhead, is a note in the symphony of our perilous journey, a testament to the courage and resilience required to navigate the unpredictable tapestry of medieval travel.

Conversely, in the 27th century, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is the constant companion to our galactic odyssey.  We traverse the inky blackness between swirling nebulae and distant, uncharted star systems, each jump a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.  Instead of bandits, we face the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  The thrill comes not from the threat of immediate danger, but from the breathtaking scale of the cosmos and the promise of discovering new life forms and lost civilizations scattered across the sprawling galaxy.
