
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, ravenous wolves howling from the peaks, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Sunstone, whispered to reside in the monastery beyond the pass, fueled my weary limbs. The journey was brutal, a test of endurance and will, but the reward – the potential to rewrite history – made it worthwhile.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting lullaby against the vast, inky blackness of space.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  The journey, a mere blink compared to medieval treks, still held its own peril.  Asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction were constant anxieties.  Yet, unlike the medieval traveler, I had the collective knowledge of humanity, the advanced technology of the Althea, and the hope of a new beginning to propel me across the gulf between stars.
