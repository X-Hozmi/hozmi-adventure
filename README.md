
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the unforgiving plains of Francia was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient oaks, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion. Yet, the whispered tales of the fabled city of Ys, a place of untold riches and magic, spurred her on, each hardship a test of her resolve, each mile a step closer to the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, his knuckles white against the worn metal.  Navigation through the Xylos Nebula was treacherous, the chaotic gravitational currents a constant threat to their fragile vessel. The mission to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution, demanded unwavering focus and courage.  The vast, inky expanse of space was both beautiful and terrifying, a testament to the boundless mysteries and infinite dangers that lay beyond humanity's reach.
