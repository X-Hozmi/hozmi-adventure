
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance in the distance, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the promise of bandits, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of untold riches and exotic spices, keeps us moving westward, our weary horses driven by a potent mix of greed and desperation. We are pilgrims on a journey of both trade and self-discovery, facing hardship and wonder in equal measure.

A thousand years hence, the Althea, our generation starship, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby, a background to the breathtaking views of nebulae swirling like cosmic paint strokes.  We are explorers, charting unmapped territories among stars uncountable, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  Our mission: to find a habitable planet, a new Eden for humanity.  The vastness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, our tiny ship a testament to the boundless curiosity and resilience of humankind.
