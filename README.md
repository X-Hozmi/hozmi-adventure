
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she spurred her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of the encroaching storm.  Her journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest, a pilgrimage to seek a rumored healing spring for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows, the path was treacherous and often lost, and the ever-present threat of illness hung heavy in the air.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of fear and anticipation through her.  This was a journey of faith, and survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its sensors humming with the energy of a thousand distant suns. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage across lightyears rather than leagues.  The risks were different – the unpredictable gravitational pulls of black holes, the silent threat of radiation storms, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and expanding the reach of her people, fueled her spirit, a modern-day echo of Elara’s medieval quest.
