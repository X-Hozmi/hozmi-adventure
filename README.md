
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His journey to the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and magic, had already tested his resilience.  Bandit encounters, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger were but small parts of the adventure.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unfamiliar forests, bartering with wary villagers, and constantly watching the horizon for signs of danger.  The allure of Ys, however, fueled his weary steps, promising glory and fortune beyond his wildest dreams.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with peril.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, encounters with unknown alien species, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were commonplace.  The vast distances, the loneliness of deep space, and the constant hum of the ship's engines were a stark contrast to the medieval adventurer's struggles, but the thrill of discovery, the push to uncover the universe's secrets, burned just as brightly in Eva's heart as the desire for Ys burned in Thomas'.
