
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager belongings and a map, its creases a testament to countless miles already traversed.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by both brigands and mythical creatures.  But Elara sought not gold nor glory, but a rumored cure for her ailing brother, a desperate journey fueled by sibling love and unwavering hope. The journey was fraught with peril; every rustling bush, every shadow cast by the encroaching night, held the potential for disaster.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula known as the Serpent's Maw, Ryla expertly dodged rogue asteroids and navigated treacherous gravitational currents. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a signal faintly received across the light-years.  Though the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, void storms, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities –  the unwavering courage and fierce determination driving her were the same as those of Elara centuries before.
