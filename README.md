
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her grandmother's prophecies and a meager supply of dried figs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death still haunted the land. Yet, spurred by a desperate hope to find the mythical Sunstone, Elara pressed onward, the endless horizon her only guide, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and fading gold.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla 'Starfall' Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Faster-than-light drives hummed a hypnotic tune as they jumped between galaxies, the cosmos a breathtaking spectacle of nebulas, dying stars, and newly formed planets.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, whispered to have discovered a source of limitless energy.   The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of warp storms – but the lure of discovery, and the hope of finding a lost people, fueled her journey across the immeasurable gulf between worlds.
