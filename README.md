
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley collection of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the dusty plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Each creak of our overloaded wagon, each snort of our tired horses, marked another mile closer to the fabled city of Alexandria, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Whispers of mythical creatures and ancient ruins spurred us on, a tantalizing mix of danger and discovery.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive resonated through Captain Eva Rostova's bones as she navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat that promised untold riches and knowledge, but also the ever-present risk of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations, or worse, the uncharted anomalies that lurked between the stars. The cosmos held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, a challenge worthy of the boldest explorers.
