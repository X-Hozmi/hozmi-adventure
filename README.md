The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped lands, and the promise of glory that beckoned him towards the horizon.  Each creak of his saddle, each labored breath of his horse, fueled his relentless pursuit of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and wrestling with malfunctioning hyperdrives were all part of a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer. The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the endless possibility of discovery made the risks worthwhile. The universe was her playground, and every jump to hyperspace a leap into the exhilarating unknown.
