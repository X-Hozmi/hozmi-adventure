
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth thick in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge: navigating treacherous mountain passes,  dodging highwaymen lurking in shadowed forests, and bartering for meager sustenance in dust-choked villages. My quest, to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, felt both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant dance between survival and the allure of the unknown. Every sunset painted the sky with hues of hope and uncertainty, mirroring the unpredictable nature of my journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the silence of interstellar space.  The swirling nebula outside my viewport was a breathtaking, terrifying spectacle, a canvas of cosmic dust and dying stars. My mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light years.  While the dangers were less tangible than bandits and starvation, the vastness of space and the potential for unknown anomalies presented a different, equally profound challenge.  The unknown whispered from the void, a constant companion on my solitary voyage among the stars.
