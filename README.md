
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense, foreboding forest.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, heightening the thrill of the unknown.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was perilous, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the constant threat of starvation, but the promise of salvation fueled his relentless advance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyages. The vast, star-dusted canvas of space offered breathtaking beauty, but the loneliness of the cosmos was a constant companion.  The potential discovery of new life, however, and the unraveling of galactic mysteries, made the incredible risks worthwhile.
