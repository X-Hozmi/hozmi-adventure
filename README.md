
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, rumored to swallow men and beasts whole.  Her quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Oakhaven, a journey fraught with peril – not just from the swamp's treacherous bogs and lurking bandits, but from the shadow of the approaching war.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the reeds, held the potential for adventure, for life or death.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to the galaxy-spanning journey. Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space – asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of the cosmos held endless possibilities, yet each jump through hyperspace carried the weight of unknown challenges and the thrill of untold discoveries.
