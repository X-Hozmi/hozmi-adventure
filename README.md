
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried with him a chipped map, a worn prayer book, and a desperate hope.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering belief in his sister's survival fuelled his journey, pushing him across the rugged landscape, a lone figure against the vast and unforgiving medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Warp drives hummed, charting a course through unmapped galaxies, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational pulls.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Eva and her crew faced not only the physical challenges of interstellar travel but the psychological strain of isolation and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life.  The success of their mission rested on their courage, their skill, and their unwavering determination to return home.
