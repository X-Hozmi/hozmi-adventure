
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of reuniting with her estranged brother, a whispered rumor of his whereabouts guiding her across treacherous mountain passes and through lawless forests.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter, but the unwavering fire of familial love spurred her onward, a tiny flame against the backdrop of a medieval world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been risky, pushing the ship's ancient hyperdrive to its limits.  Ahead lay the promise of a new colony, a chance to escape the suffocating politics of Earth, but the vast unknown of interstellar space held its own perils: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The journey tested her courage and skill, but the vast tapestry of stars, each a potential new world, fuelled her relentless pursuit of a better future among the cosmos.
