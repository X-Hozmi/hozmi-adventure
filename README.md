
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the hope of healing fueled his relentless journey across the rugged landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to press on, his fate intertwined with the unpredictable whims of the road.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a perilous expedition to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing vital systems under the strain of warp-drive travel was all in a day's work. The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both incredible beauty and unimaginable danger, yet Eva, driven by humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery, pressed on, her journey a testament to human courage in the face of the ultimate frontier.
