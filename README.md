
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed a mule and several near-frostbite incidents.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, kept their weary spirits alight, driving them across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was fraught with peril – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the promise of sustenance for a new world, a world struggling to take root amongst the stars, fuelled her determination and kept her laser-focused on the distant, emerald glow of their destination.
