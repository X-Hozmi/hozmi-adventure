
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the last seed of a rare healing herb, vital to her ailing village. Bandits, treacherous passes, and gnawing hunger were constant companions on her perilous journey eastward, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the avarice of man.  The whispered legends of the fabled valley beyond fuelled her resolve, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and lethal alien predators.  Warp drives hummed, the stars a breathtaking tapestry beyond the viewport, as Rexx navigated asteroid fields and navigated the treacherous political landscape of the Galactic Federation.  The stakes were high; failure meant not just the death of his crew, but the potential collapse of an entire solar system.
