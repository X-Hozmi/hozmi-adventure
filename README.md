
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, pressed onward across the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of our heavily laden wagons, each labored breath of our mounts, marked another step away from the familiar comfort of our village and deeper into the untamed wilderness.  Rumours of a lost city, glittering with gold and ancient magic, spurred us on, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, wild animals, and the treacherous, unpredictable paths that snaked through dense forests and across raging rivers.  Survival itself was an adventure, a constant test of our strength, courage, and camaraderie.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a swathe through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its powerful engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with perils, from asteroid fields and rogue gravitational wells to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on unsuspecting explorers. Yet, the allure of discovering new life, new worlds, far outweighs the risk.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap into the unknown, a thrilling plunge into the vast, awe-inspiring canvas of the cosmos.
