
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged along the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Her journey across the breadth of France, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romantic tales told in taverns.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with every sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the whispered prayers of fellow travelers a comforting chorus against the vastness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Vex navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes kept her crew on edge.  Each jump between galaxies was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown; a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration, even amongst the infinite void.
