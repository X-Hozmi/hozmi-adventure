
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept moors.  Their destination: the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the churning waves.  Each day brought fresh perils – treacherous bogs, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing hunger that stalked them like a shadow.  But the lure of the lost city, and the whispered promise of unimaginable riches, spurred them onward, their resolve hardened by hardship and fueled by a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than any hearth fire.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, yet the vast, unknowable cosmos held its own brand of danger – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from any known civilization.  But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds, outweighed the risks, propelling her forward into the infinite darkness.
