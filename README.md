
The year is 1348.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging her village – was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a renewed determination to persevere.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Empire was a daily test of skill and nerve.  The vast, inky expanse of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragile nature of life and the immense distances that separated humanity's scattered outposts amongst the stars.
