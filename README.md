
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the endless wars ravaging the land.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless journey through treacherous forests, across raging rivers, and over towering mountain passes. Bandits lurked in the shadows, starvation gnawed at their bellies, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the allure of Ys, and the promise of peace it held, fueled their desperate push towards the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets tested her skill and the ship's resilience.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – silent malfunctions, the ever-present threat of pirates, and the unsettling loneliness of interstellar travel. But the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the mystery of Kepler-186f’s disappearance, propelled her onward across the galactic expanse.
