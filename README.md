
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – precious varieties meant to revitalize the drought-stricken lands of her village.  Bandits, the relentless sun, and the ever-present threat of disease are her constant companions on this perilous journey across the Iberian Peninsula, a quest that demands both courage and resilience.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory, forging her into a woman as tough as the unforgiving land itself.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to deliver vital nanite repair kits to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps through uncharted space, asteroid fields that threaten to tear her ship apart, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life forms are the realities of her galactic voyage.  The vast distances between stars are insignificant compared to the weight of responsibility she carries for the survival of a whole planet.
