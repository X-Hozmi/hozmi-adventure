
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air hangs heavy with the scent of dust and sweat, punctuated by the sharp tang of woodsmoke from our nightly campfires.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, the promise of bustling trade cities, and the ever-present fear of disease and starvation.  Yet, the allure of the Silk Road, of reaching the distant markets of Cathay, fuels our relentless journey, a tapestry woven with danger and hope.

Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  The Althea, a starship boasting sleek, obsidian lines, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies.  My mission: to chart unexplored nebulae, searching for habitable worlds amidst swirling cosmic dust and the ethereal glow of distant quasars.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – the same adventurous spirit propels me forward.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, beckons me onward.
