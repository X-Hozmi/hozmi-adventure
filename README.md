
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the endless expanse of desert.  Each day brings peril – bandits lurking in canyons, scorching sun, dwindling water skins.  But the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic fuel her onward, a stubborn ember against the vast, indifferent landscape.  This journey, though fraught with danger, is a pilgrimage to a destiny she senses, calling her across the harsh terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the crimson nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic storms rage, alien life forms lurk in the shadows of uncharted worlds, and the fuel reserves dwindle with each passing day. Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking galactic secrets, compels Ryla to push onward, her heart a compass guiding her through the infinite darkness.
