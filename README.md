
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the unknown dangers that lurked around every bend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were all in a day's work.  The rewards – the potential discovery of new life, resources, and technologies – made the risks worthwhile, a different kind of adventure under a different kind of sun.
