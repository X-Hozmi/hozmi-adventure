
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His journey across the treacherous Black Mire, a journey undertaken to reach the legendary city of Eldoria and retrieve a stolen relic, had tested his strength, his courage, and his very sanity.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, each day a struggle for survival against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits.  Navigating the asteroid fields and dodging the rogue gravitational pulls of unseen celestial bodies was a constant battle against the vastness and unpredictability of space.  The reward, however, was the potential discovery of a new, habitable planet, a prize worth risking everything to obtain.
