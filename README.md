
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her grizzled companion, Silas, navigated the rutted track through the Ardennes Forest.  Their destination: Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones in their village – a promised land of silks and spices.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  But the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the distant horizon, fueled their weary steps, a potent elixir against the hardships of their arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a breathtaking, terrifying panorama of celestial wonders and potential dangers.  Warp jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the loneliness of deep space gnawed at the crew's resolve. Yet, the lure of discovery, the possibility of rewriting history, outweighed every fear.
