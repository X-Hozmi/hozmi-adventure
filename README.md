
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun a merciless eye in the cloudless sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of starvation in this desolate, sun-baked realm.  Her journey was a testament to human resilience, a gamble on hope itself, spurred by whispers of ancient wonders and a burning thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation console.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The risks were astronomical – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, the ever-present threat of solar flares – but the promise of discovery fueled her crew's unwavering dedication.  Their journey was not just a voyage through space, but a testament to human ambition, a relentless push against the boundaries of the known universe.
