
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving desert tests her endurance daily.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – navigating treacherous sandstorms, finding scarce water, and bartering with suspicious nomads.  Yet, the whisper of ancient wonders and the burning ambition to discover Zerzura's secrets fuels her onward, her heart a compass pointing towards the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The swirling colours of gas giants and the ethereal glow of distant galaxies fill her viewport, a breathtaking spectacle contrasting with the hum of the hyperdrive. Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  The journey isn't without its dangers; asteroid fields threaten to obliterate her ship, and unpredictable spatial anomalies test the limits of her navigation skills.  But the knowledge that her cargo might save a dying colony keeps Ryla focused, her gaze fixed on the distant, hopeful starlight.
