
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather jerkin heavy with the weight of her meager possessions.  The whispers of the Black Death trail behind her, a grim specter driving her westward toward the rumored haven of  Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the thrill of discovery mixed with the constant threat of bandits, starvation, and disease.  The journey is perilous, but the promise of sanctuary, of a new life, fuels her weary legs.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Through wormholes and past treacherous asteroid fields, Jax steers her crew towards the unknown, facing the dangers of alien lifeforms and the ever-present threat of system failures.  The vastness of space is terrifying, yet equally exhilarating; the journey a testament to human ingenuity and the unyielding pursuit of a new dawn.
