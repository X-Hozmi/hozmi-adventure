
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of London, the salty tang of the Thames still clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way across the dusty plains and through dense forests, the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves our constant companion.  Each sunrise brought new challenges:  fording raging rivers, negotiating with suspicious lords, and evading bands of highwaymen.  The whispered tales of mythical beasts and forgotten cities fueled our relentless westward push, a thirst for the unknown driving us ever onward.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  The sleek, obsidian hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' hummed beneath my feet as we jumped to hyperspace, the familiar constellations dissolving into a swirling nebula of vibrant colours.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets and new forms of energy.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional glimpse of a distant, alien world, instilled a humbling awe, a constant reminder of humanity's tiny place amidst the cosmic grandeur.  Each jump was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the unforgiving emptiness of the void.
