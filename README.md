
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the scorching desert promised dehydration and death. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily occurrence.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own brand of peril. But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fragmented people, fueled her unwavering determination to reach the far edge of the known universe.
