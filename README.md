
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Brigid, led her through dense forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes where eagles circled overhead, and into sun-baked valleys where the whispers of ancient ruins promised both wonder and peril.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous river crossings to bartering with suspicious villagers for meagre supplies, but the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet nestled deep within the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable space currents, and the threat of pirate raids loomed large.  But the lure of untold riches, and the whispered legends of the K'tharr's advanced technology, propelled him across the vast expanse of space, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving darkness between stars.
