
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and thyme a poor substitute for the fear gnawing at her stomach.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, disease, or the brutal realities of a world unforgiving to the lone traveler.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, fleeting kindnesses from strangers, and the unwavering hope that fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane connecting the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a feat fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while unknown celestial anomalies lurked in the void, testing the limits of her vessel and her crew's courage.  The vast expanse of space, a beautiful and terrifying canvas of cosmic wonders, presented challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, but the spirit of adventure, the unwavering human thirst to explore the unknown, remained the same.
