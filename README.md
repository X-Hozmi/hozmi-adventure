
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to escape the encroaching plague and find rumored fertile lands in the east.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and promise. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous pilgrimage.  Yet, the fierce determination in her eyes burned brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light years from Earth.  The journey was measured in years, not days, the vastness of space a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the sheer audacity of humanity's reach.  Every jump through hyperspace, every course correction, was a gamble, a dance with the unknown that demanded unwavering skill and courage.  The future, like the galaxy itself, was boundless, fraught with both wonder and unimaginable dangers.
