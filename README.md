
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth spurred his destrier onward, the creak of leather and the rhythmic thud of hooves his only companions.  His quest: to find the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a devastating plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  But the lure of legend and the hope of salvation pushed him ever closer to his unknown destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, HALIX, a calm voice in the deafening silence of space.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet within the Andromeda galaxy, a desperate search for a new home for humanity after Earth's catastrophic collapse.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and battling the crippling loneliness of interstellar travel were all in a day's work. Yet, the boundless expanse of the cosmos held a thrilling promise – the chance to forge a new beginning amongst the stars.
