
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on his chainmail. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura's healing waters fueled his determination, pushing him ever onward despite the hardships of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and swirling star clusters. Her mission, far more ambitious than Sir Reginald's, was to locate a habitable planet for humanity's burgeoning population.  The vast distances were daunting, the unknown dangers cosmic, but the possibility of a new dawn for mankind spurred Eva and her crew across the unimaginable gulf of interstellar space.
