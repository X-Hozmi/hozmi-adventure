
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode through the unforgiving French countryside, his squire struggling to keep pace.  Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Calais, a perilous journey fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating dense forests, fording raging rivers, and bartering for meager sustenance in suspicious villages. The weight of responsibility, and the miles ahead, pressed heavily upon his weary shoulders.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and enduring the crushing loneliness of deep space, Eva relied on her wits, her crew's unwavering loyalty, and the cutting-edge technology of their ship. The vastness of space, though beautiful, held dangers as unpredictable and terrifying as any medieval landscape.
