
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation pushed him across the unforgiving terrain, a testament to the indomitable spirit of medieval adventurers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling cosmic pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps. The vastness of the cosmos offered breathtaking vistas, but every star held the promise of danger – radiation storms, uncharted wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities.  The frontier called, and Eva, like countless explorers before her, answered its siren song.
