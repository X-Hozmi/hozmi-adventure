
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, press onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Eadric, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – a ford to cross, a village to barter with, a rumor of a quicker, yet more dangerous, route to navigate. Their adventure isn't just about reaching their destination, it's about surviving the relentless hardships of the medieval world and forging a bond amidst adversity.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its hull gleaming under the crimson glow of a binary sunset in the Kepler-186f system.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, encountering strange and potentially hostile alien civilizations, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of deep space travel are all part of the routine. Yet, for Eva, this is not just a scientific expedition; it's a quest for the unknown, a chance to push the boundaries of human exploration and discover what secrets the vast universe holds.
