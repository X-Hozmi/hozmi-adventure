
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, fuels a potent mix of fear and exhilaration.  Bandits, starvation, and the sheer brutality of nature are ever-present threats, but the allure of the unknown, the promise of a better future, drives her onward.  The journey is as much a test of her spirit as it is of her physical endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space is both breathtaking and terrifying.  The hum of the ship's engines is a constant companion, a counterpoint to the silence of the cosmos.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp core malfunctions are all part of the routine.  Yet, the drive to explore, to expand humanity's reach among the stars, burns bright within him, eclipsing even the dangers of the interstellar void.
