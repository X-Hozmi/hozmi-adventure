
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked plains of Anatolia stretching before them. Their journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fuelled by both faith and the promise of untold riches, had been arduous.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the relentless sun beat down, testing the limits of their endurance. Each day brought new perils, but also the thrill of the unknown, the seductive whisper of adventure that pushed them onward, despite the ever-present threat of starvation and death.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The treasures sought weren't gold or jewels, but rare alien artifacts and the knowledge contained within ancient, forgotten civilizations scattered across the galaxy.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, held the promise of unimaginable discoveries, making the risks inherent in interstellar travel a price willingly paid.
