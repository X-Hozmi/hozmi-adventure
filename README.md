
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before them.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Compostela, had already claimed a mule and several men to fever and banditry.  Each sunrise brought the chilling uncertainty of what lay ahead – treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests teeming with brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering gleam of faith in their eyes, and the camaraderie forged in hardship, fueled their weary steps towards the distant shrine.


Thousands of years later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere orbiting a distant, uncharted sun.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with peril – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  But Elara, seasoned by countless interstellar voyages, felt a thrill only space could provide – the exhilaration of the unknown, the limitless possibilities of the cosmos stretching before her.
