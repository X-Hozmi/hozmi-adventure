
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the rough-spun wool of her cloak offering little respite from the relentless heat.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the whispers of the plague already touched the edges of her journey.  The map, a faded parchment clutched in her hand, was her only guide through treacherous mountains and shadowed forests, a lifeline in a world teeming with both beauty and peril.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion, she navigated asteroid fields and nebulas, charting a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The thrill of exploration warred with the constant threat of cosmic anomalies and pirate raiders, the vast emptiness of space a stark contrast to the close-knit camaraderie of her crew.  Their journey, a gamble against the odds, held the promise of untold riches and knowledge, but also the terrifying possibility of oblivion.
