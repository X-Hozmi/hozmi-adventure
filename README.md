
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the towering crags, and the whispers of the desert itself spoke of thirst and despair.  Yet, the glint of gold in her worn satchel, a map clutched tight in her hand, spurred her onward, a testament to the unwavering human spirit seeking glory and fortune in the unforgiving embrace of the medieval world.


Centuries hence, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  But the void was not empty.  Pirate fleets roamed the black, and the unpredictable gravitational anomalies of the nebula threatened to crush her ship like a walnut.  Yet,  Lyra's resolve, fueled by the promise of discovery and the weight of human exploration on her shoulders, kept her course steady towards the uncharted wonders of the galaxy.
