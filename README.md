
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm mixing in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each wary glance over her shoulder at the vast, unforgiving landscape, fueled her resolve.  Bandits, wild animals, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions on her perilous journey, a testament to the raw, untamed nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, the cosmic dust painting vibrant hues across her viewport.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets in a far-flung galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, but the risks remained: unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  Eva's journey was a dance between cutting-edge technology and the uncharted wilderness of space, a testament to humanity's boundless, if sometimes reckless, ambition.
