
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days blurred into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and encounters with brigands and suspicious villagers. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, countered by the ever-present fear of the unknown that lay ahead, a fear as vast as the seemingly endless landscape itself.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, demanded unwavering vigilance against cosmic anomalies, pirate raids, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space. Yet, with each newly discovered system,  the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the thrill of potentially finding a new home for humanity fuelled her onward, a testament to the enduring human spirit's thirst for exploration.
