
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, ever vigilant for bandits and the whispers of the plague that stalks our land.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges: negotiating with wary villagers, bartering for supplies in bustling market towns, and facing the ever-present threat of the wild. The journey itself is the adventure, a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, charts unmapped nebulae, discovers lost alien civilizations, and faces the ever-present threat of pirates and hostile alien species.  The galaxy, an endless ocean of wonders and dangers, is their playground, and the pursuit of knowledge their ultimate adventure.
