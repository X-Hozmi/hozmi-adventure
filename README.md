
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence a fiery orange.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, and the whispers of the Black Death followed her like a malevolent shadow.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for disaster, yet the unwavering faith in her heart spurred her onward, fuelled by the hope of a blessed end to her arduous travels.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy.  The journey was perilous, traversing asteroid fields and dodging the predatory patrols of the Kryll Empire.  But the promise of untold power, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted reaches of the galaxy, pushed Jaxx and his crew relentlessly towards their destiny, a gamble with galactic proportions.
