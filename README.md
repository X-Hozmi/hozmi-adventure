
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the hill, the ravaged landscape of the Breton countryside stretching before them like a scarred tapestry.  Their mission, a desperate quest to retrieve a stolen relic from the clutches of a treacherous baron, pushed them ever onward.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the glint of potential glory, fueled their weary limbs and hardened hearts.  They were knights errant, bound not by king or crown, but by a fierce loyalty and the intoxicating promise of untold riches and legendary artifacts.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours painting the bridge in a kaleidoscope of light.  Their journey across the Andromeda galaxy was far removed from Kaelan's medieval struggles, yet the thrill of the unknown remained.  Warp drives hummed, a constant symphony against the vast silence of space.  They faced dangers far beyond bandits and famine: rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, new technologies, and perhaps even new life, propelled them onward,  a testament to humanity's unending thirst for exploration, a legacy begun in the dust and grit of long-ago adventures.
