
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's caravan lumbered across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a punctuation mark in the vast, silent landscape.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of the plague followed them like a malevolent phantom.  Yet, for Elara, the danger was a spice in the gruel of her journey – a quest to find the lost city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis said to hold the secrets of eternal life.  The journey was a gamble, a roll of the dice against the harsh realities of a medieval world, but the lure of the unknown propelled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of the void.  Pirates, not of the landlocked variety, but sentient beings from far-flung galaxies, haunted these star lanes, their vessels as deadly as any medieval siege weapon.  Jaxx's mission: to deliver a precious artifact to the Galactic Council – a task as perilous as any medieval pilgrimage, yet promising rewards beyond the wildest dreams of any medieval king.
