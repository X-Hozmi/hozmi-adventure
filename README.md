
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread and a chipped map, its ink smudged by rain and sweat.  This journey – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela – was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow. Yet, with each sunrise, a fierce determination burned within her, fueled by faith and the allure of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Kerrigan piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of breathtaking iridescent hues.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate ships was a constant struggle, but the promise of galactic exploration, of uncovering the secrets of the cosmos, eclipsed the dangers.  The vastness of space, a humbling and terrifying spectacle, held a siren's call that only a true adventurer could resist.
