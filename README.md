
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The map, a brittle parchment clutched in his sweat-stained hand, promised riches beyond imagining – a lost city said to hold the secrets of ancient kings.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, swirling river crossings, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  Each hardship only fueled his determination, the glint of potential glory outweighing the gnawing hunger and aching muscles.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, a vast expanse of interstellar space punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional meteor shower.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets – the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, burned just as brightly within her as it had in Sir Reginald's heart.
