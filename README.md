
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, famine, or worse – the cursed swamp said to swallow men whole.  His journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hope and desperation, a gamble against the brutal beauty of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, each warp jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and the vast emptiness of space held a chilling solitude. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her onward through the breathtaking expanse of the galaxy.
